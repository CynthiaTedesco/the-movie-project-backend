1
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:29,524
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

2
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:51,706
No, no, son. Over here.

3
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:55,114
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.

4
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:01,621
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up...

5
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:05,060
and be like your daddy someday,
you gotta learn how to fight.

6
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,728
Da-da.

7
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:11,400
Now, Alakay, let me
show you something, OK?

8
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:13,898
You see this mark?

9
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,401
You and me are the same.

10
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:19,973
When you're bigger,
you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.

11
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:22,808
Now let me see you fight. Ready?

12
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:25,580
No, Alakay. No dancing!

13
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:28,519
You just amuse yourself, don't you?

14
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:33,354
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one. I'm...

15
00:01:33,425 --> 00:01:35,689
Now, come on, let's try it again.

16
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,661
No, Alakay.

17
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:40,197
Stop that right now. Doggone it!

18
00:01:40,265 --> 00:01:43,701
It's so disappointing when they
don't grow up the way you want.

19
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:47,170
Makunga. You're not
challenging me again, are you?

20
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:51,642
Look on the bright side. After i defeat
you and become alpha lion,

21
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,838
you'll have more time
to spend with your pathetic son.

22
00:01:56,949 --> 00:02:00,214
Before i kick your butt, let me ask you:

23
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,879
Why do you want
to become the alpha lion?

24
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:06,220
I'm better looking, i have better hair,
i'm deceivingly smart...

25
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,623
...and i want everyone else
to do what i say.

26
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,962
We fight on three. One...

27
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:17,132
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.

28
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:18,800
Two, three!

29
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:43,758
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.

30
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:45,824
Don't you forget it.

31
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:48,999
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...

32
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:51,461
Alakay?

33
00:02:56,341 --> 00:03:00,334
That's it. Here, kitty, kitty.

34
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,241
This one's a beauty.

35
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:05,574
He'll be worth a few bucks.

36
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:08,846
It just gets easier and easier.

37
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:12,118
Daddy!

38
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,182
Alakay! Alakay!

39
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:16,593
Alakay!

40
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:21,190
Da-da!

41
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,691
No! No! No!

42
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:27,863
Alakay!

43
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:41,610
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you! Hold on!

44
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:48,049
Da-da!

45
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:04,732
Alakay!

46
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,248
Daddy!

47
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,166
I've been around the world
in the pouring rain

48
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:40,609
Feeling out of place
and feeling strange

49
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:43,671
Take me to a place
where they know my name

50
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:47,048
'Cause i ain't met nobody
that looks the same

51
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:50,213
i'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

52
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:53,918
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

53
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:57,120
i'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

54
00:04:57,195 --> 00:05:00,289
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

55
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,732
i need my peoples, my peoples
Take me to my peoples

56
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:07,535
Play that jungle fever
Show them some love

57
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:09,631
Show love

58
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,142
Just gotta have someone
Gotta have someone

59
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,804
To relate to, to relate to

60
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,643
i'm feeling right at home

61
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:19,980
feeling right at home
feeling right at home

62
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:23,488
feeling right at home
i'm feeling right at home

63
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:26,922
See i been traveling
Been traveling forever...

64
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:30,325
- i don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.

65
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:32,590
He's kind of a showoff.

66
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:34,996
You think he's cute?

67
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:49,343
Roar!

68
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,011
The King of New York City...

69
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:56,185
...Alex the Lion!

70
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:59,417
I still think he's kind of a showoff.

71
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:01,556
The guy's an animal.

72
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:05,619
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.

73
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:07,688
Come on, where would we go on vacation?

74
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:11,299
I don't know about you,
but i want to go to Connecticut!

75
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:15,563
On the loose, several animals, including
the world famous Alex the Lion,

76
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,734
escaped from
the Central Park Zoo tonight.

77
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,041
The escapees were cornered
in Grand Central Station.

78
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,214
He was a very bad kitty.

79
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,246
Animal rights activists,
who convinced zoo officials...

80
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,584
to have the animals sent to Africa,

81
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,988
were stunned to learn
that the freighter carrying the animals...

82
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,651
was reported missing today.

83
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:39,823
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers
have gathered at the zoo...

84
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:42,492
to mourn the loss
of their beloved zoo animals.

85
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:46,526
The question on everyone's mind,
where are they now?

86
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,110
I like to move it, move it

87
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:31,046
He likes to move it, move it

88
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:33,050
She likes to move it, move it

89
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:35,814
- We like to
- Move it!

90
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:40,381
Come on! Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!

91
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:42,117
- We like to
- Move it!

92
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:45,652
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!

93
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,130
Glad we could introduce
you to the toilet.

94
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,294
If you ever come look us up in
Manhattan, feel free to call first.

95
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:55,966
Seriously though, call. OK?

96
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:59,072
Settle down, everybody. Be quiet!

97
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:01,168
You can't leave without this!

98
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:03,540
Surprise, freaks!

99
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:06,307
Shake it! Shake it.

100
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:10,213
Look, i'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone!

101
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:14,653
I'm a lady! Not really!
It's me, King Julien!

102
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:18,895
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,994
Hey, freaks! You will be very glad
to hear that i am coming with you.

104
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:29,663
Oh, no, thank you.

105
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:33,009
Yes, thank you. It's my plane!

106
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:38,009
Until i return with the spoils
from the new country...

107
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,183
...Stevie will be in charge!

108
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:48,019
I don't think they like that idea.

109
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,351
What are you saying, Stevie?

110
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,288
No.

111
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:57,802
Could we...? No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?

112
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:01,737
Naughty little thing! Stevie says...

113
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:03,807
Let them eat cake!

114
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,810
King Julien, wait for me!

115
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:10,143
I'm all packed! I have
a whole itinerary planned!

116
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:13,211
Oh, no! It's Mort! He's so annoying!

117
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:15,453
Don't let him on. Stop that thing!

118
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,546
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!

119
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,553
Everybody in! Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!

120
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,095
- Struts.
- Check.

121
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,254
- Flaps.
- Check.

122
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:29,923
- Engine. Coffee maker.
- Check.

123
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:32,063
You guys!

124
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,569
Oopsie-daisy!

125
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:41,576
That has to be the second biggest
slingshot i've ever seen.

126
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:44,074
But it'll have to do. Attention.

127
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:45,749
This is your captain speaking.

128
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:48,976
In the event of an emergency,
place the vest over your head...

129
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:50,915
then kiss your... good-bye.

130
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:53,188
New York City, here we come!

131
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:55,988
Pray to your personal God
this hunk of junk flies.

132
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:58,195
Personal God, hunk...? What?

133
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:00,587
We are go, sir.

134
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:03,766
Open the door! I'm outside!

135
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:05,763
If cabin pressure is lost,

136
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:09,531
place the mask over your face
to hide your terrified expression.

137
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:13,767
Miss, aren't these supposed
to be attached to my seat?

138
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:16,277
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!

139
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,913
Launch!

140
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:20,110
- Launch!
- Launch!

141
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:02,486
Gremlin!

142
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:07,328
Hey, Mort.

143
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,592
Hi!

144
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:14,727
That was weird.

145
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:18,067
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think i saw Mort on the plane wing.

146
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:20,174
You got Madagascar on the brain.

147
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:21,777
I know i'm gonna miss it.

148
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:26,215
It was incredible. I think it'll seem
more fun the further we are from it.

149
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:27,945
Like when you bit me on the butt?

150
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:32,456
I'm gonna take that thing you're
holding onto and use it onstage.

151
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:36,290
It's all part of my little actor's salad
bar of emotional tidbits.

152
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:39,190
Are the butts next to the croutons?

153
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,462
You don't need to be sarcastic.

154
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:46,971
When we get back, i might sign up
for the breeding program.

155
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:48,096
Breeding program?

156
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:51,301
We reach a point when we
want to meet somebody.

157
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:53,810
Settle down, have a relationship.

158
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:55,004
I can see that.

159
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,345
What? Like dating?

160
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,974
Yeah, dating.

161
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:02,576
Other... other guys?

162
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,883
What do you mean, other guys?

163
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:10,725
Darn it!

164
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:14,888
What is holding up
that beverage service?!

165
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:17,064
I'm gonna go check.

166
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:20,595
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.

167
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:22,572
It's so funny!

168
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:27,610
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!

169
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,907
To laugh!

170
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:35,742
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.

171
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,621
It's nothing personal. We're just better
than you. Maurice, i'm open! Hit me!

172
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:43,058
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?

173
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:45,858
- In-flight slave.
- Can i help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?

174
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,626
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.

175
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,827
We were checking on our drink order.

176
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:53,093
Sorry. Been a little backed up.

177
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:55,736
- I guess i'll go back...
- Where's your body?

178
00:12:55,874 --> 00:13:00,311
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?

179
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:03,574
What happened to
the separation of the classes?

180
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,448
I'm sure this democracy thing
is just a fad.

181
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:10,952
We'll go out for pineapple,
my bobbly-headed boobly-boo.

182
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:12,520
Skipper, look.

183
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:14,318
Analysis.

184
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:18,556
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate
something unusual, like a malfunction.

185
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,825
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.

186
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:21,888
That too, sir.

187
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,297
Right! Rico?

188
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:24,524
Manual!

189
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,397
Problemo solved.

190
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:30,805
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?

191
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,542
We've lost engine one...

192
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:36,306
...and engine two is no longer on fire.

193
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:38,140
Buckle up, boys.

194
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,743
Don't look, doll. This might get hairy.

195
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:43,317
Attention! This is your captain.

196
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:47,082
I have good and bad news. The good
news is, we're landing immediately.

197
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:50,317
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.

198
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:56,263
When it comes to air travel,
we know you have no choice.

199
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:58,325
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.

200
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:14,182
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!

201
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:18,853
I can fly!

202
00:14:19,123 --> 00:14:23,787
This could be it, Marty! I want you to
know you are a one-in-a-million friend!

203
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,922
Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!

204
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,565
- And you won't mind when i tell you...
- Tell me anything!

205
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:32,432
I broke your iPod!

206
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:35,199
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!

207
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:37,537
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!

208
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:39,470
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!

209
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:41,269
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!

210
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:44,379
I love you, Gloria! I always have!

211
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:56,550
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book. Or the beach.

212
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:10,230
Goodness, doll,
you're shaking like a leaf.

213
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:12,236
Rico, you've had your fun.

214
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,568
Pull up.

215
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,169
Gear down.

216
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:21,315
Gently. You just want
to kiss the ground.

217
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:24,248
Just a peck, a smooch,
like you'd kiss your sister.

218
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:27,380
I said, kiss it!

219
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:35,532
Now just a little brake. Just a touch.

220
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:38,267
I believe that's checkmate.

221
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:48,935
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up! Deploy!

222
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:06,994
Oh, we're here.

223
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,826
What in the world?

224
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:14,605
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?

225
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:17,106
I'm OK. I'm alive.

226
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:21,202
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.

227
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,304
Kowalski, casualty report.

228
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:25,348
Two passengers unaccounted for.

229
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:28,346
That's a number i can live with.
Good landing, boys.

230
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:31,019
Who says a penguin can't fly?

231
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:36,086
Hey, happy slappers! Is there some
reason to celebrate? Look at the plane!

232
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:38,795
- We’ll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?

233
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:41,696
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.

234
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:45,730
We should be up and running
in, say, six to nine months.

235
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:48,738
- Sixty-nine months?!
- No, six to nine months.

236
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:51,536
Kowalski, i say we use
this setback to our advantage.

237
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:55,872
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.

238
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:57,638
How do you estimate that?

239
00:16:57,882 --> 00:17:01,283
Pretty boy! Why don't
you and your friends dig a latrine.

240
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:04,514
Hold on. Who made you king
of the plane wreck?

241
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:08,992
Excuse me? Fine. You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.

242
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,426
Who gives you the authority
to put me in charge?

243
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:13,555
OK, then i'll remain in charge.

244
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:15,493
Yeah, you will remain in charge.

245
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:18,228
You and your hippie friends
stay out of our hair.

246
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:21,135
Correcto-mundo. Because i decided to.

247
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:25,073
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.

248
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:27,476
Higher mammals! Stay with us.

249
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:30,571
We could use your front cortexes
and opposable thumbs.

250
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:34,578
Phil! I should wash
your hands out with soap.

251
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,355
How in the hell-o
will they fix this plane?!

252
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:41,415
You know, grit and spit and spit.

253
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:44,359
A lot of spit and grit and
stick-to-it-iveness.

254
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:46,693
That don't sound too promising.

255
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:49,289
You're right. We're stuck here.

256
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:53,360
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.

257
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:56,703
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.

258
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:59,106
Behold! The lion!

259
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,804
- People!
- There is much to see. Moving on.

260
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:04,280
Wait, wait, wait! People!

261
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:08,115
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!

262
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:10,944
- People! Stop!
- help us!

263
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:14,618
If you stop, i’ll autograph those!

264
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:17,223
I know you!

265
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:18,353
You.

266
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:20,454
It's the bad kitty.

267
00:18:28,873 --> 00:18:30,465
How do you like some of that?!

268
00:18:49,994 --> 00:18:51,655
Come in, Tokyo!

269
00:18:58,503 --> 00:18:59,834
Right in the batteries.

270
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:02,766
You think an old lady
can't take care of herself?

271
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:06,109
Next time, i won't go so easy on you!

272
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:08,572
Thank you, dear.

273
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:10,177
Moving on!

274
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,684
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?!

275
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:18,912
Out of my mind?

276
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:21,848
Who's out of my mind now?

277
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:24,292
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.

278
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:27,695
Out of my mind. We're going home.

279
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,370
Message E-4.

280
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:44,274
The service user has roamed
outside the coverage area.

281
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:46,881
please try again later.

282
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:52,887
Am i tripping?

283
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:56,391
all those zebras... like me.

284
00:19:57,395 --> 00:20:00,057
- Where are we?
- San Diego.

285
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:02,730
This time i'm 40 percent sure.

286
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:05,399
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.

287
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:06,625
Africa?

288
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:08,235
It's got to be.

289
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:11,064
Our ancestral crib.

290
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,504
It's in our blood. I can feel it!

291
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:16,235
No, it's more than that. It's like...

292
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:19,414
...déjà vu, like i've been here before.

293
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,242
It's like Roots!

294
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,986
No, it's like...

295
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:26,417
...déjà vu, like i've been here before.

296
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:28,756
How!

297
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:32,927
How!

298
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:38,428
Me Alex!

299
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:41,932
Me and me friends fly,

300
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:45,265
fly in great metal bird.

301
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:48,938
Then plummet!

302
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:51,278
Smash ground!

303
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:53,779
Go boom!

304
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:58,111
Then here we emerge.

305
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:01,482
We offer only happiness...

306
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,220
and good greetings.

307
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:06,623
Is he dancing about a plane crash?

308
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,129
Yeah. We just... yeah.

309
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:11,128
I thought... Sorry.

310
00:21:11,202 --> 00:21:13,363
You came from off the reserve?

311
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:16,471
Way off. From the Central Park Zoo,
actually.

312
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:25,805
Don't strain yourself.

313
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,245
What's going on here?

314
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,083
They say they're from off the reserve.

315
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:34,522
That's impossible. Only people
come from off the reserve.

316
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,753
You look familiar. Do i know you?

317
00:21:36,827 --> 00:21:39,352
How could you survive the hunters?

318
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,762
We didn't see any hunters.

319
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:43,697
- What are you looking at?
- Me? Nothing.

320
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:46,931
This watering hole doesn't need
any more mouths to feed.

321
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:49,503
So skedaddle back
to where you came from.

322
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,935
Is there a manager we could talk to?

323
00:21:52,176 --> 00:21:55,077
I see. You're here to challenge me!

324
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:56,836
What? No! No.

325
00:21:57,081 --> 00:21:58,742
That's what it looks like to me!

326
00:21:59,016 --> 00:22:00,347
Zuba! Wait.

327
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:02,347
I'm trying to take care of business...

328
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,082
Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on.

329
00:22:05,756 --> 00:22:07,087
Alakay?

330
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:09,189
Is that you?

331
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:12,760
No, it's Alex. Ix. Like New York Knicks.

332
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,123
Zuba, look!

333
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:18,191
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.

334
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:20,527
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.

335
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:22,299
A mark.

336
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:25,869
all right, this is a little weird.

337
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:29,038
Honey, he's come home.

338
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:31,074
What?

339
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:33,046
You've come home.

340
00:22:41,392 --> 00:22:42,450
Son.

341
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:49,722
Dad.

342
00:22:51,902 --> 00:22:54,837
Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad!

343
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:58,238
Mom and Dad! It's my mom and dad!

344
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:00,804
I got a mom and dad!

345
00:23:01,078 --> 00:23:02,409
My baby's alive!

346
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,011
Dad!

347
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:05,909
My son!

348
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:09,246
My son is home!

349
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:14,249
Alakay! Alakay has come home!

350
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:22,759
Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!

351
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:25,260
I thought you hated Zuba.

352
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:30,036
No, i do. I do. I do.
I hate him. Oh, i do.

353
00:23:30,107 --> 00:23:32,632
And i'm going to use Alakay, yes.

354
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,271
I'm going to use him
to get rid of Zuba once and for all!

355
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:38,106
Giddy-up, feathered horse!

356
00:23:38,182 --> 00:23:41,049
Make way!
Move out of the way! Stand aside!

357
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:42,779
New York!

358
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,056
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?

359
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:50,389
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!

360
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:52,725
This calls for a celebration!

361
00:23:52,797 --> 00:23:54,662
Maurice, i think they like me.

362
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:57,292
You've got to love
a non-hostile takeover!

363
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:00,626
Chukka-chukka what?

364
00:24:07,077 --> 00:24:11,207
Excuse me. I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.

365
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:13,743
Hey, Marty!

366
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,220
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?

367
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:22,992
Yeah. Running is crack-a-lacking.

368
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:25,761
That's right! Crack-a-lacking.

369
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,856
You guys speak
my crack-a-lacking language.

370
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:31,367
What? You don't have doctors here?

371
00:24:31,435 --> 00:24:32,925
Not anymore.

372
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:35,494
Well, what if you catch a cold?

373
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:38,667
We go over to the dying holse
and we die.

374
00:24:41,111 --> 00:24:43,409
You guys really need a doctor.

375
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,678
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?

376
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,241
Me? A doctor?

377
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:57,522
It's raining men. Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.

378
00:24:57,595 --> 00:25:00,621
Why don't you have a man? You got worms?

379
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:03,222
Oh, i got rid of those. Listen, girls.

380
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:06,395
Manhattan is short on two things,
parking and hippos.

381
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,598
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son...

382
00:25:09,673 --> 00:25:13,609
is a doggone king!
The King of New York!

383
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:18,411
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.

384
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:21,144
all right. This one
always knocks them dead.

385
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:23,077
Roar!

386
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:27,214
Look out. The King is mad.
The King is mad!

387
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:32,160
Let's welcome him back
into the pride with open arms!

388
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,664
Welcome to the herd, Marty!

389
00:25:37,735 --> 00:25:41,102
Me? I've always wanted
to be part of a herd!

390
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:44,504
- It's one for all...
- And all for all, y'all!

391
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,641
How do i look?

392
00:25:47,912 --> 00:25:52,906
Technically, a traditional witch doctor
has a bone through his nose.

393
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:55,583
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.

394
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:58,316
Voilà! He's a witch doctor!

395
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:00,988
My mother will be so happy.

396
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:08,992
Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you.

397
00:26:11,435 --> 00:26:12,766
Here he comes.

398
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:17,337
I like them big

399
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,775
i like them chunky

400
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,944
i like them big
i like them plumpy

401
00:26:24,014 --> 00:26:27,711
i like them round
With somethin' something

402
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:31,016
They like my sound
They think i'm funky

403
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:33,454
Goodness, girl... you huge.

404
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:35,784
Who's your friend? Or is that your butt?

405
00:26:37,227 --> 00:26:39,218
You as quick as you are hefty.

406
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:41,863
So you're Moto Moto?

407
00:26:41,932 --> 00:26:44,127
The name's so nice, you say it twice.

408
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:46,029
I kind of like it, fatso.

409
00:26:46,103 --> 00:26:50,301
I'll see you around, girl. It won't
be hard, because you so... plumpy.

410
00:26:57,648 --> 00:26:58,706
Oops!

411
00:27:00,718 --> 00:27:03,050
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba,

412
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,586
but some of the lions were wondering
when you plan to banish your son.

413
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:11,090
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.

414
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:13,789
They're griping that Alakay
never went through...

415
00:27:13,864 --> 00:27:15,957
the rite of passage,
blah, blah, blah,

416
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:21,437
so technically speaking, he can't be
a member of the pride. It's nonsense.

417
00:27:21,505 --> 00:27:23,803
I forgot about the rite of passage.

418
00:27:23,874 --> 00:27:26,138
What is it? What's this rite of passage?

419
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,735
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.

420
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:32,540
Young lions earn their manes
by demonstrating their skills.

421
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:36,347
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah. Strutting their stuff.

422
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,548
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.

423
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:43,457
If it's tradition, i want to do it.
Strut my stuff. Earn my mane.

424
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:45,290
I want to be Alaki.

425
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:47,694
- Alakay.
- Alakay! Even better.

426
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:50,359
We will hold the rite
of passage in the morning!

427
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:53,130
That's wonderful! Good luck, Alakay.

428
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:55,467
Where i'm from, we say, "Break a leg. "

429
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:57,700
That's my boy!

430
00:28:04,114 --> 00:28:06,912
I'm a private dancer

431
00:28:06,984 --> 00:28:09,452
A dancer for money

432
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:19,385
Any old music will do

433
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:24,063
Beautiful, isn't it?

434
00:28:24,134 --> 00:28:26,125
It's amazing.

435
00:28:27,004 --> 00:28:28,335
Guys...

436
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:31,064
...this is where we belong.

437
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,142
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

438
00:28:35,412 --> 00:28:37,277
Oh, i like that one.

439
00:28:37,347 --> 00:28:39,076
It works on many levels.

440
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:40,946
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

441
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:42,508
- That, too.
- Absolutely.

442
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:44,417
Stations.

443
00:28:44,488 --> 00:28:46,479
Stage one. Go!

444
00:29:00,504 --> 00:29:03,029
Oh, no! What have i done?

445
00:29:03,273 --> 00:29:04,604
Come on, take the bait.

446
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:07,303
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.

447
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:08,935
Is it dead?

448
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:12,173
Stage two! Go, go, go!

449
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:22,385
I will give him the kiss of life.

450
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:25,050
Rico!

451
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,094
Rico!

452
00:29:32,302 --> 00:29:33,667
Reverse!

453
00:29:33,737 --> 00:29:34,726
Gas!

454
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:36,067
Music!

455
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:39,466
No! Stop! Stop!

456
00:29:41,078 --> 00:29:42,409
Stop!

457
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:43,977
Come back!

458
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,745
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?!

459
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:56,089
Is she dead?

460
00:29:56,894 --> 00:29:57,883
No!

461
00:30:06,003 --> 00:30:07,903
You hoodlums!

462
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:11,772
Good heavens! Are you OK?

463
00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:15,039
Lady, i found your pocketbook.

464
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:18,843
My handbag. Such a good boy.

465
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:21,111
Nana can't survive without it.

466
00:30:21,351 --> 00:30:23,342
You are one tough cookie.

467
00:30:23,587 --> 00:30:26,420
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.

468
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,290
OK, nobody panic! The best thing
we can do is stay together.

469
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,955
We’ll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours, but...

470
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:35,123
Where are you going?

471
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:40,595
I'm not staying here to be attacked
by more animals! I'm too old to die.

472
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:45,466
I'm going with her. old lady, wait up!

473
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:48,276
please! We need to stay...

474
00:30:48,812 --> 00:30:50,143
...together.

475
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:53,272
Fine! We’ll go that way!

476
00:30:53,617 --> 00:30:55,949
Does anyone want a hard candy?

477
00:30:59,957 --> 00:31:02,152
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.

478
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:06,626
And right here... OK, are you ready?

479
00:31:08,632 --> 00:31:10,896
This is where you always slept.

480
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:12,629
Oh, man!

481
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:19,964
- Was this mine?
- Look at you. Look at him.

482
00:31:20,744 --> 00:31:23,406
Oh, this thing. Look, look!

483
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:26,313
- I remember this!
- He remembers.

484
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:28,306
A little harder than...

485
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:32,316
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.

486
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,316
Is that...?

487
00:31:34,658 --> 00:31:35,989
Is that my...?

488
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:39,326
Is that me?

489
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:42,093
You had the cutest little paws.

490
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:44,664
Little, little bitty oi' paws.

491
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:47,664
You did that the day we lost you.

492
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:51,668
Wow. I was so young.

493
00:31:52,342 --> 00:31:53,707
What happened to me?

494
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:58,205
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...

495
00:31:58,282 --> 00:32:00,273
it was not your fault.

496
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:05,544
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.

497
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:07,220
Far off the reserve.

498
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:10,551
Finally, i had to assume the hunters...

499
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:12,017
...well...

500
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:15,695
We thought they'd killed you.

501
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:20,367
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!

502
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:22,127
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.

503
00:32:22,372 --> 00:32:26,570
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.

504
00:32:28,045 --> 00:32:30,843
You used to call this "foofie. "

505
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:32,404
"Foofie"?

506
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,649
Foofie.

507
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:36,242
He doesn't want that.

508
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,912
This is my foofie!

509
00:32:40,891 --> 00:32:42,916
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

510
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:47,259
I mean, no, thank you,
thank you. It's perfect.

511
00:32:47,597 --> 00:32:50,930
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.

512
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:53,429
you’ll need all your strength.

513
00:32:53,503 --> 00:32:55,937
I will bring the house down for you.

514
00:32:56,406 --> 00:33:00,001
I hope so. Otherwise,
your father will have to banish you.

515
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,077
Jeez, Mom, really?

516
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:05,338
I know you’ll do us proud. You know why?

517
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,282
You were born with it.

518
00:33:10,754 --> 00:33:12,278
Good night, Alakay.

519
00:33:12,622 --> 00:33:15,284
My boy. My own boy.

520
00:33:17,761 --> 00:33:19,626
My son's a king.

521
00:33:20,764 --> 00:33:22,629
My son's a king.

522
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:34,300
Good night, Mom.

523
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:37,303
Good night, Alakay.

524
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:45,454
Foofie.

525
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:48,321
Look at foofie! My foofie!

526
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:52,554
Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie!

527
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:58,131
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.

528
00:33:58,468 --> 00:34:00,459
I think we're lost.

529
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:03,331
Nana, do you know where you're going?

530
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:08,071
No, but i'm going with a skip
in my step and a smile on my face.

531
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:10,477
Sure, right, OK. Yeah, all right.

532
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:15,683
- It's people.
- How did you get here?

533
00:34:15,752 --> 00:34:18,414
- Can you help us? We're lost.
- We're lost too.

534
00:34:18,488 --> 00:34:23,152
It was awful. A flash of black and white
and they were gone. They took the jeep!

535
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:25,990
- That happened to our jeep too!
- What do we do?

536
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,428
How will we all survive?

537
00:34:27,497 --> 00:34:31,490
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?!

538
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:36,438
You can let nature
get the best of you,

539
00:34:36,506 --> 00:34:38,940
or you can get the best of nature.

540
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:45,245
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?

541
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:46,577
Yeah.

542
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:50,108
We survive the concrete jungle!

543
00:34:50,187 --> 00:34:53,623
When we need food, we hunt
for a decent hot dog stand.

544
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,351
- Am i right?
- She's right.

545
00:34:55,425 --> 00:34:58,861
When we need shelter,
we build skyscrapers.

546
00:34:58,962 --> 00:35:03,422
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.

547
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,662
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!

548
00:35:05,735 --> 00:35:08,135
If we can make it there,

549
00:35:08,205 --> 00:35:10,730
we can make it anywhere!

550
00:35:26,923 --> 00:35:29,084
I'm coming, King Julien!

551
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,931
Bad fishy! Bad fishy!

552
00:35:39,603 --> 00:35:41,935
No, shark, no! Sit!

553
00:35:44,274 --> 00:35:46,105
Why am i laughing?

554
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,048
We have all the parts we need,
but we're slightly behind schedule.

555
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:56,483
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.

556
00:35:56,553 --> 00:35:59,784
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.

557
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:02,589
Private! What happened to our thumbs?

558
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:04,718
Haven't seen them since yesterday.

559
00:36:04,794 --> 00:36:06,625
Darn you, Darwin!

560
00:36:06,696 --> 00:36:11,633
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private! You're coming with me.

561
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:14,634
Rico! You're coming with me!

562
00:36:15,305 --> 00:36:19,298
- We’ll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!

563
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:22,971
We've recruited
a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

564
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:31,317
Well, i’ll be a monkey's uncle.

565
00:36:31,655 --> 00:36:33,486
Oh, i doubt that.

566
00:36:39,996 --> 00:36:42,157
Enough lollygagging. Let's get to work.

567
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:46,267
There'll be three groups. Group alpha
will do sheet metal fabrication.

568
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:50,567
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.

569
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,005
Any questions?

570
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:54,833
Good! Let's get to work.

571
00:37:02,185 --> 00:37:05,018
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.

572
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:08,847
all right, but you're so darn ugly.

573
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:19,434
Remember, little cub scouts, a great
dance performance comes from the heart.

574
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,861
Straight from the heart,
you'll never go wrong.

575
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:25,800
Sure, mister.

576
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:29,902
Hey, Alakay, i just happened to walk by,
i thought i'd wish you luck.

577
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,472
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.

578
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,316
In my opinion, the key to this
is choosing the right competitor.

579
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:40,652
You mean, this is like
a dance battle sort of thing?

580
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:42,783
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.

581
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:45,220
Great. I love that. Freestyle.

582
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:49,396
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.

583
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:52,394
Well, i wish i could help,

584
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:56,230
but that's strictly against our ancient
tradition and all we hold sacred.

585
00:37:56,473 --> 00:38:00,000
But if it was me out there...
i'd choose Teetsi.

586
00:38:00,744 --> 00:38:04,180
Teetsi. OK. Sounds interesting.

587
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:05,737
Makunga, right? Thank you.

588
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:08,484
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get them, tiger.

589
00:38:08,752 --> 00:38:10,083
Shake it out.

590
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:12,585
A five, six, seven, eight.

591
00:38:12,922 --> 00:38:15,254
Let's go, let’s do this.

592
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,101
Let us begin
the rite of passage ceremony.

593
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:39,512
- Come on, baby! Make Mama proud!
- Woman, i'm trying to take...

594
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:40,776
On it, Mom!

595
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,613
Who will be the first participant?

596
00:38:42,686 --> 00:38:45,280
Me! Oh! Me, me, me!
Me! Me! Me! Me, me! Please, me?

597
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:47,954
How about you? The tall, handsome one.

598
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:49,954
Yeah. Choose your opponent.

599
00:38:50,627 --> 00:38:52,288
Let me see.

600
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:55,954
I guess i'll pick...

601
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:00,058
...Teetsi?

602
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:04,540
Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

603
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:08,141
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!

604
00:39:08,978 --> 00:39:10,809
Somebody, wake him up!

605
00:39:24,427 --> 00:39:27,260
all right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?

606
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:31,824
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

607
00:39:32,102 --> 00:39:34,070
- Let's dance!
- OK.

608
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:36,901
But let me warn you
that i am a protégé of...

609
00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:39,835
...Fosse and Robbins!

610
00:39:40,176 --> 00:39:42,667
Not "dance" dance! Fight!

611
00:39:43,513 --> 00:39:45,845
Dance fight! You got it.

612
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:54,454
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?

613
00:39:54,524 --> 00:39:56,856
I know that boy is not dancing.

614
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:59,688
This is even better than i thought.

615
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:04,022
Alakay, turn around!

616
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:08,465
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle,
ball change, hip swish, turn around.

617
00:40:18,214 --> 00:40:19,875
Oh, no.

618
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,211
Alakay! Are you hurt?

619
00:40:23,553 --> 00:40:25,214
Yeah, i am.

620
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:27,285
Did i... did i win?

621
00:40:27,357 --> 00:40:28,688
No, son.

622
00:40:28,758 --> 00:40:30,817
How could this happen?

623
00:40:30,894 --> 00:40:34,955
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.

624
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:39,058
I am a king. I'm the King of New York.

625
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:43,528
It's my stage name.
Like for when i perform.

626
00:40:43,606 --> 00:40:44,766
Perform?

627
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:49,175
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!

628
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:54,410
Who would have ever imagined
that today Zuba would have to banish...

629
00:40:55,084 --> 00:40:56,676
...his own son?

630
00:40:56,753 --> 00:40:58,812
Zuba, no.

631
00:40:58,922 --> 00:41:00,787
Zuba, yes.

632
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:04,924
Sadly, the alpha lion
must cast out all failures.

633
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:20,007
Then i'm no longer the alpha lion.

634
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,771
Dad, what are you doing?

635
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:25,945
Dad, no! You can't do this.

636
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:30,686
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

637
00:41:31,788 --> 00:41:32,948
Anyone?

638
00:41:33,289 --> 00:41:35,120
Someone? No one?

639
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:37,549
You, sir!

640
00:41:37,627 --> 00:41:39,219
I guess not.

641
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:42,287
Well, i... this is all very awkward,

642
00:41:42,632 --> 00:41:46,124
but i suppose i could carry
this tremendous burden.

643
00:41:47,804 --> 00:41:50,136
Teetsi! Get the hat.

644
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:55,642
As your new leader,
i hereby banish Alakay!

645
00:41:55,979 --> 00:41:57,970
He shall wear this Hat of Shame...

646
00:41:58,248 --> 00:42:00,978
...and leave the watering hole...

647
00:42:01,317 --> 00:42:03,808
for a thousand years, or life!

648
00:42:05,154 --> 00:42:06,815
Whichever comes last.

649
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:12,661
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

650
00:42:12,996 --> 00:42:17,160
You should have told us
you weren't a real king, son!

651
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,800
You never told me
i'd have to fight anybody!

652
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:21,166
What did you expect?!

653
00:42:21,237 --> 00:42:25,799
I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly
advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"

654
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:28,673
- You're a lion!
- But i never fought another lion!

655
00:42:28,745 --> 00:42:30,645
No, i guess not. You dance!

656
00:42:30,713 --> 00:42:34,774
And other stuff! Your pal, Makunga,
set me up back there!

657
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:37,615
- None of this would have happened...
- if you were a real lion.

658
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:39,416
- Zuba!
- Yeah, i said it!

659
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,851
A real lion.

660
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,191
Thanks.

661
00:42:48,531 --> 00:42:50,021
Thanks a lot.

662
00:42:59,976 --> 00:43:01,204
Saw.

663
00:43:02,545 --> 00:43:03,876
Suture.

664
00:43:05,715 --> 00:43:07,046
Swab.

665
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:08,648
You're in my light, Stephen.

666
00:43:08,885 --> 00:43:11,547
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.

667
00:43:11,788 --> 00:43:16,316
That's very observant, Stephen. As you
can see, i'm covered in brown spots.

668
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,051
OK! That bone will be good
as new in a few weeks.

669
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,457
So i don't have
to pick out a dying hole?

670
00:43:22,665 --> 00:43:24,997
No, you got
your whole life ahead of you.

671
00:43:25,068 --> 00:43:27,502
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.

672
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:31,233
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg! Sweet kid.

673
00:43:31,474 --> 00:43:34,341
This spot looks
like Witch Doctor's Disease.

674
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:39,746
Witch Doctor's Disease? That's the most
ridiculous disease i've ever heard of.

675
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:42,915
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.

676
00:43:44,687 --> 00:43:45,676
This won't hurt a bit.

677
00:43:45,922 --> 00:43:50,188
Joe, our last witch doctor,
had a spot just like that.

678
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:54,423
- And?
- Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

679
00:43:55,164 --> 00:43:56,495
Wednesday, no Joe?

680
00:43:56,699 --> 00:43:59,031
I can breathe! Thanks, doc!

681
00:43:59,268 --> 00:44:03,170
So this Witch Doctor's Disease
is a real thing?

682
00:44:03,506 --> 00:44:07,033
you’ll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!

683
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,203
But i've never heard of it.

684
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:12,543
I mean... i don't have any penicillin.

685
00:44:12,615 --> 00:44:15,049
I'll need a OAT scan
just to get started!

686
00:44:15,118 --> 00:44:18,451
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.

687
00:44:29,165 --> 00:44:30,154
Ta-da!

688
00:44:30,466 --> 00:44:33,060
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.

689
00:44:33,136 --> 00:44:34,660
Hollah!

690
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:38,901
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked them dead in New York!

691
00:44:38,975 --> 00:44:40,966
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!

692
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,710
Well, you can try all you want to,

693
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,805
but it takes years of practice.

694
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:47,907
you’ll never get a tight stream...

695
00:44:47,984 --> 00:44:52,444
until you build up your lip muscles
to the point where you can...

696
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:54,683
purse your lips like this.
You got it?

697
00:45:08,504 --> 00:45:09,664
Ta-da!

698
00:45:13,509 --> 00:45:16,740
How did you...? You guys got it
right out of the box!

699
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:18,610
- If you can do it...
... we can do it.

700
00:45:18,681 --> 00:45:19,909
It's in our blood!

701
00:45:20,183 --> 00:45:22,913
I always thought i was a bit unique.

702
00:45:22,985 --> 00:45:24,179
We are unique!

703
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:26,251
We are like a force of nature!

704
00:45:26,522 --> 00:45:29,184
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!

705
00:45:29,258 --> 00:45:31,453
Exactly the same!

706
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:34,852
Exactly the same.

707
00:45:36,265 --> 00:45:39,860
Looks impressive,
Kowalski, but will it fly?

708
00:45:40,203 --> 00:45:43,695
Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

709
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:46,864
Nice.

710
00:45:59,388 --> 00:46:03,381
Oh, man. My dad thinks
i'm a total loser.

711
00:46:03,626 --> 00:46:05,389
I've ruined my parents' lives.

712
00:46:05,628 --> 00:46:07,562
That is definitely not crack-a-lacking.

713
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:12,294
It is lacking in the cracking,
my friend. I've gotta fix this.

714
00:46:12,568 --> 00:46:13,728
So...

715
00:46:14,737 --> 00:46:18,229
...there's...
There's something i gotta tell you.

716
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:19,396
Hey, guys.

717
00:46:20,409 --> 00:46:22,309
Is this place great or what?!

718
00:46:22,645 --> 00:46:24,340
I'd go with "or what. "

719
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:28,076
Well, i’ll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but...

720
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:31,075
...i got a date with Moto Moto.

721
00:46:31,921 --> 00:46:33,411
Who's Moto Moto?

722
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:37,084
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!

723
00:46:37,426 --> 00:46:39,758
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?

724
00:46:39,996 --> 00:46:41,759
It means, "Hot Hot. "

725
00:46:41,964 --> 00:46:43,056
"Hot Hot"?

726
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:45,928
When did you start parlez-ing African?

727
00:46:46,202 --> 00:46:47,191
It's in my blood.

728
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:51,065
Don't worry, you can flirt around
with Mr. Hot Pants after i'm gone.

729
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,007
Melman, why am i the parade
and you're the rain?

730
00:46:54,076 --> 00:46:56,237
Why are you driving
your parade under my rain?

731
00:46:56,312 --> 00:46:59,008
Maybe i’ll parade
in another part of town!

732
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:00,480
Whoa, guys.

733
00:47:00,683 --> 00:47:02,173
Main Street's mine!

734
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:04,412
Well, you can have it!

735
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:08,617
And you can take your hotee-tot float
and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...

736
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:10,882
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?

737
00:47:11,127 --> 00:47:12,458
Melman, just tell her.

738
00:47:12,795 --> 00:47:16,458
What? What are you...
i don't know what you're talking about.

739
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:18,098
I guess i’ll go, then.

740
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:19,566
Don't bother.

741
00:47:19,635 --> 00:47:23,230
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman! Gloria!

742
00:47:23,306 --> 00:47:27,640
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.

743
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,473
- Marty?
- Marty?

744
00:47:29,645 --> 00:47:30,703
Marty?

745
00:47:31,647 --> 00:47:33,308
What the heck is going on?

746
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:38,577
You're not...? Oh! He was... i thought
he... You're not him. He's... Oh.

747
00:47:38,654 --> 00:47:41,418
You thought that guy...

748
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:42,752
...was me?

749
00:47:42,825 --> 00:47:45,589
No. I mean, yes, you... Guys, come on.

750
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:47,822
You thought i was him?

751
00:47:48,164 --> 00:47:50,155
You guys kind of do look a little...

752
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:52,895
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.

753
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:56,837
You laugh alike. Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.

754
00:47:56,906 --> 00:47:59,966
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on. Marty.

755
00:48:00,076 --> 00:48:03,204
So you're saying there's
nothing unique about me.

756
00:48:03,412 --> 00:48:05,505
I'm just like any other zebra.

757
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:07,173
No. Of course you're different!

758
00:48:07,516 --> 00:48:08,847
How?

759
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:12,680
OK, i can't tell you apart.

760
00:48:13,022 --> 00:48:15,820
Maybe you could wear
a bell or something.

761
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:18,520
- A bell?!
- OK, not a bell. Bell's a bad idea.

762
00:48:18,861 --> 00:48:21,523
How about a T-shirt that says,
"i'm with stupid"?

763
00:48:21,764 --> 00:48:24,289
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid! Him, stupid!

764
00:48:24,533 --> 00:48:27,866
You know, while you've been doing
the prancing pony with your new posse,

765
00:48:28,104 --> 00:48:31,369
i've been having
the worst day of my life.

766
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:35,040
It's always about you, isn't it?

767
00:48:35,378 --> 00:48:38,643
My problems are just
a little bit bigger than yours.

768
00:48:38,714 --> 00:48:41,547
I couldn't tell you apart. So what?!

769
00:48:42,218 --> 00:48:44,880
Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!

770
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:48,215
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!

771
00:48:48,457 --> 00:48:51,722
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?

772
00:48:53,996 --> 00:48:57,261
Your one-of-a-million friend
hopes you enjoy...

773
00:48:57,333 --> 00:49:00,166
your bigger-than-anyone-eise's
problems alone!

774
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:03,864
Good, leave! I don't need you
to help me solve my problems!

775
00:49:03,906 --> 00:49:07,069
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!

776
00:49:07,143 --> 00:49:10,169
Which one's Marty? Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, i don't care!

777
00:49:10,246 --> 00:49:12,908
Nice hat, you showoff!

778
00:49:18,421 --> 00:49:19,752
Marty...

779
00:49:20,756 --> 00:49:22,246
...don't go.

780
00:49:22,591 --> 00:49:24,256
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

781
00:49:27,263 --> 00:49:28,594
Look, Maurice!

782
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,163
The perfect spot for my summer palace!

783
00:49:31,434 --> 00:49:35,268
Please fill in all these holes
and relocate the riff-raff.

784
00:49:36,372 --> 00:49:39,603
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.

785
00:49:39,942 --> 00:49:42,934
tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

786
00:49:43,279 --> 00:49:45,509
I'm terminal, you know?

787
00:49:46,515 --> 00:49:50,042
I probably only have
another two days left to live.

788
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:52,447
That's a bummer, man.

789
00:49:52,788 --> 00:49:55,450
If i, King Julien... that's my name...

790
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:57,952
...only had two days left to live,

791
00:49:58,294 --> 00:49:59,727
i would do all the things...

792
00:49:59,795 --> 00:50:02,286
- i've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?

793
00:50:02,365 --> 00:50:05,391
I'd love to become
a professional whistler.

794
00:50:05,468 --> 00:50:09,734
I'm pretty amazing at it now,
but i want to get even better,

795
00:50:09,805 --> 00:50:11,796
make my living out of it.

796
00:50:20,149 --> 00:50:25,416
You know what else i would do?
I would invade a neighboring country...

797
00:50:25,488 --> 00:50:29,424
and impose my own ideology,
even if they didn't want it!

798
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:31,426
Easy for you to say. You're a king.

799
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,653
Yes. And you are
only just a sad little head.

800
00:50:35,898 --> 00:50:39,766
There must be something
you want to do before you die!

801
00:50:39,835 --> 00:50:43,771
- There is this one thing.
- What? tell me.

802
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,831
- No, i couldn't.
- What is it?

803
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:49,503
I never told Gloria
how i feel about her.

804
00:50:49,578 --> 00:50:51,443
What is it? Please tell me!

805
00:50:51,514 --> 00:50:55,280
I never had the guts
to tell Gloria how i feel about her.

806
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:56,943
How i've always felt about her.

807
00:50:57,019 --> 00:50:58,850
Fine. Don't tell me!

808
00:51:00,022 --> 00:51:04,118
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.

809
00:51:04,193 --> 00:51:08,527
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.

810
00:51:08,864 --> 00:51:10,798
Yeah. Yeah.

811
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:12,800
You're right.

812
00:51:12,868 --> 00:51:16,133
You've got to march
right up to this woman.

813
00:51:16,205 --> 00:51:19,538
Look her right in the eye. Lean forward.

814
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:22,366
Just a little, or almost all the way.

815
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:26,647
Then you let her lean forward
a little until you're...

816
00:51:26,715 --> 00:51:30,151
...just lips' distance
away from each other.

817
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:33,882
Then you tell her how much you hate her.

818
00:51:34,223 --> 00:51:38,455
Actually, it's more like love her.

819
00:51:38,527 --> 00:51:41,394
Oh, you siy dog! Woof, woof!

820
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:45,063
You're a real player. Now listen to me.

821
00:51:45,301 --> 00:51:47,963
You got to rise up. You hearing me?

822
00:51:48,237 --> 00:51:49,636
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!

823
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:52,740
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!

824
00:51:53,309 --> 00:51:56,301
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!

825
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:58,410
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!

826
00:51:58,647 --> 00:52:01,411
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!

827
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:03,307
Do you feel it?

828
00:52:03,752 --> 00:52:06,084
- Go up to her face!
- tell the truth!

829
00:52:06,422 --> 00:52:11,325
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, i dig you!"

830
00:52:11,594 --> 00:52:14,586
Yeah! I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!

831
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,194
I love that happy little head.

832
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:19,425
She love

833
00:52:19,668 --> 00:52:21,329
Moto Moto

834
00:52:22,004 --> 00:52:23,528
She love

835
00:52:23,772 --> 00:52:25,103
Moto Moto

836
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:28,777
She loves me
She loves my eyes

837
00:52:29,445 --> 00:52:32,778
She loves me
She loves my thighs

838
00:52:33,115 --> 00:52:34,946
She loves my roundness

839
00:52:35,284 --> 00:52:39,118
She love that i'm chunky
She love that i'm plumpy

840
00:52:39,455 --> 00:52:43,289
She love my heftiness
She love my zestiness

841
00:52:43,626 --> 00:52:47,460
She love me restlessly
She love me forever

842
00:52:47,796 --> 00:52:49,491
She love me...

843
00:52:49,632 --> 00:52:51,224
...'cause she love me

844
00:52:51,467 --> 00:52:52,798
Moto Moto...

845
00:52:53,302 --> 00:52:56,465
...before things get too serious, well,

846
00:52:56,805 --> 00:53:00,798
i was wondering,
if i were to, for example, stay here...

847
00:53:01,143 --> 00:53:02,474
...i'd like to ask you...

848
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:07,145
Let your candied lips be
the messengers to my... ear canal.

849
00:53:07,716 --> 00:53:09,581
I have so many questions.

850
00:53:09,818 --> 00:53:13,254
I promise the answer will always be yes.

851
00:53:13,322 --> 00:53:15,984
Unless no is required.

852
00:53:16,058 --> 00:53:20,324
So what is it about me
that you find so interesting?

853
00:53:21,063 --> 00:53:23,930
You're the most plumpenest girl
i've ever met.

854
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:25,933
OK. Other than that.

855
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:27,662
Let's see.

856
00:53:27,736 --> 00:53:30,728
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.

857
00:53:31,674 --> 00:53:33,005
Right.

858
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,342
My gosh, girl, you huge.

859
00:53:37,613 --> 00:53:38,602
You said that.

860
00:53:38,847 --> 00:53:40,838
Yeah, that's right.

861
00:53:41,684 --> 00:53:43,515
We don't have to talk no more.

862
00:53:43,752 --> 00:53:44,946
Gloria!

863
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:47,280
Gloria.

864
00:53:47,523 --> 00:53:48,683
Melman.

865
00:53:50,192 --> 00:53:54,526
Melman, i want you to meet Moto Moto.

866
00:53:55,531 --> 00:53:59,695
Moto Moto. Yeah, nice to meet you.

867
00:54:00,035 --> 00:54:03,664
- I guess i...
- it's OK, Melman.

868
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:05,263
Apology accepted.

869
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:10,040
Oh. Yeah, right, that.
That's why i... Good.

870
00:54:11,046 --> 00:54:13,514
OK. Well, that's it, then.

871
00:54:13,582 --> 00:54:16,710
Good. We're kind of busy here, man.

872
00:54:17,052 --> 00:54:19,543
No. No, that's not it.

873
00:54:21,056 --> 00:54:24,048
Listen, Mototo, you better treat
this lady like a queen.

874
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,893
Because you, my friend,
you found yourself the perfect woman.

875
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,655
If i was ever so lucky
to find the perfect woman,

876
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:34,499
i'd give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers. OK?

877
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:38,506
Her favorites are orchids.
White. And breakfast in bed.

878
00:54:38,574 --> 00:54:40,940
Six loaves of wheat toast,
butter on both sides.

879
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,671
No crust, the way she likes it.

880
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:46,244
I'd be her shoulder to cry on
and her best friend.

881
00:54:46,482 --> 00:54:50,009
I'd spend every day thinking
of how to make her laugh.

882
00:54:50,085 --> 00:54:53,748
She has the most amazing laugh.

883
00:54:57,092 --> 00:55:00,084
That's what i would do if i were you.

884
00:55:00,429 --> 00:55:02,761
But i'm not, so you do it.

885
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:05,760
OK.

886
00:55:06,769 --> 00:55:08,100
What?

887
00:55:08,771 --> 00:55:11,604
That was beautiful.

888
00:55:12,274 --> 00:55:15,107
Anyways, where were we?

889
00:55:15,611 --> 00:55:16,942
I'm "huge"?

890
00:55:18,781 --> 00:55:20,408
Surprised to see me, Makunga?

891
00:55:20,482 --> 00:55:23,713
Well, i'm here to set things straight,
like a real lion!

892
00:55:23,786 --> 00:55:28,120
Is this real enough for you? How
about this? This is for setting me up!

893
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:32,183
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!

894
00:55:32,261 --> 00:55:34,729
And making me look like a fool!

895
00:55:51,814 --> 00:55:54,476
Had enough? Sure, fly away!

896
00:55:54,817 --> 00:55:56,148
Coward.

897
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:09,661
The water. It's gone.

898
00:56:09,998 --> 00:56:11,829
It's never gone dry before.

899
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,767
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?

900
00:56:14,837 --> 00:56:18,102
Out of my way! What is going on here?!

901
00:56:18,173 --> 00:56:21,040
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!

902
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,442
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.

903
00:56:23,512 --> 00:56:25,002
Makunga, what do we do?

904
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,570
Quiet!

905
00:56:27,015 --> 00:56:32,009
Listen up! I'm afraid there is only
one solution to this horrible crisis:

906
00:56:33,021 --> 00:56:34,750
We’ll all have to fight for it.

907
00:56:34,823 --> 00:56:37,348
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.

908
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:40,351
That's not fair. You'd win!

909
00:56:40,529 --> 00:56:41,860
Exactly, Shirley.

910
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:43,019
I'm Bob...

911
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,932
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now,

912
00:56:47,202 --> 00:56:50,194
thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.

913
00:56:50,472 --> 00:56:53,999
Please, Makunga, this is
the only water on the reserve.

914
00:56:54,076 --> 00:56:58,035
If you're thirsty, you’ll have to look
for water off the reserve.

915
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,644
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!

916
00:57:00,749 --> 00:57:02,182
Hunters would shoot us!

917
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:04,151
No one leaves the reserve and survives!

918
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:06,050
I left the reserve!

919
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:08,216
And survived.

920
00:57:09,558 --> 00:57:11,492
I can do something about this.

921
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,894
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we
get in New York. I’ll travel upriver...

922
00:57:15,964 --> 00:57:18,091
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?

923
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:19,293
You?

924
00:57:20,235 --> 00:57:23,363
Yeah. I’ll unclog the pipe
and bring back your water.

925
00:57:23,439 --> 00:57:28,570
Great! I'd help you pack, but by the
looks of that hat, i see you're all set!

926
00:57:29,578 --> 00:57:34,242
Fine. Go ahead, laugh. Laugh
your mane off. I’ll prove you wrong.

927
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:37,410
Maybe you should try
a little rain dance.

928
00:57:43,325 --> 00:57:44,656
Zuba would know what to do.

929
00:57:44,927 --> 00:57:46,758
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.

930
00:57:46,995 --> 00:57:49,088
Zuba should be in charge, not you.

931
00:57:53,769 --> 00:57:55,327
all right, fine!

932
00:57:55,604 --> 00:57:59,096
As an added measure,
i will consuit with Zuba!

933
00:58:05,614 --> 00:58:06,945
Marty?

934
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:17,789
Hey! Marty!

935
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:24,121
Marty?

936
00:58:26,969 --> 00:58:28,561
Marty.

937
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:30,296
Where'd you get the fruity hat?

938
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:32,800
Excuse me! Excuse me!

939
00:58:33,141 --> 00:58:36,133
Hi. Is Marty in there?

940
00:58:36,812 --> 00:58:38,973
Anyone seen Marty?

941
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,150
Which one of us is Marty?

942
00:58:43,652 --> 00:58:46,314
all right. Well, if you see him,

943
00:58:46,388 --> 00:58:48,822
tell him his friend Alex
came to say goodbye.

944
00:58:48,891 --> 00:58:51,655
Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going?

945
00:58:51,727 --> 00:58:55,094
- Can we come?
- No. I have to do this alone.

946
00:58:55,163 --> 00:58:57,324
You can't leave the reserve!

947
00:59:08,744 --> 00:59:10,075
What are you doing?

948
00:59:10,345 --> 00:59:12,506
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!

949
00:59:13,515 --> 00:59:15,005
Could you leave the hat?

950
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,744
Marty! I know you're in there.

951
00:59:17,853 --> 00:59:20,845
Before i go, i got something
i want to say.

952
00:59:21,857 --> 00:59:24,121
You've been a great friend.

953
00:59:24,192 --> 00:59:27,684
You've helped me so often
to see the bright side of my problems...

954
00:59:27,763 --> 00:59:29,628
that i never think of you having any.

955
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:33,524
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

956
00:59:34,036 --> 00:59:35,867
Just like back at the zoo.

957
00:59:36,772 --> 00:59:41,038
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, i guess.

958
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:43,538
I just want you to know that i...

959
00:59:44,546 --> 00:59:46,377
You're one in a million.

960
00:59:46,882 --> 00:59:48,713
This is touching.

961
00:59:48,784 --> 00:59:50,217
It is touching.

962
00:59:50,552 --> 00:59:54,044
So could you turn around
so i can tell you to your face?

963
00:59:54,723 --> 00:59:56,714
That's right. Gotcha!

964
00:59:57,059 --> 00:59:59,653
I see you in there! Yeah, you.

965
00:59:59,728 --> 01:00:01,662
You, right there.

966
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:05,996
Twelfth row, two hundred
and third from the left.

967
01:00:06,068 --> 01:00:07,467
That's you, Marty.

968
01:00:07,903 --> 01:00:09,564
I know it's you.

969
01:00:11,406 --> 01:00:13,465
Know what makes you special?

970
01:00:13,809 --> 01:00:18,246
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.

971
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,141
You're a dreamer, Marty.

972
01:00:20,415 --> 01:00:24,078
always have been.
You have great taste in music...

973
01:00:24,419 --> 01:00:26,751
and horrible taste in friends.

974
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:30,252
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.

975
01:00:32,594 --> 01:00:34,027
OK, i'm in.

976
01:00:34,096 --> 01:00:36,428
Marty, you can't come with me.

977
01:00:36,498 --> 01:00:38,261
You don't have a choice.

978
01:00:43,105 --> 01:00:45,767
- People are out there!
- You're crazy! Come back!

979
01:00:46,108 --> 01:00:47,769
The people will get you!

980
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:50,169
Don't lose the hat!

981
01:00:51,046 --> 01:00:52,377
Bye, hat!

982
01:00:55,951 --> 01:00:57,043
Any water?

983
01:00:57,953 --> 01:01:00,786
No, just more diamonds and gold.

984
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:07,460
Don't give up hope.

985
01:01:07,529 --> 01:01:10,430
Listen up! I will help you!

986
01:01:10,499 --> 01:01:13,627
There's only one way
to get your precious water.

987
01:01:14,202 --> 01:01:16,966
I, your beloved King Julien...

988
01:01:17,472 --> 01:01:22,136
must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends, the water gods,

989
01:01:22,477 --> 01:01:25,310
in the volcano!

990
01:01:28,817 --> 01:01:29,977
What does that do?

991
01:01:30,218 --> 01:01:32,880
What does that do? Excellent question.

992
01:01:33,155 --> 01:01:36,249
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.

993
01:01:36,324 --> 01:01:40,317
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

994
01:01:40,662 --> 01:01:42,823
"Thank you for the sacrifice. "

995
01:01:42,898 --> 01:01:45,765
"Here, have another. "
"No, i've had enough. "

996
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:48,200
"I’ll be insulted
unless you have another. "

997
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:50,704
"I don't want another sacrifice!"

998
01:01:50,772 --> 01:01:53,832
"Look at you! You're skinny!"
"No! I've had enough!"

999
01:01:56,344 --> 01:01:59,438
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.

1000
01:01:59,548 --> 01:02:03,382
They give me some water,
and then i give it to you.

1001
01:02:03,418 --> 01:02:04,680
What?

1002
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,246
Does it work?

1003
01:02:06,688 --> 01:02:09,020
No! I mean, yes.

1004
01:02:09,524 --> 01:02:11,014
Well, Maurice?

1005
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,691
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.

1006
01:02:14,696 --> 01:02:16,527
We’ll do it!

1007
01:02:17,532 --> 01:02:18,863
Excellent!

1008
01:02:19,534 --> 01:02:23,402
Now all i need is someone
who would like to go into the volcano

1009
01:02:23,472 --> 01:02:25,463
and get eaten by gods.

1010
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:28,768
Any hands! Hands, anybody!

1011
01:02:28,844 --> 01:02:32,371
I need someone, perhaps
who has never found love,

1012
01:02:32,714 --> 01:02:37,617
who could look death straight
in the eyeball. A real, genuine hero.

1013
01:02:37,686 --> 01:02:39,711
- I’ll do it.
- Melman?

1014
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:52,894
Hurry up! Before we all
come to our senses!

1015
01:02:53,969 --> 01:02:55,960
Melman, what is wrong with you?

1016
01:02:56,238 --> 01:03:00,902
I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance
it'll get you water, it's worth it.

1017
01:03:01,243 --> 01:03:03,006
Are you nuts?

1018
01:03:03,078 --> 01:03:05,774
I want you to know, back at the zoo,

1019
01:03:05,847 --> 01:03:09,180
it was never the doctors
or prescriptions that kept me going.

1020
01:03:09,417 --> 01:03:11,510
It was always you.

1021
01:03:11,586 --> 01:03:14,020
Seeing you every day.

1022
01:03:14,089 --> 01:03:16,250
That's what kept me going.

1023
01:03:19,928 --> 01:03:21,919
Melman! Wait!

1024
01:03:22,998 --> 01:03:27,662
Melman! Melman! Melman!

1025
01:03:30,438 --> 01:03:32,929
You going to mope like this all day?

1026
01:03:33,775 --> 01:03:35,265
Don't "hmph" me.

1027
01:03:35,544 --> 01:03:39,207
Listen, Zuba. A miracle happened.

1028
01:03:39,281 --> 01:03:44,150
Our son came back to us. How come
that is not good enough for you?

1029
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:46,346
What are you saying, woman?

1030
01:03:47,289 --> 01:03:51,453
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.

1031
01:04:00,802 --> 01:04:02,133
Zuba!

1032
01:04:03,138 --> 01:04:04,799
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!

1033
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,701
What do you want?

1034
01:04:06,775 --> 01:04:07,969
It's awful.

1035
01:04:08,643 --> 01:04:10,372
The watering hole is dried up.

1036
01:04:10,445 --> 01:04:13,380
Dried up? That's impossible!

1037
01:04:13,448 --> 01:04:15,313
There's nothing left!

1038
01:04:15,383 --> 01:04:19,149
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?

1039
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:23,453
Your son, Alakay, he said he
could fix it. He's gone upriver.

1040
01:04:23,525 --> 01:04:25,117
- Off the reserve?!
- No!

1041
01:04:25,193 --> 01:04:27,923
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.

1042
01:04:27,996 --> 01:04:30,260
He was determined
to prove himself to you.

1043
01:04:31,499 --> 01:04:34,400
You stay here, in case he comes back!

1044
01:04:37,005 --> 01:04:38,666
Hurry, Zuba!

1045
01:04:41,943 --> 01:04:43,604
I'm so parched.

1046
01:04:49,184 --> 01:04:52,347
Is this place starting to freak you out?

1047
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:56,948
We’ll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.

1048
01:04:57,025 --> 01:04:58,754
Why are we doing this?

1049
01:04:59,027 --> 01:05:02,360
Maybe my dad will think i'm...

1050
01:05:02,864 --> 01:05:05,230
i want to show him i'm a real lion.

1051
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,463
As opposed to a chocolate lion.

1052
01:05:08,536 --> 01:05:13,974
I know this may sound hard to believe,
but apparently, lions don't dance.

1053
01:05:14,042 --> 01:05:15,202
What?!

1054
01:05:16,111 --> 01:05:17,976
As far as my dad is concerned.

1055
01:05:18,046 --> 01:05:20,640
As far as people are concerned,
you're a hit.

1056
01:05:20,882 --> 01:05:24,045
In New York. This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.

1057
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:26,110
Marty, this is it!

1058
01:05:27,222 --> 01:05:29,713
This is the clog! Come on.

1059
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:38,892
Well, there's the water.

1060
01:05:41,069 --> 01:05:43,560
Stay down. Look at that.

1061
01:05:43,905 --> 01:05:46,237
Knit one, purl two.

1062
01:05:46,308 --> 01:05:47,400
It's her.

1063
01:05:47,475 --> 01:05:49,170
- Is this right?
- Very good.

1064
01:05:49,244 --> 01:05:51,178
Nana, slow down.

1065
01:05:51,246 --> 01:05:54,010
You're a little tangled, aren't you?

1066
01:05:54,082 --> 01:05:56,414
No, don't pull. I’ll do it.

1067
01:05:57,352 --> 01:05:58,819
We need dynamite. Got any?

1068
01:05:59,087 --> 01:06:03,080
Oh, snap! I just used
my last stick this morning!

1069
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,089
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!

1070
01:06:07,362 --> 01:06:09,728
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!

1071
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:12,596
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!

1072
01:06:12,934 --> 01:06:15,266
No, no! Squiggly squid!

1073
01:06:15,603 --> 01:06:16,695
Etch A Sketch!

1074
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:19,930
That's too complex! Octopus, octopus!

1075
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:25,443
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!

1076
01:06:26,181 --> 01:06:29,514
Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go! Go! Squiggly squid!

1077
01:06:29,784 --> 01:06:32,719
Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch!

1078
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:37,049
Save us
We love you

1079
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,456
OK.

1080
01:06:38,793 --> 01:06:41,455
OK, OK, OK.

1081
01:06:48,403 --> 01:06:50,166
- Save us
- Melman

1082
01:06:50,238 --> 01:06:51,967
- We love you
- Melman

1083
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,029
Save us

1084
01:06:53,108 --> 01:06:55,542
OK, here we go. OK, OK.

1085
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,601
- Melman
- We love you

1086
01:06:57,679 --> 01:06:59,237
- Melman
- Save us

1087
01:06:59,347 --> 01:07:02,009
Here we go! Here we go!

1088
01:07:02,751 --> 01:07:05,083
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?

1089
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,811
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!

1090
01:07:08,089 --> 01:07:11,547
So did i. Then i realized
i'm covered in brown spots.

1091
01:07:11,826 --> 01:07:14,659
So Melman's not dying!

1092
01:07:15,163 --> 01:07:17,825
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!

1093
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:19,155
Melman!

1094
01:07:19,434 --> 01:07:20,765
Move!

1095
01:07:21,002 --> 01:07:24,768
Don't do this! Julien,
stop this! This is crazy!

1096
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:29,708
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe
into a volcano to make water is crazy!

1097
01:07:29,778 --> 01:07:30,767
Yes!

1098
01:07:33,348 --> 01:07:37,307
- Please, Melman! Stop!
- Gloria?

1099
01:07:37,385 --> 01:07:39,444
- You can't do this!
- Why not?

1100
01:07:39,687 --> 01:07:41,018
Because...

1101
01:08:00,275 --> 01:08:01,936
You can't do this, Melman.

1102
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:03,871
First, that hurts.

1103
01:08:04,145 --> 01:08:07,273
Second, i've only got
18 hours to live, anyway.

1104
01:08:07,348 --> 01:08:09,873
Melman, i gotta know...

1105
01:08:11,052 --> 01:08:13,543
...did you mean those things
you said about me?

1106
01:08:14,556 --> 01:08:15,955
Of course i did.

1107
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:18,384
- That's crazy.
- It is?

1108
01:08:21,062 --> 01:08:25,055
It's crazy to think i had to go
halfway around the world...

1109
01:08:25,633 --> 01:08:28,397
...to find out the perfect guy for me...

1110
01:08:28,736 --> 01:08:30,397
lived right next door.

1111
01:08:31,406 --> 01:08:33,738
Then it's you and me, neighbor.

1112
01:08:33,975 --> 01:08:36,637
You and me for the next 18 hours.

1113
01:08:36,911 --> 01:08:39,072
I’ll take whatever you got.

1114
01:08:43,418 --> 01:08:46,683
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.

1115
01:08:46,754 --> 01:08:49,587
- What's going on here?
- Marty!

1116
01:08:49,858 --> 01:08:53,589
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!

1117
01:08:53,862 --> 01:08:56,092
- What about the plane?
- Perfect! Come on!

1118
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:02,667
The plane won't be fixed
until the suits meet our demands.

1119
01:09:02,737 --> 01:09:04,432
Now, maternity leave.

1120
01:09:04,506 --> 01:09:07,998
Maternity leave? You're all males.

1121
01:09:08,076 --> 01:09:10,567
We need that plane for a rescue mission.

1122
01:09:10,645 --> 01:09:13,580
There's nothing i can do
until we bust up this union.

1123
01:09:13,648 --> 01:09:17,015
I’ll bust up all of you
if you don't get this plane going.

1124
01:09:17,085 --> 01:09:21,419
Can't you see these commies have
my hands tied? No maternity leave.

1125
01:09:23,992 --> 01:09:28,986
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want
these blowing around on the savanna.

1126
01:09:38,106 --> 01:09:40,768
all right. You get your maternity leave.

1127
01:09:42,177 --> 01:09:43,508
Finally.

1128
01:09:48,183 --> 01:09:51,448
Where we headed?
What's going on? Where are we going?

1129
01:09:51,519 --> 01:09:55,182
Oh, no! Please! Don't put me there! No!

1130
01:09:55,523 --> 01:09:57,184
This is wrong.

1131
01:09:57,258 --> 01:10:00,819
You see? You are survivors.

1132
01:10:00,895 --> 01:10:04,695
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

1133
01:10:05,133 --> 01:10:06,657
You can't eat a lion.

1134
01:10:06,734 --> 01:10:08,668
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.

1135
01:10:08,736 --> 01:10:11,034
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

1136
01:10:11,873 --> 01:10:14,034
She's out of her mind, people!

1137
01:10:16,177 --> 01:10:17,872
I'm from New York City!

1138
01:10:18,146 --> 01:10:20,614
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!

1139
01:10:28,223 --> 01:10:29,212
Dad!

1140
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:34,390
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!

1141
01:10:36,397 --> 01:10:38,228
Stay behind me.

1142
01:10:38,299 --> 01:10:41,496
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.

1143
01:10:41,736 --> 01:10:43,067
Stay back!

1144
01:10:43,404 --> 01:10:45,395
You'd let your dinner get away?

1145
01:10:51,746 --> 01:10:55,079
- What are you doing?
- The only thing i know how to do.

1146
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,309
What the heck?

1147
01:11:05,426 --> 01:11:07,758
Hey, i know those moves.

1148
01:11:08,196 --> 01:11:09,254
Alex?

1149
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:14,997
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!

1150
01:11:15,336 --> 01:11:16,701
It is Alex!

1151
01:11:16,771 --> 01:11:19,433
only one lion can move like that!

1152
01:11:24,779 --> 01:11:26,110
He's beautiful.

1153
01:11:26,347 --> 01:11:27,336
I can't believe it.

1154
01:11:34,122 --> 01:11:36,283
How does he do that?

1155
01:11:49,304 --> 01:11:50,362
What are you doing?

1156
01:11:50,638 --> 01:11:53,300
I'm dancing with my son! I think.

1157
01:11:53,641 --> 01:11:55,131
Don't think, Dad. feel!

1158
01:11:56,144 --> 01:11:57,805
Butterfly!

1159
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:02,312
I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

1160
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:16,153
Roar!

1161
01:12:26,174 --> 01:12:29,166
That was beautiful. Now let’s eat!

1162
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:30,738
Dad, look out!

1163
01:12:32,847 --> 01:12:34,007
What the...

1164
01:12:34,282 --> 01:12:35,840
Alex! Get in!

1165
01:12:36,084 --> 01:12:39,679
She's got a gun! Get out while we can!

1166
01:12:39,954 --> 01:12:41,546
- What?
- She's got a gun!

1167
01:12:41,689 --> 01:12:44,021
Get out while we can! Pass it on!

1168
01:12:47,695 --> 01:12:52,189
He said let’s have some fun
and take out the dam. Basset hound.

1169
01:12:52,433 --> 01:12:55,527
Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam.

1170
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:58,102
all right! But it's his funeral.

1171
01:12:59,207 --> 01:13:02,040
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!

1172
01:13:02,377 --> 01:13:04,868
Bring it on! Bring it on!

1173
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:13,551
Come back! That's my dinner!

1174
01:13:13,788 --> 01:13:15,449
Kowalski, full throttle.

1175
01:13:18,059 --> 01:13:19,048
Music!

1176
01:13:20,128 --> 01:13:22,653
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.

1177
01:13:22,897 --> 01:13:26,799
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about! Bring her in low!

1178
01:13:27,568 --> 01:13:31,060
hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!

1179
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,403
hold on tight, baby! Here we go!

1180
01:13:36,577 --> 01:13:39,239
tell them no! Pull up! They’ll kill us!

1181
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:42,472
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!

1182
01:13:45,686 --> 01:13:49,918
They say no pull up. kill us.
There's no other way. Basset hound.

1183
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:51,489
Are you sure?

1184
01:13:51,759 --> 01:13:56,253
Men, there is no sacrifice greater
than someone eise's.

1185
01:13:56,597 --> 01:13:57,928
No! Medic!

1186
01:14:02,603 --> 01:14:03,763
Ramming speed!

1187
01:14:08,509 --> 01:14:09,601
Bring it on!

1188
01:14:11,946 --> 01:14:13,777
Bad kitties.

1189
01:14:21,456 --> 01:14:24,448
I don't know
why the sacrifice didn't work.

1190
01:14:24,792 --> 01:14:27,124
The science seemed so solid.

1191
01:14:27,528 --> 01:14:32,295
I'd jump right in that volcano
if i wasn't so good at whistling.

1192
01:14:41,976 --> 01:14:43,967
It's you! I found you!

1193
01:14:44,212 --> 01:14:45,201
Mort?

1194
01:14:47,982 --> 01:14:49,643
Bad fishy!

1195
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:01,560
I wonder if the gods like seafood.

1196
01:15:01,896 --> 01:15:03,488
Let's find out.

1197
01:15:04,999 --> 01:15:06,330
Look, Maurice.

1198
01:15:08,769 --> 01:15:10,498
- That was quick.
- I did it!

1199
01:15:10,838 --> 01:15:13,329
I did it! I did it!

1200
01:15:14,675 --> 01:15:15,664
OK, you did it!

1201
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:17,673
Oh, yes!

1202
01:15:43,804 --> 01:15:44,793
Look!

1203
01:15:45,373 --> 01:15:47,204
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!

1204
01:15:48,376 --> 01:15:49,707
You did it!

1205
01:15:50,211 --> 01:15:52,202
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

1206
01:15:58,553 --> 01:16:00,544
Zuba! Alakay!

1207
01:16:01,155 --> 01:16:02,144
You're back!

1208
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:05,949
I'm so glad you're safe!

1209
01:16:06,894 --> 01:16:08,555
Out of my way.

1210
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:11,562
Well, well, well.

1211
01:16:12,567 --> 01:16:17,061
You know, Zuba, if i remember correctly,
you quit the pride.

1212
01:16:17,405 --> 01:16:19,236
And you were kicked out.

1213
01:16:19,507 --> 01:16:23,238
So don't think that this
changes anything.

1214
01:16:23,511 --> 01:16:28,312
You're right. In fact, we humbly present
you with this token of appreciation.

1215
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:30,847
A man bag. Very popular where i'm from.

1216
01:16:30,918 --> 01:16:33,284
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.

1217
01:16:33,354 --> 01:16:38,519
Does the strap adjust? This will go
very nicely for me when i go out hiking.

1218
01:16:38,759 --> 01:16:40,750
But you're still banished.

1219
01:16:40,995 --> 01:16:42,758
We figured you'd say that.

1220
01:16:44,932 --> 01:16:47,093
My handbag!

1221
01:16:47,868 --> 01:16:49,335
You bad kitty!

1222
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,798
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1223
01:17:05,353 --> 01:17:07,344
You deserve this, son.

1224
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:10,617
Welcome to the pride.

1225
01:17:15,229 --> 01:17:18,130
Thanks, Dad. But this belongs to you.

1226
01:17:18,466 --> 01:17:20,957
No, son. To us!

1227
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:30,304
My son! The King of New York!

1228
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:33,970
That's my baby!

1229
01:17:41,322 --> 01:17:44,314
Love transcends all differences.

1230
01:17:44,992 --> 01:17:49,326
We are gathered here today
to celebrate such a love.

1231
01:17:50,164 --> 01:17:53,497
Do you take each other,
for better or for worse?

1232
01:17:57,071 --> 01:17:58,265
For better, please.

1233
01:17:59,674 --> 01:18:02,165
What a beautiful, weird couple!

1234
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:04,341
That's not going to last.

1235
01:18:05,513 --> 01:18:07,413
Can i kiss the bride?

1236
01:18:07,748 --> 01:18:09,340
No! Music!

1237
01:18:10,084 --> 01:18:11,176
- Struts.
- Check.

1238
01:18:11,519 --> 01:18:12,508
- Flaps!
- Check.

1239
01:18:12,753 --> 01:18:14,516
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.

1240
01:18:17,024 --> 01:18:18,685
- Bye-bye!
- We’ll miss you!

1241
01:18:18,759 --> 01:18:19,953
See you later!

1242
01:18:20,027 --> 01:18:22,962
We’ll be back after the honeymoon
in Monte Carlo,

1243
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:24,861
or whenever the gold runs out.

1244
01:18:25,099 --> 01:18:26,293
Come back soon!

1245
01:18:26,434 --> 01:18:31,462
Mom, let them take their time. New York
isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

1246
01:18:31,539 --> 01:18:33,564
You're right about that!

1247
01:18:33,641 --> 01:18:35,575
As long as i'm with her...

1248
01:18:35,643 --> 01:18:39,443
...and you two, i don't care
where we are.

1249
01:18:39,714 --> 01:18:42,205
She has the most amazing laugh.

1250
01:18:45,052 --> 01:18:47,384
Love has no boundaries!

1251
01:18:48,322 --> 01:18:50,654
Looks like you're stuck
with us for a while.

1252
01:18:53,728 --> 01:18:56,162
Dad? What's wrong?

1253
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:58,892
I just thought we
could hang out a bit and...

1254
01:19:01,335 --> 01:19:03,462
- You got me!
- I got you, son!

1255
01:19:03,738 --> 01:19:07,139
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.

1256
01:19:10,077 --> 01:19:11,738
I got you, son!

1257
01:19:12,346 --> 01:19:14,678
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?

1258
01:19:14,749 --> 01:19:17,183
- Marty? Who's Marty?
- Come on.

1259
01:19:17,251 --> 01:19:20,516
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.

1260
01:19:20,588 --> 01:19:22,783
Ain't no Marty here.

1261
01:19:22,857 --> 01:19:27,294
Marty! I can look into your eyes,
and i know it's you.

1262
01:19:27,361 --> 01:19:30,626
See, i've been traveling
Been traveling forever

1263
01:19:30,698 --> 01:19:33,963
But now that i found a home
feels like i'm in heaven

1264
01:19:34,034 --> 01:19:37,299
