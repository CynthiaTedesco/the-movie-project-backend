1
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,313
If you have a fever and cough
or sore throat...

2
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,940
stay home.

3
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:09,152
I'd say 95% chance this is manufactured.
Came out of a laboratory.

4
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,028
The source of the virus was traced back...

5
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,490
to drug testing done at
Gen-Sys Laboratories in San Francisco.

6
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,868
The lab technician now known
as Patient Zero...

7
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,788
was accidentally exposed to
retrovirus ALZ-113...

8
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,666
an Alzheimer's trial drug
that was being tested on chimpanzees.

9
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:27,003
The infected chimps showed signs
of erratic and aggressive behavior...

10
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,963
that led to their escape from the facility.

11
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,340
The now-famous incident
on the Golden Gate Bridge...

12
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,384
a six-hour standoff with police...

13
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,053
ended with the apes disappearing
into Muir woods.

14
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,807
Emergency rooms are being overwhelmed
with patients showing signs...

15
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,726
of what's being dubbed
"The Simian Flu."

16
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:44,061
The CDC is projecting a fatality toll...

17
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,565
ranging from 5 million
to as many as 150 million...

18
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:48,983
in the next 6 to 8 months.

19
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,484
Anyone showing signs of
a contagious illness

20
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:53,529
will receive special
treatment here...

21
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,157
the airport's purpose-built
quarantine center.

22
00:01:56,325 --> 00:02:00,244
Many of the new arrivals are children
who have lost contact with their parents.

23
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,872
The mandatory quarantines
have sparked civil unrest.

24
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,916
Families are being ripped apart.

25
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,584
Containment is not very likely.

26
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,378
Prepare your families.
Know your evacuation route.

27
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,924
The survival rate is now
approximately 1 in 500.

28
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,176
Violence erupted in the
city center tonight.

29
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,744
The third incident in as many days.

30
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,222
Martial law has been
declared in 28 nations...

31
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,098
including the U.S. and Canada.

32
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,768
The reactor is overheating.
We can't stop a meltdown.

33
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,773
Just a total collapse of anything
resembling civilian order.

34
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,400
Due to the extremity of the
Simian Flu crisis...

35
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,279
all regular government functions
have been suspended indefinitely.

36
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,451
Those who aren't killed by the virus...

37
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,453
will probably die in the fighting.

38
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,707
So, maybe this is it.

39
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,918
This is how it ends.

40
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,586
Pretty soon...

41
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,756
there won't be anyone left.

42
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,531
Caesar...

43
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,199
They are close.

44
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,746
Koba!

45
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,851
Now, father?

46
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,917
Son, stay...

47
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,996
Thank you, Koba.

48
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,687
Think before you act, son.

49
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,296
Don't feel bad, Blue Eyes...

50
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,760
Scars make you strong.

51
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,859
Come meet your new brother.

52
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,251
Another son.

53
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,926
Makes me think how far we've come,
Maurice.

54
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:24,933
Seems long ago.

55
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,148
Still think about them?

56
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,609
Humans?

57
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,030
Sometimes.

58
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,786
Didn't know them like you did.

59
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,374
Only saw their bad side.

60
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:53,128
Good, bad... doesn't matter now.

61
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,965
Humans destroyed each other.

62
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,843
Apes fight too.

63
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,805
But we are family.

64
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:12,898
Wonder if they're really all gone.

65
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,359
Ten winters now...

66
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,154
Last two... no sign of them.

67
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,157
They must be gone.

68
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,900
That bear wouldn't get me Blue Eyes.
I'm quick!

69
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,111
Shut up, Ash!

70
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,582
Oh, God.

71
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,459
It's okay.

72
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,181
It's okay. It's okay.

73
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,724
Freeze!

74
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
Stay!

75
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:48,327
Help!

76
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,495
No!

77
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,830
Hey!

78
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,416
Over here!

79
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,254
I shot him! I shot him.

80
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,956
They shot Ash! Shot my son!

81
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,125
Rocket, wait...

82
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,092
We don't mean any harm!

83
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,137
They're apes, man. You think
they understand what you're saying?

84
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,140
Do they look like just apes to you?

85
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,822
Dad.

86
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,656
Malcolm, what are you doing?

87
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,074
- Dad?
- Malcolm.

88
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,325
It's okay.

89
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,332
Put your guns down.

90
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,334
- You can't be serious.
- Do it.

91
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,178
Go!

92
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,266
Holy shit.

93
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,354
Okay. Okay, we're going.

94
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,856
Go!

95
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,649
Slowly. Go, go, go!

96
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,113
My bag!

97
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,281
Go!

98
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,136
Koba!

99
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,306
Follow!

100
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,311
Did you find it?

101
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,772
We need to talk.

102
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,817
What? What's wrong?

103
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,112
The dam is pretty much intact.

104
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,197
It could probably start generating
power for us within a week.

105
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,783
But there is a problem. Get in.

106
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,546
I shot him.

107
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,692
I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.

108
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,718
Jesus Christ.
How many were there?

109
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,969
A lot. Like, 80.

110
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,303
- At least.
- Okay...

111
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,224
you're not hearing what he's saying.
They spoke!

112
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,809
That is not possible.

113
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,853
I'm telling you, Dreyfus,
they did and it was incredible.

114
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,731
Incredible? They're talking apes!

115
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,899
- With big-ass spears!
- Please!

116
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,862
I don't know exactly what you think
you saw or heard...

117
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,531
but you have to calm down, okay?

118
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,826
What about the virus, Ellie?
Any chance of contagion?

119
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,163
We're all genetically immune
or we would've been dead a long time ago.

120
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,539
You don't know that for sure.

121
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,067
She worked with the CDC.
She knows.

122
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,167
What are we gonna do?

123
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,835
I don't know.

124
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,879
We need that power.

125
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,006
He could've killed us, but he didn't.

126
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,717
Maybe he kept us alive,
so they could follow us.

127
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,845
They find out where we are,
and they kill us all!

128
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,305
What do you mean, "he"?

129
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,015
That's what we're trying to tell you.

130
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:23,018
It was unlike anything you've
ever seen before, and the leader...

131
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,645
He was remarkable.

132
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:26,897
Really?

133
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,155
- Is that what you thought?
- It's what we saw.

134
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,358
Yeah, it's what we all saw.

135
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,819
Not a word of this back at the colony,
you understand me?

136
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,787
Not a word
until we can figure out what to do.

137
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,407
- You gotta be kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.

138
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,911
I don't want to create a panic.

139
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,389
How are you doing, pal?
Are you okay?

140
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,558
- I dropped my bag.
- I know.

141
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,727
- Was your sketchbook in there?
- It's gone.

142
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,105
Carver just told me we're not gonna tell
anybody what happened up there.

143
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,941
Not yet. No.

144
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,928
Must attack them now!

145
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,138
Before they attack us!

146
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,850
We don't know how many there are.

147
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,352
How many guns they have?

148
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,439
Or why they came up here?

149
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,366
They shot your son, Rocket!

150
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,326
Don't you want to fight?

151
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,330
I follow Caesar.

152
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,876
Koba's right!

153
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,838
They almost killed you, Ash!

154
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,261
No!

155
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,810
If we go to war...

156
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,647
We could lose all we've built...

157
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,401
Home.

158
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,989
Family.

159
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,624
Future.

160
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,216
I will decide by morning.

161
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,812
Caesar.

162
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,280
For years I was a prisoner in their lab...

163
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,700
They cut me... Tortured me.

164
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,704
You freed me.

165
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,042
I would do anything you ask.

166
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,880
But we must show strength!

167
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,885
We will, Koba.

168
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:28,888
Coming through. Coming through.

169
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:52,287
That's a hell of a lot more than eighty!

170
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,150
Malcolm!

171
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,724
Apes...

172
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,688
do not want war...

173
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:04,692
but will fight...

174
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,822
if we must.

175
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,606
Ape home.

176
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:49,404
Human home.

177
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:57,203
Do not come back.

178
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,453
Everyone!

179
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,124
Everyone, you have to calm down!

180
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,799
Everybody.

181
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,469
Everybody!

182
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:58,306
Please! We're all immune!

183
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:02,852
We're all immune,
or we wouldn't still be here!

184
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,479
How did they find us?

185
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:06,981
We found them.

186
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,484
- You knew they were out there!
- What if they come back?

187
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,444
Yeah!

188
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:14,280
If they come back...
If they come back...

189
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:17,492
they'll be sorry they ever did!

190
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,620
Now, this city may not have the
manpower it once did...

191
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,665
but it has the firepower.

192
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,292
Those stockpiles left behind...

193
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,047
by FEMA, the National Guard,
we have it all.

194
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,007
Look...

195
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,011
I know why you're scared.

196
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:41,516
I'm scared, too, believe me.

197
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,395
But I recognize the trust
you've all placed in me.

198
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,856
We've been through hell together.

199
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:54,362
But you all know
what we're up against.

200
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:00,118
We're almost out of fuel.

201
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,371
Which means no more power...

202
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,041
which means we could slip back
to the way things were.

203
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:11,212
That dam up there was the answer.

204
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,300
We just had no idea
they were up there, too.

205
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,467
So, what do we do now?

206
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,720
Yeah!

207
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,723
We find another way...

208
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,560
because that power...

209
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,395
is not just about keeping the lights on.

210
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,106
It's about giving us the tools...

211
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,608
to reconnect to the rest of the world.

212
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,653
To find out who else is out there...

213
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:40,074
so that we can start to rebuild...

214
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,828
and reclaim...

215
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,500
the world we lost.

216
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,798
That was a great speech.

217
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,845
There is no alternative power source.

218
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,974
That dam is the only option.

219
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,357
Well, then, we fight them.

220
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,321
We're two weeks away
from running out of fuel.

221
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:19,530
Maybe three, tops.

222
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,782
I know.

223
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,117
And once that happens...

224
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,870
I won't be able to go out
there with a bullhorn...

225
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,331
and calm everybody down.

226
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,794
We need that power
to get the radio transmitter working.

227
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,381
It's our only chance
of reaching the outside world.

228
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,508
We have to find other survivors.

229
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,677
Yeah. There's not that many of us left.

230
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,472
We can't afford any more casualties.

231
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,308
We founded this place...

232
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,811
- you and I...
- I know.

233
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:53,981
On the idea that power would lead us back
to the life we once had.

234
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,734
If we can't stick together,
maybe we can't survive.

235
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,320
I lost everything.

236
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:04,826
The idea of losing what little I have is...

237
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,996
I want to go back up there.

238
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,876
Listen to me. Give me three days.

239
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,045
Let me talk to him.
If it doesn't work, then we do it your way.

240
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,506
And what if it backfires?
What if he gets violent?

241
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:22,385
I mean, how do you know
that he'll even understand you?

242
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,433
He's more than just an ape.

243
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,854
I'm gonna take some men
up to Fort Point.

244
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,897
I'm gonna go through the armory.

245
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,733
I'm gonna see what's still working.

246
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,278
Three days.

247
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:41,726
You're not back in three days...

248
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:45,366
we're going up there, and we're
gonna kill every last one of them.

249
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,010
Carver is getting the trucks ready.

250
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,888
He'll be here with Foster and Kemp
any minute.

251
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,516
You're really taking Carver?
I mean, he shot one of them.

252
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:11,934
I don't really have any choice.

253
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,618
He used to work at the
water department. He's

254
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,939
the only one who knows
how the dam works.

255
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,901
Malcolm...

256
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:23,654
what are you gonna do up there?
What are you gonna say?

257
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,825
I'll tell him the truth.

258
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,828
Hope I catch him in a good mood.

259
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,044
You think I'm crazy.

260
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,880
I'm worried.

261
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:43,799
Yeah, so am I.

262
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,261
I've gone over it in my head...

263
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:51,599
and I think if I don't at least try this...

264
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,977
there's gonna be a war.

265
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,417
Take me with you.

266
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,795
What if someone gets hurt?
You'll need me there.

267
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,300
I love you.

268
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,595
But I need you to stay here.

269
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,932
I don't want Alexander to be alone.

270
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,351
I'm coming, too.

271
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:40,314
Son, it's not safe.

272
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:43,693
But I'm safer with you
than I am down here.

273
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,362
I'm coming.

274
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,822
Please.

275
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,477
No one gets out of the trucks.

276
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,396
No one.

277
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:24,358
If I'm not back in two hours,
you get everyone back to the city.

278
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,111
It's gonna be okay.

279
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,296
Please. Please. Please.

280
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,218
Please don't kill me.

281
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,721
Just hear what I have to say.

282
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,098
I know.

283
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:48,103
"Don't come back." I know.

284
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,314
I wouldn't be here unless it were...

285
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,274
Okay! Okay! Okay!

286
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:59,114
Okay, okay, okay.

287
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,410
I need to show you something.

288
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,662
It's not far.

289
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,247
Human lies!

290
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,749
No! No!

291
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:13,045
No, no, no. I swear.

292
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,926
If I could just show you,
then you'll understand.

293
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,636
Please.

294
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,576
Show me.

295
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:10,394
This is what we used to call
a "small hydro."

296
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,314
It was built to service
areas to the north of here...

297
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,650
but we've been working to
reroute the power lines to the city...

298
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:19,403
because the city used to run off nuclear
power, but that ran out years ago.

299
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,989
So, we've been using
diesel generators and gasifiers.

300
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:24,909
But if we can just
get this dam working...

301
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:29,371
then we have a shot
at restoring limited power.

302
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,423
Is any of this making any sense to you?

303
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,427
The... lights.

304
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,346
Yes.

305
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:47,514
The lights.

306
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,392
This is your home...

307
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,228
and I don't want to take it away from you,
I promise.

308
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:57,983
But if you can let us do our work here...

309
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,027
You brought others?

310
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:05,741
Just a few.

311
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,535
I'm not a threat.

312
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,162
If I am...

313
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,582
then I guess you can kill me.

314
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,901
Come on!

315
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:45,072
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Stop, stop.

316
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,752
We need to give them our guns.

317
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,923
That's the one condition.

318
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:04,591
What does that mean?

319
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,386
We can stay.

320
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,320
If they get power, they'll
be more dangerous!

321
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,322
Why help them?!

322
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,658
They seem desperate...

323
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:33,120
If we make them go, they'll attack.

324
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,414
Let them.

325
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:39,001
We'll destroy them while they're weak.

326
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:43,047
And how many apes will die?

327
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,635
We have one chance for peace...

328
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,181
Let them do their human work.
Then they'll go.

329
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,310
Human work?

330
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:06,987
Human work.

331
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,281
Human work!

332
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,029
Koba say...

333
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,533
Apes should hate humans...
Enough!

334
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,035
From humans Koba learned hate...

335
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,995
But nothing else.

336
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,511
Hey.

337
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:14,012
You need to eat.

338
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:16,723
Okay.

339
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,059
That was brave, what you did today.

340
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,944
Malcolm.

341
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,779
I know everyone's depending on you...

342
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:34,616
I don't care about that.
I don't care about any of that.

343
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:36,785
I care about him.

344
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:42,958
He saw things that no kid should see,
and I'm not letting us go back to that.

345
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,590
I know.

346
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,977
I have been trying
to get closer to him.

347
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,062
But...

348
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,148
You will.

349
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,906
You know the scary thing about them?

350
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:17,326
They don't need power, lights.

351
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:21,038
Heat. Nothing.

352
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:21,914
Hey, pal.

353
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,624
That's their advantage.

354
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:27,085
That's what makes them stronger.

355
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,922
Malcolm, I'm thinking one of us
should stand guard tonight.

356
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,174
With what? They took our guns.

357
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:33,717
If they wanted us dead,
we would be dead already.

358
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,178
Maybe they're just taking their time.

359
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,946
They killed off half the planet already.

360
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:39,348
Come on.

361
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:40,349
What?

362
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,142
You can't honestly blame the apes.

363
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,938
Who the hell else am I going to blame?
It was the Simian Flu.

364
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,905
It was a virus created
by scientists in a lab.

365
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:50,651
The chimps they were testing on
didn't have a say in the matter.

366
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,527
Spare me the hippie-dippie bullshit.

367
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,864
You're telling me you don't get
sick to your stomach at the sight of them?

368
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,328
Didn't you have a little girl?

369
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:02,496
Carver, that's enough.

370
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,206
- How did she die?
- That's enough!

371
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:05,249
Or your wife, for that matter.

372
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,576
Carver, you better shut up...

373
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:08,585
before I kick your ass.

374
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,173
Okay.

375
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,595
I'm the asshole.

376
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,394
Are you okay?

377
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:48,125
You sound sick... You OK?

378
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,212
Just need rest.

379
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,889
You worry about the humans...

380
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,868
Where's Koba?

381
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,789
Still angry.

382
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:13,460
Said he was going hunting...

383
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,136
Look, humans below!

384
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:37,984
Why are we here?

385
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:41,196
Caesar trusts humans...

386
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,824
Koba does not.

387
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:47,202
Most of the arsenal seems functional.

388
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,161
Good.

389
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,996
We're testing them out back.

390
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:38,879
Hey!

391
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,131
Don't you move!

392
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:44,301
Don't move, do you understand me?

393
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,553
Terry!

394
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,389
Terry, get in here, quick!

395
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,148
Holy shit.

396
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,695
What do we do? What do we do?

397
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:05,280
Where did he come from?

398
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:08,575
- Should we shoot him?
- Maybe. I don't know.

399
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:15,081
You are one ugly son of a bitch,
aren't you?

400
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:36,061
Whoa, man.

401
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,108
Dude, I think he's hungry.

402
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,611
He must have gotten separated
from the others.

403
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:45,862
You lost?

404
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,949
Trying to get home?

405
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:52,452
Go on! Get out of here, stupid monkey!

406
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,372
Go on. You heard him. Go!

407
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,715
Enough guns here to kill every ape...

408
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,218
Must warn Caesar.

409
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,512
Who knows what humans are
really doing up there?

410
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,784
We gotta clear this blockage.

411
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,666
I didn't know you had a daughter.

412
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,339
Yeah.

413
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,138
What was her name?

414
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,186
Sarah.

415
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,526
I'm really sorry.

416
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:17,495
Well, now I have you and your dad, so...

417
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:26,296
Yeah.

418
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,381
All right, you got that straight?

419
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,060
Whoa.

420
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,187
That's all the wire we got.

421
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,023
Brace yourselves.

422
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:50,320
Three, two, one.

423
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,328
- Dad!
- Malcolm!

424
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,669
Malcolm! Malcolm!

425
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:06,836
Dad?

426
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,672
I can't see Carver.

427
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,738
Don't!

428
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,907
- Leave it there.
- I got it.

429
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,412
It's not broken.

430
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:44,332
Let go. Good.

431
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,804
Thank you.

432
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,807
You saved our lives.

433
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:02,767
We've got a lot of debris to clear now.

434
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,135
We might need a bit more time.

435
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:05,979
How long?

436
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,435
Hey, buddy.

437
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,860
Hey... hey...

438
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,613
What are you doing? Are you finished?

439
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,575
What are you looking at?

440
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,752
Hey! Hey!

441
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,588
Hey, get out of there!

442
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,179
- Hey! I'll kill you!
- Carver, what're you doing?

443
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,143
Don't! Don't!

444
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,020
Caesar, no!

445
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:30,396
No.

446
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:49,457
Said no guns!

447
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,629
- No, don't.
- Please.

448
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,329
I didn't know.

449
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:38,798
Human leave now!

450
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,261
Man, we screwed now.

451
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,266
Malcolm?

452
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:33,019
Malcolm, where are you going?

453
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:34,187
Malcolm.

454
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:43,071
Please, please,
I just need to speak to him.

455
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:49,369
I'm sorry. That was all my fault.
But I will make him leave.

456
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,622
This my home.

457
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,042
You should not be here.

458
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,752
I understand.

459
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,921
Malcolm.

460
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,052
She's sick.

461
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,306
How long has she been this way?

462
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,066
I have medicine.

463
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:22,986
Antibiotics.

464
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,406
Maybe she can help.

465
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:32,662
Do not trust you.

466
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:37,000
I don't blame you.

467
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:41,587
But believe me... we
are not all like him.

468
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,256
Please.

469
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,926
Let us help you.

470
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,290
One day.

471
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,670
You stay one day.

472
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,964
Father, no...!

473
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:27,675
- We might need more time.
- One day!

474
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,140
Ape will help.

475
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:40,730
I will not help!

476
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:46,033
- This is bullshit, man!
- Get him out of here.

477
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,821
Move! That's enough.
Come on, get out of here.

478
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,740
Come on, man.

479
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,997
Okay?

480
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,876
Move, come on!

481
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:08,049
Get in!

482
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:25,149
See you tomorrow, asshole.

483
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:33,116
Just came from the city.
Humans very dangerous!

484
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,535
Where is Caesar?

485
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,208
With the humans...

486
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:48,881
Yo, Alex.

487
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:52,135
This relay's busted.
See if there's another one.

488
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,302
Yeah.

489
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:16,659
Caesar.

490
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:23,374
Hey!

491
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,712
No! No, no, no, don't!

492
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,380
No! No! No!

493
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:40,016
Where Caesar? Want Caesar.

494
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,143
Caesar!

495
00:58:58,327 --> 00:59:02,496
Humans attack your sons.

496
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:06,584
You let them stay!

497
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,714
Put apes in danger!

498
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:19,347
Caesar love humans more...
than apes!

499
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:26,145
More than your... sons.

500
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:14,652
Ape...

501
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:21,033
not... kill... ape.

502
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,397
Forgive me.

503
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:27,767
You are my son...

504
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,687
I need you to listen...

505
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:47,453
You didn't tell Caesar
about the guns we found?

506
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,792
Neither will you.

507
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:08,599
Your father doesn't trust me now.

508
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,561
You need to protect him.

509
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:15,648
His love for humans...

510
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,067
Makes him blind.

511
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,985
I know...

512
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:24,865
As long as they are here...

513
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:30,746
I fear for Caesar's life.

514
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:22,214
For yesterday.

515
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,991
Look. Look.

516
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:52,328
Watch.

517
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,246
"It was Friday.

518
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,374
"A real nice afternoon."

519
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,585
"Warm."

520
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:05,049
"We were hanging..."

521
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:08,177
"We were hanging out..."

522
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:11,096
"at this kegger down
at the swimming hole."

523
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,017
Hanging out.

524
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:19,438
Hanging.

525
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,901
Here. You can read?

526
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,121
Now, this is the good stuff.

527
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,751
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

528
01:04:47,259 --> 01:04:51,262
What the hell is wrong with you?
I thought we told you to go home!

529
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:53,180
No!

530
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:55,891
No! Go!

531
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:00,789
- He understood that, didn't he?
- Yeah.

532
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:03,816
Hey, hey, hey!

533
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:05,484
Hey, hey.

534
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:10,739
Hey.

535
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,909
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey.

536
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:17,997
I think he likes you.

537
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,582
Shut up.

538
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,500
All right, all right.

539
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:25,379
You want a drink, fugly?

540
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:27,631
Go on, give him some.

541
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:30,217
Give him some, man.
See what happens.

542
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:33,971
There you go.

543
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:35,889
Whoa, hey!

544
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:39,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

545
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:42,146
Shit!

546
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,193
That's good, huh?

547
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:51,864
Hey, hey, hey!

548
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,741
Okay. All right.

549
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:55,826
Easy.

550
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:56,702
Yeah.

551
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:57,995
- Easy.
- Easy.

552
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,163
All right...

553
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,964
Malcolm!

554
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,676
What is it? What happened?

555
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,733
It worked.

556
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,694
At least here it did.

557
01:08:35,904 --> 01:08:38,697
We'll know when
we get back to the city.

558
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:46,705
Trust.

559
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,399
Son of a bitch.

560
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:17,653
You son of a bitch!

561
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:06,159
The... lights.

562
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,816
Feeling better?

563
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:17,731
Mother...?

564
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:30,595
Human gun!

565
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,267
Run.

566
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:53,243
Humans kill Caesar!

567
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:59,916
Burn ape home!

568
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,805
Go! Get them!

569
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:17,934
Apes must attack human city!

570
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:20,771
Fight back!

571
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:24,941
Come, fight for Caesar!

572
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,906
Females and young stay in woods...

573
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,491
We go to the city!

574
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:44,336
We will avenge your father's death!

575
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,352
Ellie! Ellie.

576
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,963
This is San Francisco
attempting contact.

577
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,340
If anyone is receiving this message...

578
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:57,636
we ask that you identify yourself
and your location. Over.

579
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,650
Move, move!

580
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:29,834
If you are receiving this signal,
please state your location. Over.

581
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:33,880
Repeat. This is San Francisco
attempting to establish contact.

582
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:35,173
If you are receiving this signal...

583
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:38,051
please state your identity
and your location. Over.

584
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:40,637
What is it?

585
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:41,998
The apes attacked the armory, sir.

586
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:48,728
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!

587
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:26,766
Keep them off the walls!
Keep them off the walls!

588
01:17:30,438 --> 01:17:32,605
Let's go! Get into position.

589
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:38,194
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

590
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:39,696
Good.

591
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:42,032
Listen to me.

592
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:45,785
We are survivors!

593
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:48,246
Now, they may have got their hands
on some of our guns...

594
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:50,707
but that does not make them men.

595
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:53,209
They are animals!

596
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:54,461
We will push them back!

597
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:57,130
Drive them down!

598
01:17:57,298 --> 01:18:01,217
And they will not
get through these doors!

599
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,799
There! California Street!

600
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:30,408
Bring me the rocket launcher!

601
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:44,876
We have a beacon marking our location.

602
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:47,128
Please, we need help.
We are under attack.

603
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:48,880
San Francisco. Repeat.

604
01:22:49,048 --> 01:22:49,714
Hello?

605
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,215
Do you copy?

606
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:20,453
Humans escaping! Capture them!

607
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:44,977
We must be getting close.

608
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:53,361
I think I see it. It's down here!

609
01:23:57,324 --> 01:23:58,616
Dad!

610
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,218
Oh, my God. Malcolm!

611
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:18,803
Ellie, help me.

612
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,317
My...

613
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:35,319
son...

614
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:39,741
My...

615
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,118
family...

616
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:47,957
Where?

617
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:54,589
I don't know.

618
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:06,934
Try not to speak. You need to rest.

619
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,737
Hold.

620
01:25:28,582 --> 01:25:29,665
He's lost a lot of blood.

621
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,459
Is he going to make it?

622
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:33,544
I don't understand.

623
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:36,798
Where did Carver get the gun?

624
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:39,091
Why would he do this?

625
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:40,426
Ape...

626
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,180
What?

627
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:48,684
Ape...

628
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:50,770
did...

629
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,148
this.

630
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:03,366
Get in the truck.

631
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,472
Followed the humans here.
Hiding everywhere!

632
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:29,600
We must catch them all!

633
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:49,495
Kill him.

634
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:50,663
No, no, no.

635
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:58,462
Go ahead Ash...

636
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:01,674
make humans pay.

637
01:27:05,178 --> 01:27:08,472
Caesar wouldn't want this.

638
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:49,972
Caesar gone...

639
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:57,688
Apes follow...

640
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,858
Koba now.

641
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:24,298
Oh, my God.
Look, the colony's on fire.

642
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:26,384
Where are we going to go?

643
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,427
Caesar, what?

644
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:38,938
Is this it? Are we close?

645
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:40,564
Where is he taking us?

646
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:44,568
Malcolm, stop!

647
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:56,163
I don't understand.
What are we doing here?

648
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:57,331
It doesn't matter.

649
01:28:57,416 --> 01:29:00,376
We just need a place to hide him
until we find out what's going on at home.

650
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,507
Go move the table.

651
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:12,638
Okay. Right here.

652
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:14,765
Okay.

653
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:20,604
Dad, look.

654
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:23,649
Look.

655
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:31,699
We need to operate.
I don't have anything.

656
01:29:32,826 --> 01:29:34,452
There's a surgical kit
back at the place, but that's...

657
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:35,661
I'll go.

658
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:38,998
It's not safe.

659
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:42,001
He's the only one that can stop this.

660
01:29:44,463 --> 01:29:46,172
Humans!

661
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:50,092
You ape prisoner now!

662
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:54,096
You will know life in cage.

663
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:57,808
More humans out there.

664
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:01,103
Go! Find them!

665
01:30:20,457 --> 01:30:22,416
Maurice...?

666
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:25,086
Koba said...

667
01:30:25,796 --> 01:30:28,672
we're too loyal to your father.

668
01:30:31,218 --> 01:30:34,845
Protect yourself.

669
01:31:54,593 --> 01:31:55,676
Shit!

670
01:33:05,872 --> 01:33:07,414
Hey, wait.

671
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,292
Your father.

672
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,089
He's alive.

673
01:33:27,394 --> 01:33:28,394
I got it.

674
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:30,062
How is he?

675
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:57,756
Your... mother.

676
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:01,635
Brother.

677
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:04,138
Safe?

678
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:07,558
For now.

679
01:34:16,109 --> 01:34:18,694
No.

680
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:24,366
Not human.

681
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:30,205
Koba.

682
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:35,085
Malcolm.

683
01:34:35,795 --> 01:34:37,254
Yeah.

684
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:40,257
Caesar.

685
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:44,053
We need to do this now.

686
01:34:48,058 --> 01:34:49,558
Son.

687
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:26,011
How is he?

688
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:29,848
We'll see.

689
01:35:31,351 --> 01:35:33,352
He's very strong.

690
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:44,780
It's gonna be okay.

691
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:20,065
I'm so sorry...

692
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:22,568
For everything.

693
01:36:24,154 --> 01:36:25,654
No.

694
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:31,160
I...

695
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:32,870
am to blame.

696
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:37,541
But Koba betrayed you.

697
01:36:37,876 --> 01:36:42,963
I... chose to trust him...

698
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:47,718
because he is ape.

699
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:51,221
I always think...

700
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:55,684
ape better than human.

701
01:36:57,979 --> 01:37:00,063
I see now...

702
01:37:01,858 --> 01:37:06,236
how much like them we are.

703
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:13,076
Where Koba now?

704
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:17,289
On the human tower...

705
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:20,584
Loyal apes around him.

706
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:24,213
And those who not follow?

707
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:26,632
Prisoners.

708
01:37:27,967 --> 01:37:29,343
Maurice.

709
01:37:30,011 --> 01:37:31,428
Rocket.

710
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:37,976
Koba killed Ash.

711
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:46,485
Fear makes others follow.

712
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:50,781
But when they see you alive...

713
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:55,327
They will turn from Koba.

714
01:37:55,453 --> 01:37:57,246
Not if I am weak.

715
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:04,419
Ape always seek strongest branch.

716
01:38:07,549 --> 01:38:11,468
I must do something to stop him.

717
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,313
Father.

718
01:38:25,984 --> 01:38:29,945
Let me help you.

719
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:23,206
Please, let us out of here!

720
01:41:42,889 --> 01:41:43,889
Okay.

721
01:41:44,056 --> 01:41:45,932
Caesar, look.

722
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:49,853
Apple.

723
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:52,189
Good.

724
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:59,780
Home.

725
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:02,616
Yes.

726
01:42:04,535 --> 01:42:06,411
This is your home.

727
01:42:06,913 --> 01:42:08,371
Your home.

728
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:12,626
Good. Good.

729
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:15,212
That's good.

730
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:39,778
Sorry.

731
01:42:39,946 --> 01:42:42,072
I didn't mean to intrude.

732
01:42:46,077 --> 01:42:48,453
It's been two days.

733
01:42:54,544 --> 01:42:56,711
Your son is not back yet?

734
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:03,677
Who was that?

735
01:43:05,096 --> 01:43:06,721
On the video.

736
01:43:09,475 --> 01:43:12,811
A good man.

737
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:18,024
Like you.

738
01:43:48,848 --> 01:43:50,768
They need to get to the tower
without being seen.

739
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:52,809
I'm gonna take him through the subway.

740
01:43:53,603 --> 01:43:54,728
I love you.

741
01:43:55,313 --> 01:43:58,523
Koba sent for the females and young.

742
01:43:58,733 --> 01:44:01,276
They're on their way.

743
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:03,028
Mother too.

744
01:44:04,447 --> 01:44:06,698
Must go. Now!

745
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,169
Are you okay?

746
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:31,306
Who's there?

747
01:44:31,974 --> 01:44:34,225
If you're human, you better say so!

748
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:36,227
It's me! It's Malcolm!

749
01:44:36,395 --> 01:44:37,687
Don't shoot!

750
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:41,024
Take the stairs.

751
01:44:41,192 --> 01:44:43,352
They'll bring you around and
up under the street, okay?

752
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:44,527
Go.

753
01:44:48,616 --> 01:44:49,616
Thank you.

754
01:44:50,368 --> 01:44:52,202
Trust.

755
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:01,169
All right, I'm coming out!

756
01:45:01,337 --> 01:45:03,046
Don't shoot!

757
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:22,107
Hey!

758
01:45:22,274 --> 01:45:23,692
Look who I found.

759
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:25,944
I didn't know if you'd made it out.

760
01:45:26,112 --> 01:45:27,153
Good to see you.

761
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:28,738
Don't worry.

762
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:30,448
We're gonna turn all this around.

763
01:45:30,616 --> 01:45:32,409
What do you mean? What's going on?

764
01:45:32,576 --> 01:45:34,285
The apes. They're all over the tower.

765
01:45:34,453 --> 01:45:36,204
I lost the signal. It dropped out.

766
01:45:36,372 --> 01:45:37,372
Keep trying.

767
01:45:37,498 --> 01:45:38,999
Malcolm, look at this.

768
01:45:40,376 --> 01:45:43,628
C-4. Five-pound blocks.

769
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:46,381
We just started setting them.

770
01:45:46,549 --> 01:45:49,009
They're gonna take down the whole tower.

771
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:53,555
Blast them all at once.

772
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:56,057
We could use your help.

773
01:46:34,597 --> 01:46:37,849
This is San Francisco attempting contact.
If anyone is receiving this...

774
01:46:38,017 --> 01:46:41,102
we ask that you identify yourself and
your location. Over.

775
01:46:45,191 --> 01:46:46,983
Here. Come on.

776
01:46:47,151 --> 01:46:49,711
If anyone is receiving this,
we ask that you identify yourself...

777
01:46:49,862 --> 01:46:51,613
and your location. Over.

778
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:01,206
This is San Francisco...

779
01:47:01,373 --> 01:47:03,625
attempting contact.
If anyone is receiving this...

780
01:47:03,793 --> 01:47:06,669
we ask that you identify yourself
and your location.

781
01:47:09,215 --> 01:47:11,174
- Hey.
- Hey.

782
01:47:18,516 --> 01:47:21,309
If anyone is receiving this,
we ask that you identify yourself...

783
01:47:21,477 --> 01:47:22,769
and your location. Over.

784
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:28,566
Dreyfus.

785
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:34,239
- Can anybody hear me?
- Werner.

786
01:47:37,618 --> 01:47:40,537
I'm sorry, but I can't let you do this.

787
01:47:41,831 --> 01:47:43,665
We need to give him a chance.

788
01:47:44,667 --> 01:47:46,584
We need to give him some time.

789
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:49,003
He's up there right now.

790
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:53,424
Who's up there?

791
01:48:30,004 --> 01:48:35,800
Caesar has no place here.

792
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:39,804
Apes follow...

793
01:48:40,931 --> 01:48:42,599
Koba now.

794
01:48:46,187 --> 01:48:48,646
Follow Koba...

795
01:48:49,607 --> 01:48:50,648
to war.

796
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:53,526
Apes win war!

797
01:48:55,154 --> 01:48:58,448
Apes together strong!

798
01:49:03,621 --> 01:49:05,038
Caesar...

799
01:49:06,498 --> 01:49:07,832
weak.

800
01:49:11,629 --> 01:49:14,714
Koba weaker.

801
01:50:04,014 --> 01:50:06,599
Are you out of your fucking mind?

802
01:50:07,351 --> 01:50:10,353
No, I've seen things.
I've seen the way they are.

803
01:50:11,188 --> 01:50:13,064
They want what we want, to survive.

804
01:50:13,232 --> 01:50:14,357
They don't want a war.

805
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:16,025
They're animals!

806
01:50:16,193 --> 01:50:17,443
They attacked us!

807
01:50:17,611 --> 01:50:20,280
Because they thought we attacked them.
They think that he's dead, but he's not...

808
01:50:20,447 --> 01:50:22,031
Sit down, Finney!

809
01:50:22,783 --> 01:50:24,200
Sit down!

810
01:50:47,558 --> 01:50:49,642
Trusted Koba like brother.

811
01:50:49,977 --> 01:50:53,271
Caesar brother to human!

812
01:50:55,733 --> 01:50:58,401
Koba fight for ape!

813
01:50:58,736 --> 01:51:00,486
Free ape!

814
01:51:03,073 --> 01:51:04,324
Kill ape.

815
01:51:04,491 --> 01:51:06,075
Koba fight for Koba.

816
01:51:14,918 --> 01:51:16,252
Koba...

817
01:51:16,795 --> 01:51:20,506
belong in cage.

818
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:10,640
I know how this must sound.

819
01:52:10,808 --> 01:52:11,968
I don't think you have any...

820
01:52:17,523 --> 01:52:19,565
Do you think stopping me will matter?

821
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:21,818
They're coming.

822
01:52:22,986 --> 01:52:25,405
Now, we made contact with a
military base up north.

823
01:52:26,365 --> 01:52:28,908
They're already on their way!

824
01:52:29,701 --> 01:52:30,827
It's true.

825
01:52:35,749 --> 01:52:36,499
Dreyfus!

826
01:52:36,667 --> 01:52:38,167
What are you doing, man?

827
01:52:48,345 --> 01:52:50,179
I'm saving the human race.

828
01:52:50,347 --> 01:52:51,347
No!

829
01:55:12,656 --> 01:55:13,864
Ape...

830
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:16,659
not kill...

831
01:55:17,536 --> 01:55:18,828
ape.

832
01:55:44,354 --> 01:55:46,564
You are...

833
01:55:48,358 --> 01:55:50,192
not ape.

834
01:55:54,031 --> 01:55:55,615
No!

835
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:11,440
Leave him!

836
01:57:29,292 --> 01:57:31,001
You're not safe here.

837
01:57:31,628 --> 01:57:34,338
They made contact.
Other people are coming. Soldiers.

838
01:57:34,923 --> 01:57:36,966
You have to leave now. Everyone.

839
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:41,512
If you don't go,
it'll be all-out war.

840
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:45,599
War... has already...

841
01:57:46,685 --> 01:57:47,810
begun.

842
01:57:49,813 --> 01:57:52,565
Ape started war.

843
01:57:55,694 --> 01:57:57,403
And human...

844
01:57:59,823 --> 01:58:02,867
Human will not forgive.

845
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:09,832
You must go...

846
01:58:10,167 --> 01:58:13,878
before fighting begins.

847
01:58:15,714 --> 01:58:17,506
I am sorry...

848
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:22,928
my friend.
