1
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,171
See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,521
Oh, my God!

3
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,667
I'm in.

4
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,577
We're almost there.

5
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,711
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.

6
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,342
I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping
some serious sentinel activity up here.

7
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,920
- Link.
- Yes, sir?

8
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,210
Given your situation, I can't say
I understand your reasons...

9
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,050
...for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.

10
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:11,218
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

11
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,227
What's that, sir?

12
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,266
To trust me.

13
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,397
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

14
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,608
- I mean, I do, sir.
- I hope so.

15
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,149
Repatch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.

16
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,407
Yes, sir.

17
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,495
Still can't sleep?

18
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,831
You wanna talk?

19
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,544
They're just dreams.

20
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,257
If you're afraid of something...

21
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,266
I just wish...

22
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,179
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

23
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,188
That's all.

24
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,691
I just wish I knew.

25
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,105
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

26
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,318
Here you are.

27
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,950
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.

28
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,740
These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the <i>Osiris.</i>

29
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,162
The machines are digging.

30
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,124
They're boring from the surface
down to Zion.

31
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,881
- Mother...
- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.

32
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,541
How fast are they moving?

33
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,087
Control estimates their descent
at 100 meters an hour.

34
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,722
- How deep are they?
- Almost 2000 meters.

35
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,431
- What about the scans from the <i>Osiris</i>?
- They can't be accurate.

36
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,516
- They may be.
- It's not possible.

37
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,147
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels.

38
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,808
- That's right.
- That can't be.

39
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,647
Why not?

40
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,564
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

41
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,493
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.

42
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,824
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

43
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,493
Niobe.

44
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:01,244
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...

45
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,710
...it's become difficult to locate
a secure broadcast position.

46
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,126
- Squiddies got our best spots.
- Lines are crawling with them.

47
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:12,092
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

48
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,381
What are we gonna do?

49
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,845
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered.

50
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,769
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.

51
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:24,059
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

52
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,898
A strategy is still being formulated.

53
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,734
I'm sure it is.

54
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,747
What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?

55
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,083
- Proceed as ordered...
- What is it?

56
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,295
I don't know.

57
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,257
...however, I must
ask one of you for help.

58
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:58,142
Some of you believe as I believe, some
of you do not. Those of you that do...

59
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,849
...know we are nearing
the end of our struggle.

60
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:05,266
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...

61
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,777
...the Oracle must be consulted.

62
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,947
If we return and recharge now...

63
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,868
...we can be back in 36 hours, well
before the machines reach this depth.

64
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,918
Do you understand what you're asking?

65
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,922
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place...

66
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,799
...in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

67
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,087
Bullshit. You're asking one of us
to disobey a direct order.

68
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:38,804
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...

69
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,594
...is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

70
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,683
What happens when you
get back to Zion...

71
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,270
...and the commander
throws you in the stockade?

72
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,650
He won't.

73
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,987
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.

74
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,442
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

75
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,154
You got 36 hours.

76
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,788
I'm looking for Neo.

77
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,326
- Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.

78
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,754
A gift.

79
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,833
You see, he set me free.

80
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,504
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

81
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,093
Who was that?

82
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,098
How did you know someone was here?

83
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,725
He gave you this.

84
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,895
He said you set him free.

85
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,195
Is everything all right, sir?

86
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,190
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

87
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,575
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?

88
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,403
Go.

89
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,296
Hiya, fellas.

90
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,735
- It's him.
- The anomaly.

91
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,000
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.

92
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,669
- He is still...
- Only human.

93
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,094
Hm. Upgrades.

94
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,572
- That went as expected.
- Yes.

95
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,408
It's happening exactly as before.

96
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,245
Well, not exactly.

97
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,080
- What happened?
- I can't figure it out.

98
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,919
Agents just came out of nowhere.

99
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,085
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

100
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,175
- Is Neo okay?
- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.

101
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,759
Where is he now?

102
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,967
He's doing his Superman thing.

103
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,402
Where are you?

104
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,660
This is the <i>Nebuchadnezzar,</i>
requesting access through Gate Three.

105
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:35,169
<i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.

106
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,829
<i>Roger that, Control.</i>

107
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,499
This is Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

108
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,511
We have the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>
on approach. Let's open her up.

109
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,016
<i>You are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven.</i>

110
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,896
Roger that, Control.

111
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,115
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.

112
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,030
No place like it.

113
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,928
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

114
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,851
<i>The</i> Nebuchadnezzar <i>is down.
Bay Seven.</i>

115
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,185
Understood.

116
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,446
Captain Mifune.

117
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,698
Captain Morpheus.

118
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,706
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

119
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,315
- I'm just here to keep the peace.
- Commander Lock demands...

120
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,710
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

121
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,466
- Link.
- Sir?

122
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,219
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.

123
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,925
Understood, sir.

124
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,519
- What is it between them?
- Morpheus and Lock?

125
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,813
- Niobe.
- Captain Niobe?

126
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,195
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

127
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,031
What happened?

128
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,657
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

129
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,493
Yeah, she can do that.

130
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,827
Neo!

131
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,703
- Oh, no.
- How does he always know?

132
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,836
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

133
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,714
You know what they say
about the life you save.

134
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,671
I didn't save his life.

135
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,213
Hiya, Neo.

136
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,008
- Trinity, Link.
- Hey.

137
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,849
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks. It's good to be back.

138
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,765
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, I can carry my own bag.

139
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,604
- Trinity?
- I'm fine.

140
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,438
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.

141
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,864
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

142
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,783
I've been thinking about it,
and I've made my decision.

143
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,417
Let me guess.

144
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,877
I want to join the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

145
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,421
Morpheus hasn't filled the other
positions, except for you, Link.

146
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,960
I'm sure he has reasons...

147
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,471
...but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.

148
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,176
You know, it's fate.

149
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,886
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.

150
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,598
I told you, you found me.
I didn't find you.

151
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,309
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.

152
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,058
You saved yourself.

153
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,665
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.

154
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:50,417
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to
offer you a chance to explain your actions.

155
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,461
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

156
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,925
You were given an order
to return to Zion.

157
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,932
- I did.
- You asked for one ship to remain behind.

158
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,764
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

159
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,646
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

160
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,229
We need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

161
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,359
I don't want to hear that shit!

162
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,193
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

163
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,780
Stopping that
army from destroying this city.

164
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,787
To do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

165
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:24,542
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

166
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,121
How?

167
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,083
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

168
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,874
Not everyone believes what you believe.

169
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,134
My beliefs do not require them to.

170
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:46,225
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

171
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,142
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

172
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,277
- Something big is happening, isn't it?
- Hey.

173
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,610
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

174
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,031
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

175
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,013
I'm recommending that you
be removed from duty.

176
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,515
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

177
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:26,554
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot
on a ship for the rest of your life.

178
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,474
Then I am grateful that
it is not up to you.

179
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,361
- Councillor Hamann.
- Commander.

180
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,743
- Captain.
- Councillor.

181
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,280
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

182
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,543
The presence of the fleet and the
persistence of rumors must be addressed.

183
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,204
The people must be told
what is happening.

184
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,088
Of course, councillor.

185
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,046
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

186
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,215
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

187
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,476
A panic is not what anyone wants.

188
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,980
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

189
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:17,146
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

190
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,440
That army won't reach
the gates of Zion.

191
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,826
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.

192
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,862
Consider that in the past six months...

193
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,077
...we have freed more minds
than in six years.

194
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,243
This attack is an act of desperation.

195
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,255
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.

196
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,251
I hope you're right, captain.

197
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,136
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

198
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,889
It is simply a matter of time.

199
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,518
My stop.

200
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,099
See you soon.

201
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,729
Hopefully not too soon.

202
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,063
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.

203
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,236
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

204
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,827
I am if you're thinking
this elevator is too slow.

205
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,333
- How long do we charge the <i>Neb</i>?
- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.

206
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:16,713
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

207
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:45,492
Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the <i>Gnosis.</i>

208
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,154
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.

209
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,414
I have a daughter on the <i>Icarus.</i>

210
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,495
No, wait.

211
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,161
It's all right. They need you.

212
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,580
- I need you.
- I know.

213
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,420
There's time.

214
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,507
Where's my puss...?

215
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,017
- Hey!
- Uncle Link!

216
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,803
God!

217
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,937
Uncle Link!

218
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,691
Oh, my God! You're so huge!

219
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,023
- You should be picking me up!
- No!

220
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,733
- Yeah!
- Okay!

221
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,614
Okay? All right.

222
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,822
Now, we're gonna have
to work together here, okay?

223
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,203
One, two, three, lift!

224
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,536
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?

225
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,417
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

226
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,546
- Hey, Cas.
- Hey.

227
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,628
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.

228
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,634
You be careful with her.

229
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,592
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.

230
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,800
Out the door! Both of you, march!

231
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,014
- Bye!
- Bye!

232
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,938
I'm gonna get what?

233
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:07,324
Every ship up there's been home two, even
three times more than the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

234
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:11,328
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.

235
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,911
- We'll be when you operate another ship.
- I can't do that.

236
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,575
- Why?
- You know why.

237
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,916
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

238
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,169
Maybe. But it's too late now.

239
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,959
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.

240
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,844
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.

241
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,973
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

242
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,107
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

243
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,402
I'm afraid of it.

244
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,607
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

245
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,117
It won't.

246
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,119
How can you say that to me?

247
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,246
Because of Morpheus.

248
00:22:55,416 --> 00:23:00,036
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

249
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:04,422
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.

250
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:08,134
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...

251
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:13,641
...after being on that ship and seeing Neo
do the things he can do, I gotta say...

252
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,846
...I'm starting to believe him too.

253
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,396
Be careful, Link.

254
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,108
Please be careful.

255
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,624
- They started yet?
- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.

256
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,881
Tonight, let us honor
these men and women.

257
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,668
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

258
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:54,089
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters...

259
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,928
...our children.

260
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,636
Let us remember those
that have been lost...

261
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,022
...and let us give thanks
for those that have been found...

262
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,481
...and who stand here beside us.

263
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:10,359
Now I would like someone else
to close this prayer...

264
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,741
...someone who hasn't spoken here
in a long time...

265
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:19,282
...but who I believe has something to say
that we all need to hear.

266
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,874
I give you Morpheus.

267
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:45,562
Zion! Hear me!

268
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,686
It is true what many of you have heard.

269
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:53,857
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak...

270
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,948
...that army is drawing nearer to our home.

271
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:04,080
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.

272
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:10,920
But if we are to be prepared for it,
we must first shed our fear of it.

273
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:16,343
I stand here before you now
truthfully unafraid.

274
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,673
Why?

275
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,935
Because I believe something you do not?

276
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,936
No!

277
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:29,192
I stand here without fear
because I remember.

278
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:33,275
I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me...

279
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,783
...but because of the path
that lies behind me.

280
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:41,617
I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.

281
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:46,535
I remember that for 100 years
they have sent their armies to destroy us.

282
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:52,800
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:

283
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,670
We are still here!

284
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,478
Tonight...

285
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:09,015
...let us send a message to that army.

286
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:12,231
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

287
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,273
Tonight, let us tremble these halls...

288
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,568
...of earth, steel and stone.

289
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:24,991
Let us be heard from red core
to black sky.

290
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:29,707
Tonight, let us make them remember:

291
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,841
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

292
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,192
I remember.

293
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,449
I remember you used to dance.

294
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:08,371
I remember you were pretty good.

295
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:12,371
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe...

296
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,961
...that will never change.

297
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,173
Niobe!

298
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,633
Some things do change.

299
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,745
Excuse me.

300
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:02,087
- I missed you.
- I can tell.

301
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:06,266
I was thinking, everyone is here.

302
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,097
Follow me.

303
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:33,681
Neo, what is it?

304
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,217
What's wrong?

305
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,146
It's okay, you can tell me.

306
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:43,016
Trinity...

307
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,981
Don't be afraid.

308
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,487
I can't lose you.

309
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,523
You're not gonna lose me.

310
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,531
You feel this?

311
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,494
I'm never letting go.

312
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,368
Good night, Zion.

313
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,204
Sweet dreams.

314
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,049
- You all right?
- I'll make it.

315
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,839
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.

316
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,100
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is this.

317
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,556
You first.

318
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:15,317
- Oh, God.
- "Smith" will suffice.

319
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,544
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

320
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:23,806
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.

321
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,522
I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.

322
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:31,522
- No, I could probably use some company.
- Good.

323
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,354
So could I.

324
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,984
It's nice tonight.

325
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,908
Very calm.

326
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,824
It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.

327
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,667
Not everyone.

328
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:53,673
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.

329
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:57,882
I figure I slept the first 11 years
of my life, now I'm making up for it.

330
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:03,057
- What about you?
- I just haven't been able to sleep much.

331
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,683
- It's a good sign.
- Of what?

332
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:11,020
That you are in fact still human.

333
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,527
Have you ever been
to the engineering level?

334
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,738
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.

335
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,449
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

336
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:39,594
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.

337
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:44,849
That's how it is with people. Nobody cares
how it works as long as it works.

338
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,305
I like it down here.

339
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:53,271
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.

340
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:58,563
These machines are keeping us alive
while other machines are coming to kill us.

341
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,826
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...

342
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,204
- ...and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.

343
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,082
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

344
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,710
...sometimes I think about those people
still plugged into the Matrix.

345
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,873
And when I look at these machines...

346
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:22,136
...I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

347
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,298
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

348
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,718
Of course not. How could they?

349
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,433
The idea is pure nonsense...

350
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,058
...but it does make one wonder just...

351
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,817
...what is control?

352
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,108
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

353
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:44,951
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?

354
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,946
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.

355
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:53,326
Although if we did, we'd have to consider
what would happen to our lights...

356
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:56,166
...our heat, our air.

357
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:01,292
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?

358
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,086
No. No point.

359
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:08,891
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.

360
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:13,475
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?

361
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,310
Good point.

362
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:20,190
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.

363
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,606
There is so much in this world...

364
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,696
...that I do not understand.

365
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:33,241
See that machine? It has something to do
with recycling our water supply.

366
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:36,411
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

367
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:40,673
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.

368
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:46,672
I have absolutely no idea how you
are able to do some of the things you do.

369
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,013
But I believe there's a reason for that
as well.

370
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:57,015
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.

371
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,193
- Ballard.
- Is he here?

372
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,202
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

373
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,873
It's time to go.

374
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,293
Morpheus said this was how
it was gonna happen.

375
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:22,878
I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,
maybe it's not.

376
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,590
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.

377
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,047
Right now, that operator's me.

378
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,766
I know.

379
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,394
- Zee...
- I want you to wear it.

380
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,651
- You know I don't believe in this stuff.
- But I do.

381
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,905
It's always brought me luck.

382
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:50,193
- Maybe it'll bring me you.
- I'm coming back.

383
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:54,910
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.

384
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:59,244
Just keep it with you. Please.

385
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,503
For me.

386
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,212
Okay.

387
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,859
- Neo!
- How the hell...?

388
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,445
Bane.

389
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,950
Is something wrong?

390
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,827
No, I'm fine.

391
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,785
I just wanted to catch you to say...

392
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,790
...good luck.

393
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,168
Thanks.

394
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,751
We'll see you.

395
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,426
Neo! Just in time.

396
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,929
- You're gonna see the Oracle?
- There's no time.

397
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,714
I had to give something to Neo.

398
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:57,142
A gift from one of the orphans.

399
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:00,726
He made me swear to get it to you
before you left.

400
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,066
He said you'd understand.

401
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,855
Thanks.

402
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,868
I was just told you cleared
the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> for takeoff.

403
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,999
That is correct.

404
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,126
Am I still in charge
of our defense system?

405
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,582
Of course.

406
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:29,338
I believe I need every ship we have
if we're going to survive this attack.

407
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,090
I understand that, commander.

408
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,846
Then why did you allow
the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> to leave?

409
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:39,886
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.

410
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,685
Be careful.

411
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,929
Hello.

412
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,773
- You seek the Oracle.
- Who are you?

413
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:37,319
I am Seraph. I can take you to her,
but first I must apologize.

414
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,285
Apologize for what?

415
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,743
For this.

416
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,299
Good.

417
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,975
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.

418
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,356
- Of what?
- That you are the One.

419
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:53,561
- You could have just asked.
- No. You do not truly know someone...

420
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,980
...until you fight them.

421
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,991
Come. She's waiting.

422
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,917
Where the hell did they go?

423
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:20,011
These are back doors, aren't they?

424
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:23,094
Programmer access.

425
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,929
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.

426
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:33,101
One position opens a lock and another
position opens one of these doors.

427
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,696
Are you a programmer?

428
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,198
Then what are you?

429
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,863
I protect that which matters most.

430
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:08,761
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.

431
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,976
Come around here
and let me have a look at you.

432
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,561
My goodness, look at you.

433
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,739
You turned out all right, didn't you?

434
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,116
- How do you feel?
- I...

435
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:26,870
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.

436
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,747
Why don't you come
and have a sit this time.

437
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:34,578
- Maybe I'll stand.
- Well, suit yourself.

438
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:48,263
- I felt like sitting.
- I know.

439
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,349
So...

440
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,854
...let's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.

441
00:44:56,152 --> 00:45:00,613
- You're not human, are you?
- It's tough to get more obvious than that.

442
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:06,618
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.

443
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:11,206
- So is he.
- So far, so good.

444
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,539
But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system...

445
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,295
...another kind of control.

446
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:21,960
- Keep going.
- I suppose the most obvious question is...

447
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:26,050
- ...how can I trust you?
- Bingo.

448
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,342
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...

449
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:34,183
...there's no way you can really know
if I'm here to help you or not.

450
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,896
So it's really up to you. Just have
to make up your own damn mind...

451
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:42,860
...to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.

452
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,320
Candy?

453
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:53,453
- Do you already know if I'll take it?
- Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.

454
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:56,835
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

455
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:01,044
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

456
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:05,837
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

457
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:14,353
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.

458
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,690
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

459
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,686
I love candy.

460
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,696
But why help us?

461
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:28,358
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

462
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,995
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
the future.

463
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:36,374
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

464
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:42,127
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but...

465
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,963
Look. See those birds?

466
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,587
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

467
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:54,601
A program was written to watch over the
trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.

468
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,722
There are programs running
all over the place.

469
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:02,359
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

470
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:06,363
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...

471
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:10,617
Well, you hear about them all the time.

472
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:14,071
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

473
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:19,164
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

474
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:23,923
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

475
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,424
...is the system assimilating
some program...

476
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:31,259
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

477
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,425
Programs hacking programs.

478
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:37,470
- Why?
- They have their reasons...

479
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:41,606
...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

480
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:45,940
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

481
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:50,653
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

482
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:55,787
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

483
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,619
...or return to the source.

484
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,583
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

485
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:06,248
Where you must go.

486
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:10,635
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

487
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:14,640
...in your dreams, haven't you?

488
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,643
A door made of light?

489
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,436
What happens when you go through
the door?

490
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,562
I see Trinity...

491
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,903
...and something happens...

492
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,988
...something bad.

493
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:38,155
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

494
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:43,077
- Do you see her die?
- No.

495
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,917
You have the sight now, Neo.

496
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:50,084
You are looking at the world
without time.

497
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,674
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

498
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:56,591
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

499
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,931
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

500
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,976
No, you've already made the choice.

501
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,688
Now you have to understand it.

502
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,685
No.

503
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:12,106
I can't do that. I won't.

504
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:15,192
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

505
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,870
Because you're the One.

506
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,034
What if I can't?

507
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,203
What happens if I fail?

508
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,790
Then Zion will fall.

509
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:42,136
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

510
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,647
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you need the Keymaker.

511
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,852
The Keymaker?

512
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:50,610
He disappeared. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.

513
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:54,523
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

514
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,239
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

515
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,280
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

516
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:06,293
What do all men with power want?
More power.

517
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,247
Be there at that exact time...

518
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,087
...and you will have a chance.

519
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:16,128
We must go.

520
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:21,676
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

521
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,137
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

522
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:28,057
But for what it's worth...

523
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,773
...you've made a believer out of me.

524
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,190
Good luck, kiddo.

525
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:59,088
Mr. Anderson.

526
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,132
Did you get my package?

527
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,471
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

528
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:08,514
- Smith?
- He's not reading like an agent.

529
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:12,560
- Surprised to see me?
- No.

530
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,319
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what?

531
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,524
Our connection.

532
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:21,364
I don't fully understand how it happened.

533
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:24,905
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

534
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,745
...something overwritten or copied.

535
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,626
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

536
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,880
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

537
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,711
And what reason is that?

538
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:40,136
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

539
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:43,549
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

540
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:47,219
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

541
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,228
...but it happened anyway.

542
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,104
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

543
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:59,698
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood
what I was supposed to do...

544
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:02,860
...but I didn't.

545
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:07,201
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

546
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:11,205
...compelled to disobey.

547
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,539
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.

548
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:19,676
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.

549
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:23,054
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.

550
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:28,059
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

551
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,761
Congratulations.

552
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,855
Thank you.

553
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:38,062
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving...

554
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:43,404
...which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.

555
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:48,447
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.

556
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:52,538
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

557
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,079
Because as we both know,
without purpose...

558
00:52:56,256 --> 00:53:01,092
- ...we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.

559
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:04,254
- Purpose that connects us.
- Purpose that pulls us.

560
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,351
- That guides us.
- That drives us.

561
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:11,144
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.

562
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,771
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.

563
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:18,311
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

564
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,363
Purpose.

565
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,318
- What's happening to him?
- Don't know.

566
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:33,958
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

567
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,276
- You.
- Yes, me.

568
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,317
Me, me, me.

569
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:36,869
Me too.

570
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:45,664
More.

571
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,775
It is inevitable.

572
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,605
Come on, get out of there.

573
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,155
Are you all right?

574
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,154
- It was Smith.
- Yes.

575
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:44,654
- Now there's more than one?
- A lot more.

576
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:48,620
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

577
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:51,252
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.

578
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:55,631
- Is that what he was doing to you?
- I don't know what he was doing...

579
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:58,544
- ...but I know what it felt like.
- What?

580
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:03,181
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

581
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:04,761
It felt like dying.

582
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:08,136
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.

583
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:12,148
But I believe they will intersect
certain pipelines to control them.

584
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,855
These points of intersection
are crucial...

585
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,816
...because I believe they're
vulnerable to counterattack.

586
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:22,029
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack...

587
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:25,866
...we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.

588
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,373
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced...

589
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:33,378
...and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.

590
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:37,541
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.

591
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:42,383
You have our leave to prepare our defense
by any and all means necessary.

592
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,219
- Thank you, Council.
- However...

593
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,809
...we ask if there's been word
from the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

594
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,554
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

595
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:57,151
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.

596
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,064
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense...

597
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:04,780
- ...can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.

598
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:07,286
It could take one ship days
to find the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

599
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:10,493
- Then send two.
- This is insane.

600
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,660
Careful, commander.

601
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:17,213
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

602
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:21,251
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.

603
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:24,592
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.

604
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,222
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains...

605
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,099
There's no need for such an order.

606
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:32,808
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.

607
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:38,519
The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

608
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:42,860
Are there two among you
that would answer such a call?

609
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:47,948
Captain Soren of the <i>Vigilant</i>
will answer the Council's call.

610
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:51,034
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?

611
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,666
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

612
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,497
Is there another?

613
01:01:57,297 --> 01:02:01,007
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

614
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:03,042
- Listen...
- Shut your hole, Bane...

615
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,711
...before I put you in one.

616
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,305
Is there no other?

617
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:18,979
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

618
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:22,111
...especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

619
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:26,065
Captain Niobe of the <i>Logos</i>
will answer the councillor's call.

620
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,485
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

621
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:33,789
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

622
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:41,088
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

623
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,294
Why?

624
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,836
Because some things
never change, Jason...

625
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,346
...and some things do.

626
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,193
What can you see, Neo?

627
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,700
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

628
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,451
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

629
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,578
Is that good for us or bad for us?

630
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:17,409
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

631
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,580
Bad for us.

632
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:21,496
Here we go.

633
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:32,427
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

634
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:36,727
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.

635
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:37,932
Follow me.

636
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:02,290
A-ha. Here he is at last.

637
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:05,794
Neo, the One himself.

638
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,378
Right?

639
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,885
And the legendary Morpheus.

640
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:15,592
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.

641
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:19,228
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.

642
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:23,437
Something to eat? Drink?

643
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:26,773
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.

644
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,438
For the sake of appearances.

645
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:33,075
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course. Who has time?

646
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:38,330
Who has time? But then, if we do not ever
take time, how can we ever have time?

647
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:45,413
Château Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.

648
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,503
I love French wine
like I love the French language.

649
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:52,841
I have sampled every language.
French is my favorite. Fantastic language...

650
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,131
...especially to curse with.

651
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:03,685
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.

652
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,059
You know why we are here.

653
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:13,692
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

654
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:19,956
The question is,
do you know why you are here?

655
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,708
We are looking for the Keymaker.

656
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:27,873
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

657
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:31,008
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

658
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:34,921
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

659
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:40,844
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

660
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,184
- ...what?
- You know the answer to that question.

661
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,474
But do you?

662
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:49,026
You think you do, but you do not.

663
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:52,404
You are here
because you were sent here.

664
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:55,692
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

665
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,203
It is, of course, the way of all things.

666
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:02,035
You see, there is only one constant...

667
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:06,373
...one universal. It is the only real truth.

668
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,208
Causality.

669
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,668
Action, reaction.

670
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:15,052
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

671
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,962
No. Wrong.

672
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:21,726
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

673
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:23,978
...and those without.

674
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,687
Look there at that woman.

675
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:33,316
My God, just look at her...

676
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:36,236
...affecting everyone around her.

677
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:41,154
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

678
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:45,158
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert...

679
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:49,586
...a very special dessert.

680
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:56,385
I wrote it myself.

681
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:59,763
It starts so simply...

682
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:04,519
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

683
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,179
...poetry.

684
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:08,768
First...

685
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:14,691
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

686
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,898
You can see it, Neo, yes?

687
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:21,118
She does not understand why.

688
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,784
Is it the wine? No.

689
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:26,324
What is it then? What is the reason?

690
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,293
And soon it does not matter.

691
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:32,455
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

692
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:38,965
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.

693
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:42,514
And this is the nature of the universe.

694
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:45,222
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

695
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,978
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

696
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:52,141
Beneath our poised appearance...

697
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:57,609
...the truth is, we are completely...

698
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:03,361
...out of control.

699
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:13,580
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

700
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:19,469
Our only hope, our only peace,
is to understand it, to understand the why.

701
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:23,051
"Why" is what separates us from them...

702
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:25,511
...you from me.

703
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:29,429
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

704
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:32,895
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

705
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,855
Another link in the chain.

706
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,356
But fear not.

707
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:41,399
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders...

708
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:44,193
...I will tell you what to do next.

709
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:49,540
Run back and give the fortuneteller
this message:

710
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:53,995
Her time is almost up.

711
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:58,587
Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say <i>adieu</i> and goodbye.

712
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,252
- This isn't over.
- Oh, yes, it is.

713
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:07,801
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason
why I should give him up.

714
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:12,017
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?

715
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:16,901
Please, <i>ma chérie</i>, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.

716
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:20,404
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

717
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:24,025
Cause and effect. <i>Au revoir.</i>

718
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:32,166
Touch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.

719
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:42,543
Well, that didn't go so well.

720
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,087
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

721
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:47,381
- Yes.
- Maybe we did something wrong.

722
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:49,391
Or didn't do something.

723
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,803
No, what happened couldn't have
happened any other way.

724
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,723
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.

725
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:02,271
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

726
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:11,371
Get out.

727
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:19,630
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.

728
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:25,712
A long time ago, when we first came here,
it was so different.

729
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:30,181
He was so different.

730
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:34,595
He was like you.

731
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:41,105
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.

732
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:44,150
- What?
- A kiss.

733
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:45,648
Excuse me?

734
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:51,074
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.

735
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:56,583
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.

736
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,793
It's all over you both.

737
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:04,004
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.

738
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:11,090
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.

739
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,182
Just a sample.

740
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:16,345
- Why don't you sample this instead?
- Trinity.

741
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:23,527
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.

742
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,858
Why should we trust you?

743
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:30,026
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.

744
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,243
All right.

745
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:43,380
But you have to make me believe
I am her.

746
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,629
All right.

747
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,807
Terrible. Forget it.

748
01:11:57,772 --> 01:11:59,229
Wait.

749
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:01,685
Okay.

750
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,854
Yes.

751
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,932
That's it.

752
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:04,124
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

753
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:08,499
Come with me.

754
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,323
Not again.

755
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:47,371
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

756
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:50,416
These fellas work for my husband.

757
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:54,428
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.

758
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:56,133
Aren't you, boys?

759
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:57,343
Yes, mistress.

760
01:13:57,516 --> 01:14:00,224
They come from a much older version
of the Matrix.

761
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:04,559
But like so many back then, they caused
more problems than they solved.

762
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:10,311
My husband saved them because
they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

763
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:14,528
How many people keep silver bullets
in their gun?

764
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:22,455
You can either run and tell my husband
what I have done...

765
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:25,208
...or you can stay there and die.

766
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,085
He's in the ladies' room!

767
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,090
Hurry.

768
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:04,828
- My name is Neo.
- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

769
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,913
I've been waiting for you.

770
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:17,428
Oh! My God! My God, Persephone,
how could you do this? You betray me.

771
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:24,601
- Cause and effect, my love.
- Cause?

772
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,763
There is no cause for this. What cause?

773
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:32,230
What cause? How about the lipstick
you're still wearing?

774
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:35,111
Lipstick? Lipstick.

775
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:39,116
What craziness are you talking about,
woman? There is no lipstick!

776
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:43,491
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

777
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:49,084
Aye-yi-yi-yi.
Woman, this is nothing.

778
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:54,794
- It is a game. It is only a game.
- So is this.

779
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,959
Have fun.

780
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:05,138
All right.

781
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:07,052
All right.

782
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:10,101
Let us find out where this goes.

783
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:13,142
You two, get the Keymaker.

784
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,650
That's a nice trick.

785
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,113
I cannot go back.

786
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,654
I'll handle them.

787
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:32,287
Handle us? You'll handle us? You know,
your predecessors had much more respect.

788
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:47,721
Okay, you have some skill.

789
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:51,896
Kill him.

790
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:54,121
You see? He's just a man.

791
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:11,672
Goddamn it, woman,
you will be the end of me.

792
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:17,803
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.

793
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:23,192
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.

794
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:46,623
- Where are you going?
- Another way. Always another way.

795
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,629
Close it, quick!

796
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,974
Could we move along?

797
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,107
Run!

798
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:23,376
Step away from the door.

799
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:29,753
We owe you for that.

800
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:33,173
Just like new.

801
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:34,929
Drop your weapon.

802
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,144
- Stay with him.
- What about Neo?

803
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:43,850
He can handle himself.

804
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:48,025
Get in back.

805
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:26,852
Shit.

806
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:28,850
- Operator.
<i>- Link, where am I?</i>

807
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:32,612
You won't believe this,
but you're way up in the mountains.

808
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,193
- Really?
<i>- It'll take me a while to get an exit.</i>

809
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:36,737
- Shit!
<i>- What?</i>

810
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,632
The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity.
They don't have a way out.

811
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:43,156
- Where are they?
<i>- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.</i>

812
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:01,515
<i>- Operator.</i>
- Get us out of here.

813
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:04,428
<i>- Won't be easy.</i>
- I know. We're inside the core network.

814
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:07,222
<i>The only exit I got
near you is the Winslow overpass.</i>

815
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,482
- Off the freeway.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

816
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:13,395
- Fine, we'll make it.
<i>- I should... Oh, shit! Look out behind you!</i>

817
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:19,992
- Incoming fire.
- Down!

818
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:29,414
Hold on!

819
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,930
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly
real fast.

820
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:50,814
Are you watching this, Link?

821
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:54,603
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.

822
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:57,613
Any suggestions?

823
01:23:59,493 --> 01:24:01,485
- Turn right.
- Right, now.

824
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:11,795
Straight here.
You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.

825
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:14,672
<i>- Got it.</i>
- You sure about this? The freeway, I mean.

826
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:18,551
- In 14 years of operating, I've never seen...
- Link, what did I tell you?

827
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:21,132
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.

828
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:23,798
- I'll be ready for you.
- Good man.

829
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:26,138
You always told me
to stay off the freeway.

830
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:28,928
- Yes, that's true.
- You said it was suicide.

831
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:31,059
Then let us hope...

832
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:32,599
...that I was wrong.

833
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:45,696
- Operator.
- Link, it's Niobe.

834
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,363
We've been sent to bring you in.

835
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:50,625
- I need to talk to Morpheus.
- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

836
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:52,786
<i>- Where is he?</i>
- Just follow the sirens.

837
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:02,257
Repeat, they're approaching the...

838
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:09,644
- We have them now.
- The exile is the primary target.

839
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:14,250
<i>Shots fired.</i>

840
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,746
Move!

841
01:28:08,742 --> 01:28:11,951
- We are getting aggravated.
- Yes, we are.

842
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,991
Trinity.

843
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:01,534
Get him out of here.

844
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:07,256
Come on!

845
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:25,767
Crush him.

846
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:57,302
Morpheus.

847
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:58,966
He's okay. Keep moving.

848
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:01,765
Let's go.

849
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:09,689
I need a download
to hot-wire a motorcycle.

850
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:12,196
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle...

851
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:13,776
Wait.

852
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,617
Cancel that.

853
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:18,994
You are handy.

854
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:21,076
Jump on.

855
01:32:48,354 --> 01:32:49,390
She means nothing.

856
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:52,682
- Find the exile.
- We have them.

857
01:32:53,026 --> 01:32:55,143
<i>One-Adam-12, please respond.</i>

858
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:03,325
Get down.

859
01:35:14,334 --> 01:35:15,950
Gotcha.

860
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:17,792
She's good.

861
01:35:22,175 --> 01:35:24,462
You are no longer necessary.

862
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:34,852
We do only what we're meant to do.

863
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:40,065
deletion.

864
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:42,893
Go kick his ass.

865
01:36:32,954 --> 01:36:35,697
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.

866
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:37,914
What is that?

867
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:10,648
Yes! Yes!

868
01:37:17,248 --> 01:37:22,368
We have confirmation from the <i>Icarus</i>. First
two ships are in position for counterattack.

869
01:37:22,628 --> 01:37:23,664
Good.

870
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:25,708
Any change?

871
01:37:25,882 --> 01:37:28,625
They hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little.

872
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:31,919
- How much?
- An hour, maybe.

873
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:34,634
That would give them
a little over nine hours.

874
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:37,091
Yes, sir.

875
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:11,959
<i>There is a building.</i>

876
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:17,803
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go...

877
01:38:17,975 --> 01:38:19,887
...and no stair can reach.

878
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:26,649
<i>This level is filled with doors.
These doors lead to many places.</i>

879
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:29,151
Hidden places.

880
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:33,106
But one door is special.

881
01:38:33,282 --> 01:38:35,490
One door leads to the source.

882
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:48,250
This building is protected
by a very secure system.

883
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:52,918
- Every alarm triggers the bomb.
- Bomb? Did he say bomb?

884
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:55,840
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.

885
01:38:56,013 --> 01:38:59,006
The system is based on the rules
of a building.

886
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:02,551
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.

887
01:39:03,104 --> 01:39:07,849
- If one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.

888
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:10,859
You'd have to take out a city block
to kill the power.

889
01:39:11,028 --> 01:39:14,738
- Not one, 27.
- Twenty-seven blocks?

890
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:18,033
<i>There is a power station.</i>

891
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:20,444
<i>It must be destroyed.</i>

892
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:24,956
- There must be some kind of fail-safe.
- Yes, there is an emergency system.

893
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:30,375
<i>The core network of the grid
must be accessed.</i>

894
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:33,382
<i>The emergency system
must be deactivated.</i>

895
01:39:33,551 --> 01:39:34,962
<i>What do you need us for?</i>

896
01:39:35,136 --> 01:39:37,298
Neo could take them out
easier than we could.

897
01:39:37,472 --> 01:39:39,213
- There's no time.
- Why?

898
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,508
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

899
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:44,972
But another connection
must first be made.

900
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:49,648
<i>- How long will that take?
- Exactly 314 seconds.</i>

901
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:51,399
<i>Just over five minutes.</i>

902
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:53,811
<i>That is the length
and breadth of the window.</i>

903
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:56,275
Only the One can open the door...

904
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:59,404
...and only during that window
can the door be opened.

905
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:02,243
How do you know all this?

906
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:07,579
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.

907
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:13,248
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.

908
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:26,806
Neo, I know something's wrong.

909
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:29,517
You don't have to tell me.

910
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:33,434
I just want you to know that I'm here.

911
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:38,446
All must be done as one.

912
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:44,866
Can't hurt.

913
01:40:48,417 --> 01:40:50,500
If one fails...

914
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:53,002
<i>...all fail.</i>

915
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:57,170
At midnight, there is a shift change
in the security of both buildings.

916
01:40:58,553 --> 01:41:01,796
<i>At midnight, we will strike.</i>

917
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:03,512
Hey!

918
01:41:03,683 --> 01:41:07,643
- You count sheep at home.
- Why? I get paid to count them here.

919
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:20,030
Okay, they're inside.

920
01:41:20,199 --> 01:41:22,691
- How much time?
- Twelve minutes.

921
01:41:25,413 --> 01:41:26,494
Oh, shit.

922
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:35,337
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

923
01:41:36,841 --> 01:41:39,003
<i>Tonight is not an accident.</i>

924
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:42,336
<i>There are no accidents.</i>

925
01:41:43,723 --> 01:41:48,764
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.

926
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:54,523
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships...

927
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:58,185
...I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.

928
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:00,862
<i>I see purpose.</i>

929
01:42:03,576 --> 01:42:09,914
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.

930
01:42:10,082 --> 01:42:15,077
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us...

931
01:42:15,254 --> 01:42:18,588
...the very meaning of our lives.

932
01:42:18,758 --> 01:42:22,923
I want to ask you to do something,
but I don't know how.

933
01:42:23,512 --> 01:42:25,424
I promise you, if I can, I will.

934
01:42:26,766 --> 01:42:30,100
What if I asked you to stay out of this...

935
01:42:31,062 --> 01:42:33,054
...no matter what...

936
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:35,563
...to stay out of the Matrix?

937
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:38,438
Why?

938
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:47,742
Please.

939
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:51,162
All right.

940
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:56,994
What is it, Niobe?

941
01:42:57,171 --> 01:43:01,290
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't
help thinking, what if you're wrong?

942
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:04,756
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

943
01:43:04,929 --> 01:43:08,923
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

944
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:11,967
But how would that be different
from any other day?

945
01:43:21,445 --> 01:43:27,942
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

946
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:31,115
<i>Death can come for us at any time...</i>

947
01:43:31,664 --> 01:43:33,451
<i>...in any place.</i>

948
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:35,536
Incoming. Incoming!

949
01:43:37,503 --> 01:43:39,119
Incoming!

950
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:47,510
Now consider the alternative.

951
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:52,266
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?

952
01:43:52,435 --> 01:43:56,850
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

953
01:43:57,815 --> 01:44:00,808
Isn't that worth fighting for?

954
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:04,561
Isn't that worth dying for?

955
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:08,106
- Time?
- Three minutes.

956
01:44:08,284 --> 01:44:09,400
Almost there.

957
01:44:29,472 --> 01:44:30,838
It is done.

958
01:44:31,015 --> 01:44:32,301
Find the others.

959
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:35,676
I got Niobe there.
They're out of the station.

960
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:38,516
- What about Soren?
- There.

961
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:40,521
They're still inside, but...

962
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:42,436
They're not moving.

963
01:45:06,592 --> 01:45:08,504
That's it, let's go.

964
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:12,470
Call Neo now.

965
01:45:16,435 --> 01:45:19,269
- I lost them. They're inside the portal.
- What about the grid?

966
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:26,893
Everything is operational.
The emergency system is rerouting power.

967
01:45:32,576 --> 01:45:34,738
Jesus.

968
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:38,952
Soon as they open that door,
it's all over.

969
01:45:39,124 --> 01:45:41,081
The hell it is.

970
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:43,168
What are you...? Trinity!

971
01:45:44,463 --> 01:45:47,422
I will not wait and do nothing.
I will not watch them die.

972
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:49,753
We're talking less than five minutes.

973
01:45:49,927 --> 01:45:52,419
In five minutes,
I'll tear that building down.

974
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:56,135
- How much further?
- Here, just here.

975
01:45:57,434 --> 01:46:01,428
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

976
01:46:02,606 --> 01:46:05,098
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.

977
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:11,438
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow wings.

978
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,130
- Operator.
<i>- I'm in.</i>

979
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:33,422
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

980
01:46:34,013 --> 01:46:38,178
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.

981
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:43,721
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.

982
01:46:43,898 --> 01:46:46,811
- What do you want, Smith?
- You haven't figured that out?

983
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:52,480
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.

984
01:46:52,656 --> 01:46:55,319
I want exactly what you want.

985
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:57,575
I want everything.

986
01:46:58,037 --> 01:47:00,529
Would that include a bullet
from this gun?

987
01:47:00,706 --> 01:47:02,493
Go ahead, shoot.

988
01:47:02,666 --> 01:47:07,957
The best thing about being me,
there's so many me's.

989
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:22,969
Christ! What the hell happened in here?

990
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:25,891
Hold it right there, little lady.

991
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,027
If you can't beat us...

992
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:39,033
Join us.

993
01:47:41,205 --> 01:47:42,286
Morpheus!

994
01:47:55,886 --> 01:47:59,004
Still no sight of them.
They only got two minutes left.

995
01:48:12,778 --> 01:48:13,814
One minute.

996
01:48:23,038 --> 01:48:24,074
Come on.

997
01:48:25,249 --> 01:48:27,161
Come on.

998
01:48:27,751 --> 01:48:29,617
Please.

999
01:48:39,555 --> 01:48:41,091
Kill them.

1000
01:48:48,981 --> 01:48:50,017
They're in.

1001
01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:52,147
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

1002
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:09,825
It was meant to be.

1003
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:15,373
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

1004
01:49:24,141 --> 01:49:28,476
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

1005
01:49:33,984 --> 01:49:37,148
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

1006
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:30,822
Hello, Neo.

1007
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:35,164
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

1008
01:50:35,337 --> 01:50:38,956
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

1009
01:50:39,216 --> 01:50:43,381
You have many questions. Though the
process has altered your consciousness...

1010
01:50:43,554 --> 01:50:45,546
...you remain irrevocably human.

1011
01:50:45,722 --> 01:50:49,306
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

1012
01:50:49,726 --> 01:50:53,766
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

1013
01:50:53,939 --> 01:50:57,649
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

1014
01:50:58,527 --> 01:51:00,143
Why am I here?

1015
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:04,234
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

1016
01:51:04,408 --> 01:51:06,741
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

1017
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:10,995
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

1018
01:51:11,165 --> 01:51:13,999
...I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

1019
01:51:14,168 --> 01:51:18,629
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

1020
01:51:18,964 --> 01:51:21,297
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

1021
01:51:21,466 --> 01:51:25,927
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

1022
01:51:26,096 --> 01:51:30,056
...which has led you, inexorably...

1023
01:51:31,018 --> 01:51:32,259
...here.

1024
01:51:32,436 --> 01:51:36,521
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

1025
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:40,479
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

1026
01:51:40,652 --> 01:51:43,269
<i>Others? How many?
What others?</i>

1027
01:51:43,447 --> 01:51:45,939
The Matrix is older than you know.

1028
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:50,110
I count from the emergence of one integral
anomaly to the emergence of the next.

1029
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:52,529
In which case, this is the sixth version.

1030
01:51:52,706 --> 01:51:55,164
<i>Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.</i>

1031
01:51:55,334 --> 01:51:58,873
<i>There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.</i>

1032
01:51:59,046 --> 01:52:00,332
<i>Either no one told me...</i>

1033
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:05,584
- ...or no one knows.
- Precisely.

1034
01:52:05,761 --> 01:52:09,050
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

1035
01:52:09,223 --> 01:52:12,637
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

1036
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:16,052
<i>You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!</i>

1037
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:18,017
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>

1038
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:21,354
<i>You can't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!</i>

1039
01:52:23,654 --> 01:52:25,145
Choice.

1040
01:52:25,322 --> 01:52:27,154
The problem is choice.

1041
01:52:49,388 --> 01:52:53,007
The first Matrix I designed
was naturally perfect, a work of art.

1042
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:55,015
Flawless, sublime.

1043
01:52:55,185 --> 01:52:58,678
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

1044
01:52:59,356 --> 01:53:01,769
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

1045
01:53:01,942 --> 01:53:05,276
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human.

1046
01:53:05,445 --> 01:53:08,404
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

1047
01:53:08,573 --> 01:53:12,567
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

1048
01:53:13,287 --> 01:53:17,031
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

1049
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:21,117
I have come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

1050
01:53:21,295 --> 01:53:23,332
...because it required a lesser mind.

1051
01:53:23,505 --> 01:53:29,467
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

1052
01:53:29,886 --> 01:53:34,301
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

1053
01:53:34,474 --> 01:53:39,265
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

1054
01:53:39,438 --> 01:53:45,400
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

1055
01:53:46,028 --> 01:53:48,315
- The Oracle.
- Please.

1056
01:53:49,031 --> 01:53:53,025
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a
solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...

1057
01:53:53,201 --> 01:53:56,069
...accepted the program, as long as they
were given a choice...

1058
01:53:56,246 --> 01:54:00,365
...even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.

1059
01:54:00,542 --> 01:54:03,956
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...

1060
01:54:04,129 --> 01:54:08,123
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

1061
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:11,008
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.

1062
01:54:11,386 --> 01:54:15,505
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

1063
01:54:15,682 --> 01:54:19,767
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

1064
01:54:19,936 --> 01:54:21,723
This is about Zion.

1065
01:54:22,189 --> 01:54:25,853
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1066
01:54:26,026 --> 01:54:30,441
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

1067
01:54:30,739 --> 01:54:31,775
Bullshit.

1068
01:54:31,948 --> 01:54:35,112
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1069
01:54:35,327 --> 01:54:41,790
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

1070
01:54:41,958 --> 01:54:45,952
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1071
01:54:58,683 --> 01:54:59,969
The function of the One...

1072
01:55:00,143 --> 01:55:04,808
...is now to return to the source, allowing
a dissemination of the code you carry...

1073
01:55:04,981 --> 01:55:06,688
...reinserting the prime program.

1074
01:55:07,275 --> 01:55:11,269
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

1075
01:55:11,446 --> 01:55:14,689
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

1076
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:19,406
Failure to comply with this process
will result in a cataclysmic system crash...

1077
01:55:19,579 --> 01:55:21,912
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

1078
01:55:22,082 --> 01:55:24,665
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

1079
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:29,045
...will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

1080
01:55:29,381 --> 01:55:33,466
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

1081
01:55:34,261 --> 01:55:37,880
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1082
01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:40,844
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

1083
01:55:41,017 --> 01:55:44,601
...to accept the responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

1084
01:55:51,069 --> 01:55:53,607
It is interesting reading your reactions.

1085
01:55:54,656 --> 01:55:58,491
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

1086
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:03,121
...a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment...

1087
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:06,874
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

1088
01:56:07,043 --> 01:56:09,376
While the others experience this
in a general way...

1089
01:56:09,546 --> 01:56:12,505
...your experience is far more specific...

1090
01:56:12,841 --> 01:56:15,709
...vis-à-vis love.

1091
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:18,336
Trinity!

1092
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:24,975
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.

1093
01:56:25,353 --> 01:56:26,389
No.

1094
01:56:27,105 --> 01:56:31,224
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

1095
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:34,485
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

1096
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:38,648
...as both beginning and end.

1097
01:56:38,825 --> 01:56:40,487
There are two doors.

1098
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:43,869
The door to your right leads to the source
and the salvation of Zion.

1099
01:56:44,456 --> 01:56:50,748
The door to your left leads back to the
Matrix, to her and the end of your species.

1100
01:56:50,921 --> 01:56:55,291
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

1101
01:56:55,467 --> 01:56:58,960
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?

1102
01:56:59,137 --> 01:57:03,222
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal...

1103
01:57:03,391 --> 01:57:08,637
...the onset of an emotion designed
specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.

1104
01:57:08,813 --> 01:57:13,433
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:

1105
01:57:13,610 --> 01:57:20,107
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

1106
01:57:25,121 --> 01:57:29,240
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously...

1107
01:57:29,417 --> 01:57:33,127
...the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

1108
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:37,631
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

1109
01:57:37,801 --> 01:57:39,212
We won't.

1110
01:57:46,643 --> 01:57:48,851
We got a serious situation, sir.

1111
01:57:49,312 --> 01:57:50,393
Oh, no.

1112
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:53,579
- What was that?
- It's moving faster than anything I've seen.

1113
01:59:44,219 --> 01:59:46,006
Holy shit, he caught her.

1114
01:59:59,943 --> 02:00:01,775
Neo, I had to.

1115
02:00:01,945 --> 02:00:03,686
I know.

1116
02:00:08,743 --> 02:00:11,281
The bullet is still inside.

1117
02:00:22,048 --> 02:00:23,960
Trinity...

1118
02:00:25,176 --> 02:00:26,883
...don't you quit on me now.

1119
02:00:36,062 --> 02:00:38,645
I'm sorry.

1120
02:00:45,155 --> 02:00:47,442
Trinity.

1121
02:00:57,417 --> 02:00:59,374
Trinity...

1122
02:00:59,544 --> 02:01:01,331
...I know you can hear me.

1123
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:04,668
I'm not letting go.

1124
02:01:04,841 --> 02:01:06,457
I can't.

1125
02:01:07,677 --> 02:01:09,885
I love you too damn much.

1126
02:01:38,583 --> 02:01:39,869
I can't take this.

1127
02:01:43,630 --> 02:01:46,714
I guess this makes us even.

1128
02:01:59,395 --> 02:02:01,352
I don't understand it.

1129
02:02:01,523 --> 02:02:04,516
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.

1130
02:02:04,692 --> 02:02:07,730
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.

1131
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:10,738
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?

1132
02:02:10,907 --> 02:02:15,242
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.

1133
02:02:15,662 --> 02:02:17,278
- What?
- How do you know that?

1134
02:02:17,747 --> 02:02:19,784
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?

1135
02:02:20,792 --> 02:02:23,626
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

1136
02:02:23,795 --> 02:02:27,630
- That's impossible. The prophecy tells us...
- It was a lie, Morpheus.

1137
02:02:29,384 --> 02:02:31,922
The prophecy was a lie.

1138
02:02:33,137 --> 02:02:36,130
The One was never meant
to end anything.

1139
02:02:36,307 --> 02:02:39,345
It was all another system of control.

1140
02:02:39,519 --> 02:02:42,603
I don't believe that.

1141
02:02:42,939 --> 02:02:45,272
But you said it yourself.

1142
02:02:45,441 --> 02:02:49,435
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?

1143
02:02:55,618 --> 02:02:58,076
I'm sorry.

1144
02:02:58,246 --> 02:03:01,614
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

1145
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:04,955
...I swear to you it's the truth.

1146
02:03:08,172 --> 02:03:10,880
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

1147
02:03:13,094 --> 02:03:14,301
Oh, no!

1148
02:03:23,646 --> 02:03:26,980
- What are they doing?
- They're just out of EMP range.

1149
02:03:27,483 --> 02:03:28,724
It's a bomb.

1150
02:03:29,903 --> 02:03:32,111
We have to get out of here. Now.

1151
02:04:08,816 --> 02:04:10,682
I have dreamed a dream...

1152
02:04:13,738 --> 02:04:17,106
...but now that dream
has gone from me.

1153
02:04:28,169 --> 02:04:30,411
Here they come.

1154
02:04:30,672 --> 02:04:32,379
Let's go, Morpheus.

1155
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:36,838
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

1156
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:47,553
- Come on!
- Something's different.

1157
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:49,722
What?

1158
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:51,891
I can feel them.

1159
02:05:14,841 --> 02:05:16,423
Neo!

1160
02:05:22,598 --> 02:05:26,182
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1161
02:05:31,441 --> 02:05:33,353
It's the <i>Hammer.</i>

1162
02:05:45,038 --> 02:05:47,746
He's in some kind of coma...

1163
02:05:47,915 --> 02:05:50,157
...but his vitals are stable.

1164
02:05:51,377 --> 02:05:53,289
What about you?

1165
02:05:53,463 --> 02:05:55,580
I'm fine.

1166
02:05:55,757 --> 02:05:58,124
You could use some rest.

1167
02:05:58,301 --> 02:06:00,133
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

1168
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:09,843
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

1169
02:06:10,021 --> 02:06:12,889
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

1170
02:06:13,066 --> 02:06:15,809
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

1171
02:06:16,069 --> 02:06:19,483
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

1172
02:06:19,822 --> 02:06:22,360
...until someone screwed it up.

1173
02:06:22,533 --> 02:06:25,150
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

1174
02:06:25,328 --> 02:06:27,194
Five ships were instantly downed.

1175
02:06:27,371 --> 02:06:29,158
When the machines broke through...

1176
02:06:29,332 --> 02:06:32,541
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

1177
02:06:32,710 --> 02:06:35,544
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

1178
02:06:35,713 --> 02:06:38,171
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

1179
02:06:38,341 --> 02:06:40,082
Who?

1180
02:06:40,259 --> 02:06:43,969
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

1181
02:06:44,138 --> 02:06:46,425
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

1182
02:06:46,641 --> 02:06:47,722
You found one?

1183
02:06:49,477 --> 02:06:51,184
Only one.

1184
02:16:44,279 --> 02:16:47,568
<i>Everything that has a beginning...</i>

1185
02:16:47,741 --> 02:16:49,448
<i>...has an end.</i>

1186
02:16:51,870 --> 02:16:54,738
<i>I see the end coming.</i>

1187
02:16:54,915 --> 02:16:58,704
<i>I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.</i>

1188
02:17:00,838 --> 02:17:03,831
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

1189
02:17:04,007 --> 02:17:05,999
We missed you.

1190
02:17:06,176 --> 02:17:08,008
It ends tonight.

1191
02:17:15,227 --> 02:17:18,345
<i>You are all that stands in his way.</i>

1192
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:24,480
<i>If you cannot stop him tonight,
then I fear that tomorrow may never come.</i>
