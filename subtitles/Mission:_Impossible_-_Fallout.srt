<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all a front for her real trade:
arms dealing, money laundering.</font>

269
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Extensive political connections
provide her with protection.</font>

270
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lark and the Widow
are meeting tonight</font>

271
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to negotiate delivery
of an unspecified package,</font>

272
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:03,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which we can only assume
is our missing plutonium.</font>

273
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll make contact in a private lounge
at the Grand Palais in Paris</font>

274
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:08,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">during her annual
fundraising event.</font>

275
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The details are in the file.</font>

276
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Lark isn't there by midnight,</font>

277
00:18:11,214 --> 00:18:13,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Widow will leave</font>

278
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and sell the package
to the highest bidder.</font>

279
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which gives you
2 hours from now to find Lark.</font>

280
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I think there's something
you need to know.</font>

281
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna stop you right there.</font>

282
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had a terrible choice
to make in Berlin:</font>

283
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Recover the plutonium or save your team.</font>

284
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:29,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You chose your team,
and now the world is at risk.</font>

285
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:33,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some flaw deep in your core being</font>

286
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:36,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">simply won't allow you to choose
between one life and millions.</font>

287
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see that as a sign of weakness.</font>

288
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To me, that's your greatest strength.</font>

289
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It also tells me I can count on you
to cover my ass.</font>

290
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:47,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because coming over here from the CIA
was a lateral move, some say a step down.</font>

291
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I did it</font>

292
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:50,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because of you.</font>

293
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't make me regret it.</font>

294
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make the call.</font>

295
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:11,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut 'em down.</font>

296
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think you're doing, Erika?</font>

297
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:24,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It may be your mission,</font>

298
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:27,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but this is the CIA's plane.</font>

299
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't take off without my say-so.</font>

300
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have time for this.</font>

301
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:33,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a team in Paris ready to grab Lark
as soon as he leaves the Palais.</font>

302
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A G5 standing by
to rendition him to Gitmo,</font>

303
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:38,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where a waterboard is waiting.</font>

304
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spend 24 hours we don't have
to pull a confession we can't trust</font>

305
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from a man we haven't
positively identified? No.</font>

306
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need reliable intelligence,
and we need it now.</font>

307
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This scenario is precisely
why the IMF exists!</font>

308
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:52,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The IMF is Halloween, Alan.</font>

309
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:56,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A bunch of grown men in rubber masks
playing trick-or-treat.</font>

310
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if he had held on to
the plutonium in Berlin,</font>

311
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we wouldn't be having
this conversation.</font>

312
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And his team would be dead.</font>

313
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:04,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. They would.</font>

314
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the job.</font>

315
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:09,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's why I want
one of my own men on the scene</font>

316
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to appraise the situation.</font>

317
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Agent Walker,
Special Activities.</font>

318
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:17,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His reputation precedes.</font>

319
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You use a scalpel.</font>

320
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:21,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I prefer a hammer.</font>

321
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The answer is no.</font>

322
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have operational authority here,
direct from the President.</font>

323
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:26,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a problem with that,
you take it up with him.</font>

324
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:30,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have already, and he agrees
with me. My man goes</font>

325
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or no one goes.</font>

326
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one comes between
you and that plutonium.</font>

327
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not Hunt, not his team, not anyone.</font>

328
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The White Widow has spies
at every level of government.</i></font>

329
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This plane is posing
as a commercial airliner</font>

330
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so we can jump into France undetected.</font>

331
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Widow's meeting Lark
in the VIP lounge at midnight.</font>

332
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:18,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one will be admitted
without a pre-issued electronic l.D. band.</font>

333
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:20,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have acquired
the unique RFID number</font>

334
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:22,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for Lark's band,
allowing us to locate it</font>

335
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:24,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with these.</font>

336
00:21:25,074 --> 00:21:27,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find that l.D. band, you find Lark.</font>

337
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what?</font>

338
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then...</font>

339
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I assume his identity
and make contact with the Widow.</font>

340
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She takes us to the package.</font>

341
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People actually fall for this shit?</font>

342
00:21:43,426 --> 00:21:45,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you intend to make Lark cooperate?</font>

343
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bump him in the crowd.</font>

344
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In 10 seconds he'll look like
any other drunk at the party,</font>

345
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:54,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">incoherent and completely pliable.</font>

346
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After I borrow his face,</font>

347
00:21:56,272 --> 00:21:58,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you walk him out the front door
and hand him to Sloane's extraction team.</font>

348
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not getting rid of me
that easily, Hunt.</font>

349
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not what this is about.</font>

350
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure it is.</font>

351
00:22:04,864 --> 00:22:07,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you don't want me
on this detail.</font>

352
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:09,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But let's face it:</font>

353
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you'd made
the hard choice in Berlin,</font>

354
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't be here.</font>

355
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you hadn't gunned down</font>

357
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't be here.</font>

358
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:20,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right, I know all about you.</font>

359
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:23,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're why we don't have a living witness
who can identify John Lark</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">or the Apostles.</font>

What are you doing here?</font>

That's it.</font>

00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:12,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want some. too?</font>

442
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not here by accident. Who sent you?</font>

443
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't tell you that.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a date with the White Widow.</font>

You look nothing like him.</font>

447
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now we have to hope
they never met.</font>

448
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:29,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hope is not a strategy!
- Oh, you must be new.</font>

449
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no other choice.</font>

00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:32,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The White Widow's our only lead.</font>

451
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got to be this guy for 5 minutes.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't do it.
- What?</font>

453
00:34:36,198 --> 00:34:38,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?
What aren't you telling me?</font>

454
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:40,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't understand
what you're involved in.</font>

455
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand
what I'm involved in.</font>

456
00:34:42,454 --> 00:34:44,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand
what I'm involved in?</font>

457
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:48,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I involved in?</font>

458
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:51,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're meeting the Widow,
she leaves in 3 minutes.</font>

00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:54,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ethan!
- I'll make it work.</font>

460

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ethan!
- I'll make it work.</font>

461
00:34:59,221 --> 00:35:00,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The name's Walker.</font>

462
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:02,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? You're welcome.</font>

463
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:22,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think you're doing?</font>

464
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm going with you.
- Like hell you are.</font>

465
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:25,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People have been sent here to kill Lark.</font>

466
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:26,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No shit.</font>

467
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:29,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not me. Contractors. Paid assassins.</font>

468
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't know what he looks like,</font>

469
00:35:30,919 --> 00:35:32,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they only know he's meeting
the Widow at midnight.</font>

470
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you go through with this,</font>

471
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:36,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they're gonna believe you're Lark
and they're gonna kill you.</font>

472
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know all this?</font>

473
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't tell you that.</font>

474
00:35:43,557 --> 00:35:45,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should've stayed out of the game.</font>

475
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should've come with me.</font>

476
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This charity was started
in honor of my mother.</font>

477
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:05,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those of you who knew her
understood her strength,</font>

478
00:36:05,412 --> 00:36:08,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">her tenacity, her resourcefulness.</font>

479
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:12,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there was another side to her,</font>

480
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a side most people never saw.</font>

481
00:36:14,421 --> 00:36:17,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is that part of her spirit
that has brought us</font>

482
00:36:17,966 --> 00:36:19,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all together tonight.</font>

483
00:36:20,427 --> 00:36:23,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Max was something of a paradox.</font>

484
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She had a fascination for paradoxes,</font>

485
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a fascination she passed on to me.</font>

486
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Max had no illusions about
the world we live in today.</font>

487
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she had dreams
of a very different future.</font>

488
00:36:42,616 --> 00:36:46,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One in which her unique talents
were no longer required.</font>

489
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:49,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All she earned from the way the world is</font>

490
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:53,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">went ultimately to making it
what it could someday be.</font>

491
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That future isn't here yet.</font>

492
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tonight, your contributions
have brought it just a little closer.</font>

493
00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:08,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you all for coming.</font>

494
00:37:08,183 --> 00:37:09,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enjoy the party.</font>

495
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:33,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't possibly be John Lark.</font>

496
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not, actually.</font>

497
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:41,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an alias.</font>

498
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:45,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suppose it's better than John Doe.</font>

499
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there another name you prefer?</font>

500
00:37:47,222 --> 00:37:48,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there somewhere
we could talk privately?</font>

501
00:37:49,057 --> 00:37:51,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact I like "Lark."
It does have a certain ring.</font>

502
00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:52,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have a lot of time.</font>

503
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:54,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I'll be honest.</font>

504
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A man of your reputation,
I was expecting someone</font>

505
00:37:56,982 --> 00:37:58,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">uglier.</font>

506
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let looks deceive.
I'm as ugly as they come.</font>

507
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'll be honest with you.
Your life is in danger.</font>

508
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:07,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you touch her.</font>

509
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:09,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax. It's my brother.</font>

510
00:38:10,662 --> 00:38:12,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're being rude to our guest, Zola.</font>

511
00:38:12,831 --> 00:38:14,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time to go.</font>

512
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't turn this into a scene.</font>

513
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:20,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want to be with this one.</font>

514
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You were saying?
- Your life is in danger.</font>

515
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who would want to kill me?</font>

516
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Americans, for starters.</font>

517
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If that were true, I would know it.</font>

518
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you're the only one
with spies in the government?</font>

519
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are people here
who don't want this meeting to happen.</font>

520
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't believe me?</font>

521
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look around.</font>

522
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:58,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you're thinking.</font>

523
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe they're not here for you.</font>

524
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:02,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe they're just here for me.</font>

525
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:05,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you willing to take that chance?</font>

526
00:39:06,134 --> 00:39:08,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have something I want.</font>

527
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now, that makes me
the only person you can trust</font>

528
00:39:10,764 --> 00:39:12,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to get you out of here alive.</font>

529
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or would you rather leave that
to your brother?</font>

530
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:23,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'd like
to go home now, Mr. Lark.</font>

531
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The French government took receipt
of the asset at noon today.</font>

00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will transport him via this route.</font>

536
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll create a diversion
at this intersection, here.</font>

537
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:56,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The motorcade will automatically take
the pre-planned alternate route here,</font>

538
00:41:57,222 --> 00:41:59,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where we'll extract the asset.</font>

539
00:42:00,475 --> 00:42:02,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Extract the asset?</font>

540
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The asset.</font>

541
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We paid a great deal of money
for this information.</font>

542
00:42:19,786 --> 00:42:22,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They gave us everything
but this man's name.</font>

543
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:25,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't happen to know
who he is, do you?</font>

544
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His name is Solomon Lane.</font>

545
00:42:27,961 --> 00:42:30,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">British Special Agent turned anarchist.</font>

546
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:33,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He used rogue covert operatives</font>

547
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to create a terror network
called the Syndicate.</font>

548
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sabotage, assassination, mass murder.</font>

549
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As ugly as they come.</font>

550
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:46,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was captured by American agents
2 years ago.</font>

551
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:49,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since then, he's been in
a never-ending interrogation,</font>

552
00:42:49,691 --> 00:42:51,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">passed around from
one government to another</font>

553
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:55,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to answer for his crimes.</font>

554
00:42:58,241 --> 00:42:59,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You seem displeased, Lark.</font>

555
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.</font>

556
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:06,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I came to Paris for plutonium.</font>

557
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there must be a misunderstanding.</font>

558
00:43:09,669 --> 00:43:11,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just a broker.</font>

559
00:43:11,671 --> 00:43:13,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I connect a buyer and a seller.</font>

560
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:18,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My seller's not interested in cash,
so if you want the plutonium...</font>

561
00:43:19,012 --> 00:43:20,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Extract Lane</font>

562
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:22,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and make a trade.</font>

563
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

564
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do I know the seller has what I want?</font>

565
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A down payment in good faith.</font>

566
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A courier will deliver
two more within 48 hours</font>

567
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in exchange for him.</font>

568
00:44:07,727 --> 00:44:08,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

569
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:11,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens after the diversion?</font>

570
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:46,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill everyone?</font>

571
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's your plan?</font>

572
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There will be no witnesses.</font>

573
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:53,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's my guarantee that Lane
walks out of this thing alive?</font>

574
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's in an armored box.</font>

575
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll pull him out when it's safe.</font>

576
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want your plutonium,</font>

577
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is the price.</font>

578
00:46:04,427 --> 00:46:06,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or do you draw the line at killing cops?</font>

579
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's John Lark you're talking to.</font>

580
00:46:12,185 --> 00:46:15,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I murder women and children
with smallpox.</font>

581
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no line.</font>

582
00:46:23,613 --> 00:46:24,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

583
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sleep well, everyone. Busy day tomorrow.</font>

584
00:46:48,221 --> 00:46:50,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You have got to be kidding me.</i></font>

585
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want Lane out of prison,
this is how it gets done.</font>

586
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted Lark to break him out,
not Ethan Hunt.</font>

587
00:46:56,313 --> 00:47:00,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted Lark at the exchange,
not Ethan Hunt.</font>

588
00:47:00,608 --> 00:47:03,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted Lark to lead us
to the plutonium</font>

589
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the Apostles.</font>

590
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may still get your chance.</font>

591
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you forgotten about
the corpse we pulled</font>

592
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:10,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">out of the men's room at the Grand Palais?</font>

593
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:12,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm guessing that wasn't Lark.</font>

594
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More likely one of Lark's recruits.</font>

595
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:15,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not according to our intelligence.</font>

596
00:47:16,207 --> 00:47:18,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Intelligence gathered by whom?</font>

597
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunt.</font>

598
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:26,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've long held suspicions that Lark
was an American agent.</font>

599
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone who knew our every move.</font>

600
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:30,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone who could
come and go like a ghost.</font>

601
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:34,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're suggesting Hunt is John Lark.</font>

602
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:39,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're reaching, Walker.
Trying to save your ass.</font>

603
00:47:39,647 --> 00:47:41,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It won't work.</font>

604
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think about it.
Would a man as careful as Lark</font>

605
00:47:44,652 --> 00:47:46,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">really stick his neck out like that?</font>

606
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For a face-to-face with the White Widow?</font>

607
00:47:49,115 --> 00:47:51,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He'd send a proxy.
- A decoy.</font>

608
00:47:51,826 --> 00:47:53,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if he was really smart,</font>

609
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:56,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he'd have his lady friend kill that decoy</font>

610
00:47:56,247 --> 00:47:58,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in front of a reliable witness.</font>

611
00:47:58,249 --> 00:47:59,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me.</font>

612
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The dragnet is closing in
on his terrorist alter ego.</font>

613
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he pays a man
to play the part of Lark</font>

614
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:06,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and has him killed.</font>

615
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And under the guise
of serving his country...</font>

616
00:48:10,553 --> 00:48:12,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Assumes his own secret identity.</font>

617
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:14,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Free to operate at will</font>

618
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the full support
of the U.S. government.</font>

619
00:48:16,434 --> 00:48:17,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

620
00:48:18,144 --> 00:48:19,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would Hunt turn?</font>

621
00:48:20,313 --> 00:48:23,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did Lane do it?
Why did any of his Apostles?</font>

622
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were believers in a cause.</font>

623
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:29,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when that cause
turned out to be a lie,</font>

624
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:32,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they turned
against their masters.</font>

625
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:35,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many times has Hunt's
government betrayed him,</font>

626
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">disavowed him, cast him aside?</font>

627
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how long before
a man like that</font>

628
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:42,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has had enough?</font>

629
00:48:43,002 --> 00:48:45,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is a serious accusation.</font>

630
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you prove it?</font>

631
00:48:52,595 --> 00:48:54,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the phone
we pulled off the dead body</font>

632
00:48:54,472 --> 00:48:55,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the Grand Palais.</font>

633
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm guessing
it has all the proof you need.</font>

634
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it true Lane gassed
a village of 2,000 people?</font>

635
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

636
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it true he brought down
an entire passenger plane</font>

637
00:51:16,864 --> 00:51:17,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just to kill one man?</font>

638
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:20,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

639
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it true that he...
- Hey, Walker.</font>

640
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever you heard,
if it makes your skin crawl,</font>

641
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's probably true.</font>

642
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

643
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the guy
that caught him, aren't you?</font>

644
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:42,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long do you think</font>

645
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's gonna keep that
to himself?</font>

646
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.</font>

647
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is he doing?</font>

648
00:56:34,098 --> 00:56:35,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunt? Where are you?</font>

649
00:56:35,766 --> 00:56:37,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't wait for me!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Benji, do you copy?</font>

653
00:56:53,534 --> 00:56:54,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We copy. Go.</font>

654
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:58,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Change of plan. I'm blown.
Need extraction.</i></font>

St. Louis bridge. Units are in pursuit...</font>

657
01:01:39,778 --> 01:01:40,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

658

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay where you are.</font>

659
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:44,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in the car.</font>

660
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:46,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody move.</font>

661
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:51,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me your hands.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just walk away... please.</font>

668
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,149

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be all right.</font>

672
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got to go.</font>

673
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.</font>

674
01:03:08,575 --> 01:03:09,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

675
01:03:45,904 --> 01:03:47,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The name's Walker, by the way.</font>

676
01:03:48,073 --> 01:03:50,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was the little car your idea?</font>

677
01:04:00,252 --> 01:04:01,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ!</font>

678
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell was that?</font>

679
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Everybody out.
- Go, go, go!</font>

680
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:50,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was Ilsa.</font>

681
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up.</font>

682
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very interesting.</font>

683
01:06:58,388 --> 01:07:00,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good to see you again, Ethan.</font>

684
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, look who's still alive.</font>

685
01:07:44,184 --> 01:07:45,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a microwave tracker in his neck.</font>

686
01:07:46,061 --> 01:07:47,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it. You know what to do.</font>

687
01:07:47,771 --> 01:07:49,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me just assure you, this won't hurt</font>

688
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:51,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">enough.</font>

689
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:56,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">90 seconds.</font>

690
01:07:56,196 --> 01:07:58,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and your Apostles think
we're gonna trade you</font>

691
01:07:58,156 --> 01:07:59,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the missing plutonium.</font>

692
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:02,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here to tell you
that's never gonna happen.</font>

693
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:06,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Your mission, should you
choose to accept it."</font>

694
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder, Ethan,</font>

695
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:10,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">did you ever choose not to?</font>

696
01:08:11,211 --> 01:08:12,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you ever stop and ask yourself</font>

697
01:08:12,879 --> 01:08:15,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who it was giving you the orders or why?</font>

698
01:08:16,508 --> 01:08:20,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While every day the master you serve
moves one step closer to ending the world.</font>

699
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:23,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strange accusation
coming from a terrorist.</font>

700
01:08:23,181 --> 01:08:24,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">60 seconds.</font>

701
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:26,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Terrorists are schoolboys
desperate for attention,</font>

702
01:08:26,518 --> 01:08:30,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hoping to shape
public opinion through fear.</font>

703
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:33,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care in the least
what people think or feel.</font>

704
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:36,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my experience,
they don't do either for very long.</font>

705
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and I suppose that
justifies bombing factories</font>

706
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or bringing down civilian aircraft.</font>

707
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or strapping me
into an explosive vest!</font>

708
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:45,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Consider it unfinished business,
my funny little friend.</font>

709
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:47,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Luther?
- Almost there.</font>

710
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see the end as clearly as I do, Ethan.</font>

711
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:53,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Governments the world over
are descending into madness.</font>

712
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:57,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Syndicate was created
to tear them down, brick by brick.</font>

713
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Syndicate was
a pack of murdering cowards.</font>

714
01:08:59,384 --> 01:09:03,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Syndicate
was civilization's last hope!</font>

715
01:09:03,138 --> 01:09:06,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A chance to smash the old world order.</font>

716
01:09:06,933 --> 01:09:08,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That hope is gone now
because of you</font>

717
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:11,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and your pathetic morality.</font>

718
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:15,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have killed me, Ethan.</font>

719
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:20,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The end you've always feared</font>

720
01:09:20,697 --> 01:09:22,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is coming.</font>

721
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:26,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's coming!</font>

722
01:09:27,954 --> 01:09:30,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the blood will be on your hands.</font>

723
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fallout</font>

724
01:09:35,295 --> 01:09:38,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of all your good intentions.</font>

725
01:09:44,554 --> 01:09:46,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Time.
- Got it.</font>

726
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:12,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him up.</font>

727
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:16,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're mine now.</font>

728
01:10:25,929 --> 01:10:28,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're just full of surprises, Lark.</font>

729
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:30,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your brother's plan
was bad from the word go.</font>

730
01:10:30,934 --> 01:10:32,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd have lost all your men</font>

731
01:10:32,936 --> 01:10:34,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Lane would've been killed
in the crossfire.</font>

732
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:37,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to improvise.</font>

733
01:10:37,607 --> 01:10:40,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, why not say that in the first place?</font>

734
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:42,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I don't trust your people.</font>

735
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:44,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially not your brother.</font>

736
01:10:48,034 --> 01:10:51,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Family. What can you do?</font>

737
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:56,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, where's Lane?</font>

738
01:10:56,084 --> 01:10:58,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Certainly not at the bottom
of the Seine.</font>

739
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have him. He's safe.</font>

740
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do I meet the courier?</font>

741
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:05,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's talk about the woman.</font>

742
01:11:07,971 --> 01:11:09,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Woman?</font>

743
01:11:09,389 --> 01:11:10,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was with you at the Palais.</font>

744
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zola saw her again today.</font>

745
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:13,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She tried to kill Lane.</font>

746
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She had the chance to kill you,
but she didn't.</font>

747
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:17,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

748
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:23,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a past.</font>

749
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:25,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's complicated.</font>

750
01:11:27,949 --> 01:11:30,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'll make it
more complicated for you.</font>

751
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My price just went up.</font>

752
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:35,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone killed 4 of my men today.</font>

753
01:11:35,123 --> 01:11:36,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm assuming it was her.</font>

754
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:44,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want her, Lark.</font>

755
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're gonna bring her to me.</font>

756
01:11:48,553 --> 01:11:50,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise, you don't meet the courier</font>

757
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:52,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the plutonium goes
to the highest bidder.</font>

758
01:11:54,267 --> 01:11:56,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd hate for her
to come between us.</font>

759
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:02,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's yours.</font>

760
01:12:03,026 --> 01:12:05,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At the meeting. Not before.</font>

761
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to London.</font>

762
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:22,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Instructions will follow.</font>

763
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:06,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew if I followed her,
you'd show up eventually.</font>

764
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

765
01:14:10,528 --> 01:14:11,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ilsa, I never wanted to hurt you.</font>

766
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:14,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you have your reasons.</font>

767
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:15,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

768
01:14:19,871 --> 01:14:21,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to walk away.</font>

769
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:22,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do that.</font>

770
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:27,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You weren't at the Palais to kill Lark.</font>

771
01:14:27,295 --> 01:14:28,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

772
01:14:30,256 --> 01:14:31,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were there to protect him.</font>

773
01:14:32,467 --> 01:14:33,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

774
01:14:33,593 --> 01:14:35,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you killed him to protect me.</font>

775
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:40,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanted Lark to break Lane out.</font>

776
01:14:41,768 --> 01:14:45,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You needed him to break Lane out.</font>

777
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you have to kill Lane.</font>

778
01:14:49,317 --> 01:14:51,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's making you do this?</font>

779
01:14:52,904 --> 01:14:54,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MI6.</font>

780
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:58,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

781
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:00,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After we captured him in London,</font>

782
01:15:00,286 --> 01:15:03,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they tried to bring Lane home
through diplomatic channels.</font>

783
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:06,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But too many countries
want their pound of flesh.</font>

784
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:08,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A man like that, what he's seen,</font>

785
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what he knows about British Intelligence,</font>

786
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:13,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they can't have him talking
to a foreign government ever.</font>

787
01:15:13,466 --> 01:15:15,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not what I'm asking.</font>

788
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:17,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did they send you?</font>

789
01:15:18,513 --> 01:15:20,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is how I prove my loyalty.</font>

790
01:15:21,641 --> 01:15:23,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is how I come home.</font>

791
01:15:23,226 --> 01:15:25,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you were out.</font>

792
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:26,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were free.</font>

793
01:15:26,604 --> 01:15:28,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are never free.</font>

794
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:31,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spent 2 years undercover with Lane.</font>

795
01:15:32,068 --> 01:15:34,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To them, I'm as much of a threat as he is.</font>

796
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:39,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I kill him, or I never stop running.</font>

797
01:15:41,619 --> 01:15:44,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now tell me where he is.</font>

798
01:15:48,668 --> 01:15:50,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't help you.</font>

799
01:15:50,628 --> 01:15:53,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will get to him one way or another.</font>

800
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:56,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't make me go through you.</font>

801
01:16:52,982 --> 01:16:54,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

802
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:55,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Are you here in London?</i></font>

803
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:57,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I am.</i></font>

804
01:16:57,445 --> 01:16:59,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you ready to meet the courier?</font>

805
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yes. Where do I go?</i></font>

806
01:17:02,617 --> 01:17:04,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where would you like to meet?</font>

807
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:43,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Secretary.</font>

808
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:46,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I prayed to God that it wasn't true.</font>

809
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, in his defense, sir,</font>

810
01:17:48,496 --> 01:17:49,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if Ethan hadn't intervened,</font>

811
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:51,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a great many people
would have been killed.</font>

812
01:17:51,457 --> 01:17:53,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Dunn, I'm sure that
the good people of Paris</font>

813
01:17:53,793 --> 01:17:56,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the nation of France as a whole
will take that into account.</font>

814
01:17:58,089 --> 01:17:59,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what the hell happened?</font>

815
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:21,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...at which point, we were
told to come to London</font>

816
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:23,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and await further instructions.</font>

817
01:18:23,907 --> 01:18:25,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what happens now?</font>

818
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now,</font>

819
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:29,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we meet the Widow in 20 minutes.</font>

820
01:18:29,829 --> 01:18:31,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll take us to a courier</font>

821
01:18:31,414 --> 01:18:34,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who'll hand over our missing plutonium
in exchange for Solomon Lane.</font>

822
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:36,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or, in our scenario,</font>

823
01:18:37,378 --> 01:18:38,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Benji.</font>

824
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:40,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus.</font>

825
01:18:40,548 --> 01:18:41,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, what?</font>

826
01:18:41,674 --> 01:18:43,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luther and I are gonna
take you to the courier.</font>

827
01:18:43,301 --> 01:18:44,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walker stays here
and guards the real Lane.</font>

828
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely not.</font>

829
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:47,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait.
Why do I have to be Lane?</font>

830
01:18:47,597 --> 01:18:48,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Benji.</font>

831
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:51,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our mission, my mission,
is to recover that plutonium,</font>

832
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:53,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I will do so at any cost.</font>

833
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:55,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if I have to trade Lane.</font>

834
01:18:55,521 --> 01:18:56,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The real Lane.</font>

835
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I will never let him go.</font>

836
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:02,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When the Apostles realize
that you're playing games,</font>

837
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'll lose the plutonium. Again.</font>

838
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:06,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You let us worry about the Apostles.</font>

839
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:09,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As it stands, we have a bigger problem.</font>

840
01:19:09,202 --> 01:19:10,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A bigger problem?</font>

841
01:19:11,412 --> 01:19:12,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ilsa.
- Ilsa?</font>

842
01:19:12,997 --> 01:19:14,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our Ilsa? Ilsa Faust Ilsa?</font>

843
01:19:14,624 --> 01:19:15,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is she mixed up in all of this?</font>

844
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:18,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's been ordered
to kill Lane. Direct from Ml6.</font>

845
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:21,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, wait. So that was her
in Paris? On the bike.</font>

846
01:19:21,756 --> 01:19:22,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

847
01:19:22,882 --> 01:19:24,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan, she tried to kill us!</font>

848
01:19:24,175 --> 01:19:25,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, not us. Not us.
- Yeah.</font>

849
01:19:25,468 --> 01:19:27,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lane. She tried to kill Lane.
She has no choice.</font>

850
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:28,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she will kill me!</font>

851
01:19:29,013 --> 01:19:30,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna let that happen.</font>

852
01:19:30,139 --> 01:19:32,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan, how exactly are you
not gonna let that happen?</font>

853
01:19:33,726 --> 01:19:35,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm working on it.
- Oh, he's working on it.</font>

854
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:37,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now, we don't have a lot of time.</font>

855
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to get ready for this meeting.</font>

856
01:19:39,023 --> 01:19:40,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The meeting is a trap.</font>

857
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:43,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The White Widow is working with the CIA.</font>

858
01:19:43,861 --> 01:19:45,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She has been since the beginning.</font>

859
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:49,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bargaining for immunity
is her stock-in-trade.</font>

860
01:19:49,409 --> 01:19:51,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Capturing the plutonium,
and the Apostles, and John Lark</font>

861
01:19:52,036 --> 01:19:54,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">buys her a lot of goodwill
with the Americans.</font>

862
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:57,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if Sloane knew the meeting was a trap,
why didn't she just tell us?</font>

863
01:19:57,542 --> 01:19:59,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because, in her mind,
anybody could be John Lark,</font>

864
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:01,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">including one of us.</font>

865
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:04,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now her suspicions are confirmed.</font>

866
01:20:07,176 --> 01:20:08,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">According to that dossier,</font>

867
01:20:08,678 --> 01:20:11,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a trail of electronic evidence
connects Hunt</font>

868
01:20:11,472 --> 01:20:14,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the theft of smallpox from the CDC.</font>

869
01:20:14,475 --> 01:20:16,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It also links him
to a lengthy correspondence</font>

870
01:20:16,936 --> 01:20:18,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ending with the recruitment
of Dr. Delbruuk.</font>

871
01:20:19,063 --> 01:20:21,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, of course,
Hunt handed over the plutonium</font>

872
01:20:21,482 --> 01:20:23,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the Apostles himself.</font>

873
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:25,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, those facts, coupled with</font>

874
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:28,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a long and incriminating
history of rogue behavior,</font>

875
01:20:28,489 --> 01:20:30,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">corroborate a CIA narrative</font>

876
01:20:31,826 --> 01:20:33,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Hunt has snapped.</font>

877
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:36,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that his search for Lark
is nothing but a cover</font>

878
01:20:36,372 --> 01:20:38,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to hide the fact that Lark...</font>

879
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:40,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...is me.</font>

880
01:20:42,545 --> 01:20:44,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got to hand it to you, Ethan.</font>

881
01:20:44,839 --> 01:20:47,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Normally, when people refer to you
as your own worst enemy,</font>

882
01:20:47,258 --> 01:20:48,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's just a figure of speech.</font>

883
01:20:53,514 --> 01:20:56,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid Sloane's got
some questions for her as well.</font>

884
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:59,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Widow offered her up
at no extra charge.</font>

885
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:02,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And where did Sloane get this information?</font>

886
01:21:03,274 --> 01:21:04,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She didn't say.</font>

887
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:07,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She did, however,
grant me the opportunity to bring you in,</font>

888
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the condition that
I terminate this mission</font>

889
01:21:10,281 --> 01:21:12,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and hand over
Solomon Lane personally.</font>

890
01:21:13,117 --> 01:21:14,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir, you can't do that.
- Hunt</font>

891
01:21:14,952 --> 01:21:17,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know Lane. And he has
no intention of going back.</font>

892
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:18,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why we're taking him back.</font>

893
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which means that's exactly
what he wants us to do.</font>

894
01:21:22,251 --> 01:21:23,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ethan...
- Sir, what do you</font>

895
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:24,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">think this is? A coincidence?</font>

896
01:21:24,712 --> 01:21:25,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That someone just happened upon this?</font>

897
01:21:25,838 --> 01:21:28,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lane had it sent to her.
He knew how she would react.</font>

898
01:21:28,549 --> 01:21:30,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like he knew
the Widow would turn us in.</font>

899
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:31,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you see?</font>

900
01:21:31,844 --> 01:21:33,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This, sir...</font>

901
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:35,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the trap.</font>

902
01:21:35,515 --> 01:21:37,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We are being directed.
- Hunt</font>

903
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:40,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are still two plutonium cores
in the wind!</font>

904
01:21:40,144 --> 01:21:42,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you lost them!</font>

905
01:21:44,273 --> 01:21:46,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fairness, sir, we all lost them.</font>

906
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:50,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Respectfully, sir, you weren't there.</font>

907
01:21:50,196 --> 01:21:52,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So making excuses for him
is your full-time job now?</font>

908
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good God, Ethan, don't make this
any harder than it already is.</font>

909
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:00,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can no longer protect you,
don't you understand that?</font>

910
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:03,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is as close as
you're ever gonna get to that plutonium.</font>

911
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:05,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, you don't actually believe this.</font>

912
01:22:05,294 --> 01:22:07,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe I've been given
a choice to protect you</font>

913
01:22:07,713 --> 01:22:09,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or the IMF, which is why
I'm bringing you in.</font>

914
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:12,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if I refuse?</font>

915
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:15,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think he's here for?</font>

916
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:16,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think he's some observer?</font>

917
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:17,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's an assassin!</font>

918
01:22:17,974 --> 01:22:20,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Erika Sloane's number-1 plumber.</font>

919
01:22:20,601 --> 01:22:23,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You go rogue, he's authorized
to hunt you down</font>

920
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and kill you.</font>

921
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:31,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the job.
No hard feelings.</font>

922
01:22:31,654 --> 01:22:33,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Accept it, Ethan.</font>

923
01:22:33,322 --> 01:22:35,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've lost this one.
What's done is done.</font>

924
01:22:37,326 --> 01:22:39,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, sir. No.</font>

925
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:42,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not asking you.
I am giving you a direct order.</font>

926
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:45,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This mission is terminated.</font>

927
01:22:46,002 --> 01:22:47,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now!</font>

928
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:51,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stickell, he's your friend.</font>

929
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:52,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you please talk
some sense into...</font>

930
01:22:55,928 --> 01:22:58,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, sir,
but you left me no choice.</font>

931
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:02,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's 15 minutes
before we meet the Widow.</font>

932
01:23:02,685 --> 01:23:04,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want the plutonium,
we're the only ones</font>

933
01:23:04,353 --> 01:23:06,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who can get it for you. You in or out?</font>

934
01:23:08,274 --> 01:23:09,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In.</font>

935
01:23:09,358 --> 01:23:11,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- Benji needs to get ready.</font>

936
01:23:11,777 --> 01:23:13,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Ethan...
- There's no time, Luther.</font>

937
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:15,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to trust me.</font>

938
01:23:32,381 --> 01:23:33,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right?</font>

939
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:35,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I just</font>

940
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:37,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">got a bad feeling about this one.</font>

941
01:24:03,704 --> 01:24:05,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't hear from us...</font>

942
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:07,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll do it my way.</font>

943
01:24:11,295 --> 01:24:13,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't take your eyes off him.</font>

944
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:51,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough games.
I'm taking you out of here.</font>

945
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:53,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Hunt?</font>

946
01:24:53,504 --> 01:24:55,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gone to the meeting,
with a copy of you.</font>

947
01:24:55,756 --> 01:24:56,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calm down.</font>

948
01:24:56,966 --> 01:24:58,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call the Apostles. Warn them.</font>

949
01:24:58,718 --> 01:25:00,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no way of contacting them.</font>

950
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:02,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For their safety and mine.</font>

951
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:03,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I do have is an extraction team with</font>

952
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:06,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">satellite overwatch
and a prearranged rendezvous.</font>

953
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:07,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll know as soon as
we leave the building.</font>

954
01:25:07,852 --> 01:25:10,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm staying here.</font>

955
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:12,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't finished with Hunt yet.</font>

956
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:19,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did you have to make this
so fucking complicated?</font>

957
01:25:20,364 --> 01:25:22,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand what you mean.</font>

958
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:23,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The deal was simple.</font>

959
01:25:23,951 --> 01:25:27,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I help you frame Hunt,
you give me the plutonium.</font>

960
01:25:27,246 --> 01:25:29,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're wasting time.</font>

961
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:32,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"There cannot be peace without
first a great suffering.</font>

962
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:35,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace."</font>

963
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:36,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I wrote those words,</font>

964
01:25:36,839 --> 01:25:41,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't referring to your peace
or Hunt's suffering.</font>

965
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:43,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The old world order
needs dismantling,</font>

966
01:25:43,387 --> 01:25:45,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we have the tools
to dismantle it.</font>

967
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:47,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All you seem to care about</font>

968
01:25:47,099 --> 01:25:49,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that Hunt lives to take the blame.</font>

969
01:25:49,852 --> 01:25:51,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not anarchy.</font>

970
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:53,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's revenge.</font>

971
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:54,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it is.</font>

972
01:25:55,232 --> 01:25:56,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when I have what I want,</font>

973
01:25:57,818 --> 01:26:00,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Apostles will give you the plutonium.</font>

974
01:26:04,241 --> 01:26:05,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunt's the only friend you've got.</font>

975
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:06,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're only alive today</font>

976
01:26:07,036 --> 01:26:09,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because he didn't have
the guts to kill you.</font>

977
01:26:09,121 --> 01:26:11,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sloane was right.
The IMF is Halloween.</font>

978
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:14,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing but grown men
wearing...</font>

979
01:26:21,425 --> 01:26:22,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

980
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just the job.
No hard feelings.</font>

981
01:26:35,564 --> 01:26:37,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've ruined your day, haven't I?</font>

982
01:26:41,195 --> 01:26:43,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you were doing so well
up until then.</font>

983
01:26:44,281 --> 01:26:46,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I think this one's loaded.</font>

984
01:26:46,575 --> 01:26:48,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to find out?</font>

985
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:33,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So, how'd I do?
- I never had a doubt.</font>

986
01:27:34,874 --> 01:27:37,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm beginning to see why
you guys enjoy this so much.</font>

987
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:39,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hats off, Mr. Secretary.</font>

988
01:27:39,253 --> 01:27:41,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The man's a natural.
- Welcome to the team, sir.</font>

989
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're making a mistake.</font>

990
01:27:44,967 --> 01:27:49,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, the mistake was mine
when I saved your life over Paris.</font>

991
01:27:49,388 --> 01:27:51,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This proves nothing.
I'm playing a role,</font>

992
01:27:52,057 --> 01:27:54,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just like you are, trying to
recover that plutonium.</font>

993
01:27:54,226 --> 01:27:56,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't explain why
you gave Sloane the dossier</font>

994
01:27:56,854 --> 01:27:58,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and tried to frame Hunt.</font>

995
01:27:58,189 --> 01:27:59,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He makes a good point,</font>

996
01:28:00,065 --> 01:28:01,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lark.</font>

997
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:03,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's paranoid. Delusional.</font>

998
01:28:04,069 --> 01:28:05,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like the dossier says.</font>

999
01:28:05,821 --> 01:28:07,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So where did Sloane get the dossier from?</font>

1000
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:09,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no idea.</font>

1001
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:11,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do.</font>

1002
01:28:13,829 --> 01:28:15,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you get all that, Erika?</font>

1003
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:16,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I did.</i></font>

1004
01:28:17,082 --> 01:28:19,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I don't appreciate being used, Walker.</i></font>

1005
01:28:21,337 --> 01:28:23,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad boy.</font>

1006
01:28:24,381 --> 01:28:25,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where would you like him delivered?</font>

1007
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:27,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll come to you.</font>

1008
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:32,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody move! Nobody move!</font>

1009
01:28:32,556 --> 01:28:34,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weapons down! Drop 'em!</font>

1010
01:28:34,433 --> 01:28:36,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hands in the air!
Weapons down!</font>

1011
01:28:37,269 --> 01:28:39,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop it! Drop it!</font>

1012
01:28:39,396 --> 01:28:40,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weapons down! Right now! You!</font>

1013
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:43,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's okay. It's all right.</font>

1014
01:28:44,276 --> 01:28:45,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought we had a deal.</font>

1015
01:28:45,986 --> 01:28:48,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We did. And now we don't.</i></font>

1016
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:51,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There is too much at stake here
for me to take any chances.</i></font>

1017
01:28:52,284 --> 01:28:54,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm bringing you all in,
along with Walker.</font>

1018
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The plutonium is still out there!</font>

1019
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:59,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't trust a living soul
in that room to get it.</font>

1020
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:02,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We'll sort out who's who in Washington.</i></font>

1021
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:04,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Erika!
- Sir?</font>

1022
01:29:05,381 --> 01:29:07,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.
Let's just do what she says.</font>

1023
01:29:08,759 --> 01:29:11,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only real threats are in this room,
and we have them.</font>

1024
01:29:14,598 --> 01:29:15,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you?</font>

1025
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:18,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>

1026
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:39,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the hell is Lane?</font>

1027
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:10,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan! Ethan!</font>

1028
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:37,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First team is down.
Send backup.</font>

1029
01:30:40,517 --> 01:30:41,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir!</font>

1030
01:30:42,853 --> 01:30:45,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, no.
Man down! Man down!</font>

1031
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:48,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody help!</font>

1032
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:59,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

1033
01:31:03,582 --> 01:31:06,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan, I tagged Walker,
but he's on the run.</font>

1034
01:31:06,168 --> 01:31:07,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got to get him.</font>

1035
01:31:12,424 --> 01:31:13,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>

1036
01:31:15,135 --> 01:31:16,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, sir.</font>

1037
01:31:18,597 --> 01:31:19,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>

1038
01:31:30,609 --> 01:31:31,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan?</font>

1039
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:37,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait!</font>

1040
01:31:38,784 --> 01:31:40,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get that son of a bitch.</font>

1041
01:32:09,106 --> 01:32:10,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on, come on.</font>

1042
01:32:11,066 --> 01:32:12,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! I got him.</font>

1043
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:24,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1044
01:32:25,789 --> 01:32:27,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talk to me, Benji. Where's Walker?</font>

1045
01:32:27,916 --> 01:32:29,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He's about a quarter mile west
if you turn right.</i></font>

1046
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:31,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To my right?</font>

1047
01:32:34,381 --> 01:32:35,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do that.</font>

1048
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:37,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Why not?</i></font>

1049
01:32:38,135 --> 01:32:39,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I'm being followed.</font>

1050
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:41,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What do you mean? By who?</i></font>

1051
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:43,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do I know?
CIA, Apostles...</font>

1052
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What difference does it make?</font>

1053
01:32:45,225 --> 01:32:48,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Okay, okay, just get out of there
and then go right.</i></font>

1054
01:32:56,028 --> 01:32:57,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am terribly sorry.</font>

1055
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

1056
01:33:16,632 --> 01:33:18,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is he running in circles?</font>

1057
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:47,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you need to cross the street
on your left as soon as you can.</font>

1058
01:33:53,585 --> 01:33:54,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Ethan, did you copy?</i></font>

1059
01:33:54,878 --> 01:33:57,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Left, go left, now!
- l'm working on it.</i></font>

1060
01:34:08,517 --> 01:34:10,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Now go across the street
right in front of you.</i></font>

1061
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:20,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Ethan, he's getting away from you!
You're gonna have to go faster.</i></font>

1062
01:34:52,394 --> 01:34:54,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gaining on him!
Go straight.</font>

1063
01:34:56,732 --> 01:34:58,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Straight? Keep going straight?</font>

1064
01:34:58,734 --> 01:35:00,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Go straight, go straight,
straight, straight.</i></font>

1065
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:03,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Okay, now turn right.</i></font>

1066
01:35:03,947 --> 01:35:04,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>

1067
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:06,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now?</font>

1068
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:08,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Yes, right!
- Are you sure?</i></font>

1069
01:35:08,493 --> 01:35:09,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I'm...</font>

1070
01:35:10,579 --> 01:35:11,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's left! Turn left!</font>

1071
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, I had the screen-lock on.</font>

1072
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:18,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Left.</font>

1073
01:35:22,382 --> 01:35:23,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1074

01:35:33,352 --> 01:35:35,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean,
you're jumping out of a...</font>

1076
01:35:37,272 --> 01:35:39,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, sorry. I had it in 2D.</font>

1077
01:35:39,358 --> 01:35:40,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck.</font>

1078
01:36:14,601 --> 01:36:16,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At the end of the bridge,
turn left. You've almost got him.</font>

1079
01:36:21,066 --> 01:36:23,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, Ethan, get him!</font>

1080
01:36:23,193 --> 01:36:24,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right on top of him!</font>

1081
01:36:39,251 --> 01:36:40,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it, he's right in front of you!</font>

1082
01:36:40,585 --> 01:36:41,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him! Get him! Get him!</font>

1083
01:37:17,873 --> 01:37:21,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't do it, can you?
Not until you get your plutonium.</font>

1084
01:37:22,294 --> 01:37:25,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. He still has plans for you.</font>

1085
01:37:26,631 --> 01:37:29,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna turn yourself in
and admit you're John Lark,</font>

1086
01:37:30,052 --> 01:37:33,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then watch the old world implode
from your dark little cell.</font>

1087
01:37:33,221 --> 01:37:34,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if I don't?</font>

1088
01:37:47,819 --> 01:37:49,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm her guardian angel, Hunt.</font>

1089
01:37:50,989 --> 01:37:53,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I see you again, she dies.</font>

1090
01:37:53,992 --> 01:37:56,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you try to warn her, she dies.</font>

1091
01:37:56,995 --> 01:37:58,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Know when you're beat.</font>

1092
01:39:09,818 --> 01:39:13,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are the designs we recovered
from Dr. Delbruuk's lab in Berlin.</font>

1093
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:15,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a 5-megaton nuclear device.</font>

1094
01:39:15,949 --> 01:39:17,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's greater than
all the explosive energy</font>

1095
01:39:17,659 --> 01:39:18,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">released in World War ll.</font>

1096
01:39:18,785 --> 01:39:22,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To disarm it, normally
we'd cut the fuse wire here.</font>

1097
01:39:22,539 --> 01:39:23,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, "normally"?</font>

1098
01:39:24,082 --> 01:39:26,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walker and Lane
have two plutonium cores,</font>

1099
01:39:27,002 --> 01:39:28,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">meaning two bombs.</font>

1100
01:39:28,712 --> 01:39:31,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. And they're both linked
by a microwave fail-safe</font>

1101
01:39:31,089 --> 01:39:32,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is accurate to
within one-tenth of a second.</font>

1102
01:39:32,966 --> 01:39:37,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any attempt to defuse one bomb
automatically triggers the other.</font>

1103
01:39:37,429 --> 01:39:40,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meaning once armed,
the bombs cannot be disarmed.</font>

1104
01:39:40,348 --> 01:39:43,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The countdown is
started by a remote detonator,</font>

1105
01:39:43,101 --> 01:39:45,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is also a fail-safe.</font>

1106
01:39:45,187 --> 01:39:47,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meaning once the countdown starts,</font>

1107
01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:49,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it can't be stopped.</font>

1108
01:39:51,067 --> 01:39:53,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So the solution to this is?</font>

1109
01:39:55,655 --> 01:39:57,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're working on it.</font>

1110
01:39:58,742 --> 01:39:59,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So,</font>

1111
01:40:00,410 --> 01:40:02,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">technically, this is a suicide mission.</font>

1112
01:40:13,924 --> 01:40:14,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1113
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:17,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a seat. Please.</font>

1114
01:40:21,848 --> 01:40:23,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In all the years
that I've known Ethan,</font>

1115
01:40:24,184 --> 01:40:26,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's only been serious
about two women.</font>

1116
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:29,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One was his wife.</font>

1117
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:31,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's married?</font>

1118
01:40:31,983 --> 01:40:33,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he was.</font>

1119
01:40:34,361 --> 01:40:36,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was? What happened to her?</font>

1120
01:40:36,446 --> 01:40:37,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, she was taken</font>

1121
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:40,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by some people
who wanted to get to Ethan.</font>

1122
01:40:41,034 --> 01:40:43,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay,
he got her back in one piece.</font>

1123
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:45,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then he quit the game.</font>

1124
01:40:46,915 --> 01:40:49,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were happy for a while.</font>

1125
01:40:49,543 --> 01:40:52,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But every time something bad
happened in the world,</font>

1126
01:40:52,671 --> 01:40:55,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan would think,
"l should've been there."</font>

1127
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:57,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she would wonder,
"Who's watching the world</font>

1128
01:40:58,009 --> 01:41:00,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"while Ethan's watching me?"</font>

1129
01:41:00,428 --> 01:41:03,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deep down, they both knew
that someday, somehow,</font>

1130
01:41:03,765 --> 01:41:06,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something truly terrible
was going to happen</font>

1131
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:10,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all because
they were together.</font>

1132
01:41:11,523 --> 01:41:12,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

1133
01:41:14,985 --> 01:41:17,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where is she now?
- She's a ghost.</font>

1134
01:41:17,946 --> 01:41:19,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good at it, too.</font>

1135
01:41:19,531 --> 01:41:21,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taught her myself.</font>

1136
01:41:21,533 --> 01:41:23,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every now and then,
she sends up a signal</font>

1137
01:41:23,994 --> 01:41:25,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to let Ethan know she's safe.</font>

1138
01:41:25,912 --> 01:41:27,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that keeps him going.</font>

1139
01:41:29,165 --> 01:41:30,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you telling me this?</font>

1140
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:38,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in this mess because
Ethan wouldn't let me die.</font>

1141
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:42,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a good man.</font>

1142
01:41:42,762 --> 01:41:46,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he cares about you
more than he can admit.</font>

1143
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:51,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's one more worry
than he can handle right now.</font>

1144
01:41:53,857 --> 01:41:55,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you care about him,</font>

1145
01:41:56,526 --> 01:41:58,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you should walk away.</font>

1146
01:42:01,531 --> 01:42:02,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luther...</font>

1147
01:42:02,991 --> 01:42:04,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ls everything all right?</font>

1148
01:42:16,755 --> 01:42:18,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming with you.</font>

1149
01:42:27,432 --> 01:42:28,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1150
01:42:32,687 --> 01:42:34,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So how do we find him?</font>

1151
01:42:35,774 --> 01:42:37,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Microwave transponder.</font>

1152
01:42:37,609 --> 01:42:40,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Traceable via satellite
anywhere in the world.</font>

1153
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:42,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lane had one of these
in the back of his neck.</font>

1154
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:44,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We removed it in Paris.</font>

1155
01:42:44,866 --> 01:42:47,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At the same time,
we put our own transponder in.</font>

1156
01:42:47,202 --> 01:42:48,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it.</font>

1157
01:42:50,246 --> 01:42:52,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">36-hour delayed activation,</font>

1158
01:42:52,666 --> 01:42:55,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in case Lane's Apostles scan him.</font>

1159
01:42:55,835 --> 01:42:57,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you planned on letting him go.</font>

1160
01:42:58,004 --> 01:43:00,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not this way, but yes.</font>

1161
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:01,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gonna lead us to the plutonium.</font>

1162
01:43:02,175 --> 01:43:03,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you be sure?</font>

1163
01:43:03,927 --> 01:43:06,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His plan to put me in prison went to hell.</font>

1164
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:09,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now he's gonna want me there
for the end.</font>

1165
01:43:09,849 --> 01:43:11,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So when does this transponder activate?</font>

1166
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:12,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got him. I got him,
I got him, I got him!</font>

1167
01:43:13,144 --> 01:43:15,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's traveling east
over Europe at 500 knots.</font>

1168
01:43:15,397 --> 01:43:16,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's airborne.</font>

1169
01:43:16,564 --> 01:43:17,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall we inform the CIA?</font>

1170
01:43:18,274 --> 01:43:19,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The CIA's been infiltrated.</font>

1171
01:43:19,901 --> 01:43:22,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't trust anybody
outside of this room.</font>

1172
01:43:22,779 --> 01:43:24,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna have to go it alone.</font>

1173
01:43:27,325 --> 01:43:28,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So where do we go?</font>

1174
01:43:48,722 --> 01:43:50,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How we doing, Benji?</font>

1175
01:43:50,515 --> 01:43:53,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If there's a way to defuse these bombs,
I can't find it.</font>

1176
01:43:53,351 --> 01:43:55,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll figure it out.
I know you will.</font>

1177
01:43:57,188 --> 01:43:59,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn. Ethan, we lost the signal.</font>

1178
01:43:59,899 --> 01:44:01,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lane must've found our transmitter.</font>

1179
01:44:01,901 --> 01:44:05,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's his last position?
- About 30 miles northeast.</font>

1180
01:44:05,488 --> 01:44:07,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then that's where he wants us to go.</font>

1181
01:44:07,657 --> 01:44:09,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's there?
- The Nubra River Valley.</font>

1182
01:44:09,659 --> 01:44:11,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only a medical camp there.</font>

1183
01:44:11,453 --> 01:44:13,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Humanitarian Aid Overseas.</font>

1184
01:44:14,164 --> 01:44:16,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would Lane target a medical camp?</font>

1185
01:44:17,542 --> 01:44:18,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smallpox.</font>

1186
01:44:19,210 --> 01:44:20,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1187
01:44:20,295 --> 01:44:23,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smallpox. The Apostles triggered
a smallpox outbreak in Kashmir.</font>

1188
01:44:24,048 --> 01:44:26,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lane must've wanted that camp there
for a reason.</font>

1189
01:44:26,926 --> 01:44:28,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what?</font>

1190
01:44:28,803 --> 01:44:30,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God.
- What is it?</font>

1191
01:44:31,723 --> 01:44:34,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Nubra River is at the base
of the Siachen Glacier.</font>

1192
01:44:35,143 --> 01:44:36,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So a nuclear blast there
would irradiate</font>

1193
01:44:36,728 --> 01:44:39,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the largest natural irrigation system
in the world.</font>

1194
01:44:40,482 --> 01:44:44,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fresh water from the border of
China to India and Pakistan.</font>

1195
01:44:45,779 --> 01:44:48,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're gonna starve one-third
of the world's population.</font>

1196
01:44:48,448 --> 01:44:49,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The greater the suffering..."</font>

1197
01:44:49,908 --> 01:44:51,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"...the greater the peace."</font>

1198
01:44:52,452 --> 01:44:55,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still don't understand
why Lane wants a medical camp there.</font>

1199
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:56,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't matter.</font>

1200
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:59,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All that matters now is we find a way
to defuse those bombs.</font>

1201
01:44:59,459 --> 01:45:01,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I've found it.</font>

1202
01:45:01,544 --> 01:45:03,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>

1203
01:45:03,129 --> 01:45:05,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, there appears to be a flaw
in the bomb's operating system.</font>

1204
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:07,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The remote detonator
requires that firing key.</font>

1205
01:45:08,134 --> 01:45:10,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we remove that key,
then it should short out</font>

1206
01:45:10,553 --> 01:45:12,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the fail-safe and allow us
to cut both fuses.</font>

1207
01:45:13,139 --> 01:45:14,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So one of us needs to get the detonator</font>

1208
01:45:14,682 --> 01:45:15,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and remove that key.</font>

1209
01:45:15,767 --> 01:45:16,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1210
01:45:16,976 --> 01:45:19,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While the rest of us cut the fuses
on both bombs. Simple.</font>

1211
01:45:20,563 --> 01:45:21,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but...</font>

1212
01:45:22,232 --> 01:45:23,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what?</font>

1213
01:45:23,858 --> 01:45:26,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, in order to make this work,</font>

1214
01:45:26,110 --> 01:45:28,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can't remove the key
or cut the fuses</font>

1215
01:45:28,404 --> 01:45:31,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until after the countdown starts.</font>

1216
01:45:31,658 --> 01:45:33,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But wait, just so I've got this clear.</font>

1217
01:45:33,576 --> 01:45:36,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our only chance
to safely defuse both bombs</font>

1218
01:45:36,162 --> 01:45:38,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is to let the countdown start.</font>

1219
01:45:38,998 --> 01:45:41,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then remove that key.</font>

1220
01:45:49,592 --> 01:45:50,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1221
01:46:08,987 --> 01:46:12,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Both devices are now
connected to the detonator.</font>

1222
01:46:13,408 --> 01:46:15,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">15 minutes should
give you enough time</font>

1223
01:46:15,451 --> 01:46:17,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to reach minimum safe distance.</font>

1224
01:46:19,956 --> 01:46:22,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My running days are over.</font>

1225
01:46:23,042 --> 01:46:25,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is where it ends for me.</font>

1226
01:46:53,948 --> 01:46:56,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm getting signals all over the place.</font>

1227
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:59,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're at a medical camp.
X-ray machines, CAT scanners,</font>

1228
01:46:59,662 --> 01:47:01,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">radiological signatures everywhere.</font>

1229
01:47:01,205 --> 01:47:02,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a needle in a haystack.</font>

1230
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:04,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Process of elimination, one at a time.</font>

1231
01:47:04,834 --> 01:47:06,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's split up. Stay on comms.</font>

1235
01:47:35,365 --> 01:47:36,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Julia!</font>

1236
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does he know?</font>

1237
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:41,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1238
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:44,666

1243
01:47:52,423 --> 01:47:53,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you're kidding.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What a coincidence!
- I know. I...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What brings you all this way?
- I was...</font>

1246
01:47:57,845 --> 01:47:59,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l was in Turtuk, not far from here</font>

1247
01:48:00,014 --> 01:48:02,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and heard help was needed.</font>

1248
01:48:02,767 --> 01:48:03,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Well,</font>

1249
01:48:03,935 --> 01:48:05,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">actually we're just about finished here.</font>

1250
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:08,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole village is inoculated. But...</font>

1251
01:48:09,023 --> 01:48:10,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were you doing out in Turtuk?</font>

1252
01:48:11,442 --> 01:48:12,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rob's on vacation.</font>

1253
01:48:13,111 --> 01:48:15,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, I'm... I'm working.</font>

1254
01:48:18,157 --> 01:48:19,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a long way from home.</font>

1255
01:48:20,076 --> 01:48:22,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah.
Thanks to our guardian angel.</font>

1256
01:48:22,996 --> 01:48:23,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guardian?</font>

1257
01:48:24,247 --> 01:48:25,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, yeah. We were
running a field hospital</font>

1258
01:48:25,915 --> 01:48:28,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">outside of Darfur when
the outbreak happened here.</font>

1259
01:48:28,167 --> 01:48:29,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And here comes this phone call</font>

1260
01:48:29,293 --> 01:48:30,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from an anonymous donor,
out of the blue.</font>

1261
01:48:31,754 --> 01:48:33,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he says he's ready to underwrite</font>

1262
01:48:33,256 --> 01:48:35,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the entire operation. One condition.</font>

1263
01:48:36,217 --> 01:48:37,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We run the whole thing.</font>

1264
01:48:37,927 --> 01:48:39,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you believe that?</font>

1265
01:48:40,930 --> 01:48:42,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I certainly can.</font>

1266
01:48:42,849 --> 01:48:44,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Out of the blue.</font>

1267
01:48:44,517 --> 01:48:45,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out of the blue.</font>

1268
01:48:48,438 --> 01:48:49,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's quite a full life.</font>

1269
01:48:50,106 --> 01:48:52,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you know, before Julia,
I never traveled.</font>

1270
01:48:52,358 --> 01:48:54,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I never even left New York.</i></font>

1271
01:48:54,193 --> 01:48:55,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Never left the hospital.</i></font>

1272
01:48:55,903 --> 01:48:58,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>7 days a week,
dusk till dawn. No vacations.</i></font>

1273
01:48:58,614 --> 01:49:00,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan, I think I found something.</font>

1274
01:49:00,199 --> 01:49:02,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was on the fast track to be
Chief of Surgery at 50.</font>

1275
01:49:02,243 --> 01:49:03,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heart attack at 55.</font>

1276
01:49:03,703 --> 01:49:06,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she convinced me
to let it all go.</font>

1277
01:49:07,290 --> 01:49:08,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help where it's needed most.</font>

1278
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:11,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we've been on the go ever since,</font>

1279
01:49:11,461 --> 01:49:13,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I've never been more fulfilled.</font>

1280
01:49:14,464 --> 01:49:16,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm happy for you.</font>

1281
01:49:17,216 --> 01:49:18,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Thank you.</i></font>

1282
01:49:20,386 --> 01:49:22,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we should get going.</font>

1283
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:23,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a lot of
packing to do.</font>

1284
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:25,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, I'll handle that.
You two should catch up.</font>

1285
01:49:25,808 --> 01:49:27,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, I should
get out of your hair.</font>

1286
01:49:27,643 --> 01:49:29,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding?
You should stick around.</font>

1287
01:49:29,812 --> 01:49:32,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just sorry you came
all this way for nothing.</font>

1288
01:49:34,275 --> 01:49:36,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell you what, we'll pack,</font>

1289
01:49:36,903 --> 01:49:38,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and why don't we give you
a ride back to Turtuk,</font>

1290
01:49:38,905 --> 01:49:41,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you two can catch up
in the car? Yeah?</font>

1291
01:49:41,866 --> 01:49:43,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're very kind.</font>

1292
01:49:44,285 --> 01:49:46,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Settled. See you soon.</font>

1293
01:49:48,164 --> 01:49:49,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was good to see you.</font>

1294
01:49:50,958 --> 01:49:53,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so sorry, Julia. I'm so sorry.</font>

1295
01:50:15,066 --> 01:50:16,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take both helicopters.</font>

1296
01:50:18,152 --> 01:50:19,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one else leaves.</font>

1297
01:50:27,912 --> 01:50:29,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful, careful, careful.</font>

1298
01:50:34,335 --> 01:50:35,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's armed.</font>

1299
01:50:35,419 --> 01:50:36,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the countdown hasn't started yet.</font>

1300
01:50:36,963 --> 01:50:38,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The network signal's strong,
which means the other device</font>

1301
01:50:38,756 --> 01:50:40,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is close by and the detonator.</font>

1302
01:50:40,466 --> 01:50:42,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About half a K in that direction.</font>

1303
01:50:44,011 --> 01:50:45,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're still here.</font>

1304
01:50:46,889 --> 01:50:48,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luther, you keep working on it.</font>

1305
01:50:48,182 --> 01:50:49,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two, come with me.</font>

1306
01:50:50,935 --> 01:50:53,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, sure. I got this.</font>

1307
01:50:53,688 --> 01:50:55,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry about old Luther.</font>

1308
01:51:29,724 --> 01:51:31,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walker.</font>

1309
01:51:36,731 --> 01:51:37,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn.</font>

1310
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:39,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan, the countdown has started!</font>

1311
01:51:39,358 --> 01:51:40,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We have 15 minutes.</i></font>

1312
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:42,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walker has the detonator.</font>

1313
01:51:52,038 --> 01:51:53,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on!</font>

1314
01:51:55,374 --> 01:51:56,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to evacuate these people.</font>

1315
01:51:56,876 --> 01:51:57,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no time.</font>

1316
01:51:58,044 --> 01:52:00,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This whole valley's gonna be
incinerated in 15 minutes.</font>

1317
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:05,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too late!</font>

1318
01:52:05,676 --> 01:52:06,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1319
01:52:07,011 --> 01:52:08,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna get the detonator.</font>

1320
01:52:08,679 --> 01:52:10,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What? How?
- l'll figure it out.</font>

1321
01:52:11,557 --> 01:52:13,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find Lane!
Find the other bomb!</font>

1322
01:52:14,810 --> 01:52:17,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the hell is he doing?
- I find it best not to look.</font>

1323
01:52:52,723 --> 01:52:53,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How we doing, Luther?</font>

1324
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:55,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tripwires everywhere.
I don't have enough hands.</font>

1325
01:52:55,893 --> 01:52:57,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Just make it happen.</i></font>

1326
01:52:57,186 --> 01:52:58,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Where's Ethan?</i></font>

1327
01:52:58,312 --> 01:52:59,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gone after the detonator.</font>

1328
01:53:00,022 --> 01:53:01,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wait, where's the detonator?</i></font>

1329
01:53:39,312 --> 01:53:40,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luther.</font>

1330
01:53:41,230 --> 01:53:43,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Julia. You shouldn't be here.</font>

1331

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1332
01:53:45,192 --> 01:53:46,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1333
01:53:46,861 --> 01:53:47,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what I think it is?</font>

1336
01:53:53,284 --> 01:53:54,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can I do?</font>

1337
01:53:56,787 --> 01:53:58,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the kit,
the pliers with the red grip.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you insane?

Why not one?</font>

We'll do it on one.</font>
