<font color="#ffff00">MASTER</font>: I warned you.

3
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,170
Did I not warn you what would
come of dealing with dwarves?

4
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,670
Now they've done it.

5
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,070
They've woken the dragon.

6
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,180
They've brought an apocalypse
upon our heads.

7
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,510
Come on! Quickly! Quickly!

8
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,680
Faster now, I'm trying
to evacuate myself here.

9
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,180
Careful, man.

10
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,380
Never mind the books.

11
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,090
Get on. Get the rest of it!

12
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,820
<font color="#ffff00">ALFRID</font>: But, sire, should we not
try to save the town?

13
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,760
The town is lost. Save the gold!

14
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,260
<font color="#ffff00">BRAGA</font>: You heard him.
Get a move on.

15
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,160
<font color="#ffff00">GIRL</font>: Da! Come on, we must go.

16
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,900
<font color="#ffff00">MAN ♪2</font>: Pile 'em up!

17
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,710
We have no time. We must leave.

00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,050
<font color="#ffff00">BOFUR</font>: Get him up.

19
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,380
- Come on, brother.
- Come on, come on. Let's go.

20
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,850
I'm fine. I can walk.

21
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,920
Fast as you can.
We're not leaving.

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,290
Not without our father.

23
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,950
If you stay here,
your sisters will die.

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,420
Is that what your father
would want?

25
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,190
Open this door!

26
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,760
Do you hear me?!

27
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,040

We gotta go.

30
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,480

If only we could take more of
these poor people with us.

39
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,610
But they're hardly...

40
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,680
Worth it. I quite agree.

41
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,250
<font color="#ffff00">BOFUR</font>: Look out!

42

My gold! My gold!

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,660
We're carrying too much weight.

46
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,400
We need to dump something.

47
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,200
Quite right, Alfrid.

48
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,070
Huh? Huh?

49
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,680
Ah, ah, ah, aah!

50
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,210
Faster! Faster!

51
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,660
Poor souls.

52
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,560
Da.

53
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,990
Da!

54
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,900
- He hit it! He hit the dragon!
- No.

55
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,770
He did! He hit his mark! I saw!

56
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,170
His arrows
cannot Pierce its hide.

57
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,840
I fear nothing will.

58
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,890

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,290

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,200
We cannot go back.

Bain!

63
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,090
Dad!

64
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,120
Bain! What are you doing?!
Why didn't you leave?!

65
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,460
You were supposed to leave!

66
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,560
I came to help you.

67
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,930
- No!
- Nothing can stop it now.

68
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,500
<i>This</i> might.

69
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,570
Bain. You go back.

70
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,910
You get out of here. Now.

71
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,010

Aah!

74
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,060
Stop, stop! Halt! Halt!

75
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,910
Who are you that would stand
against me?

76
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,450
Now that<i> is</i> a pity.

77
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,290
What will you do now...

78
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,960
Bowman?

79
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,530
You are forsaken.

80
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,130
No help will come.

81
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,870
<font color="#ffff00">Master</font>: Now's our chance!

Go! Go!

Head for the open water!

84
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,170
Hmm. Ah.

85
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,380
Is that<i> your</i> child?

86
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,980
You cannot save him
from the fire.

87
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,390
He will<i> burn.</i>

88
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,170
Stay still, son. Stay still.

89
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,350
Tell me,<i> wretch,</i>

00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,030
But your death!

93
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,570
Bain. Look at me.

94
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,270
You look at me.

95
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,610
Little to your left.

96
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,680
That's it.

97
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,380
Ah!

98
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,360
Bain! Hold on!

99
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,440
What was that?

100
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,840
What happened?

101
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,210
It fell. I saw it.

102
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,180
It's dead.

103
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
Smaug is dead.

104
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,890

106
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,960
The ravens of Erebor

107
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,870
are returning to the mountain.

108
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,570
Aye. Word will spread.

109
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,970
Before long every soul
in middle-earth

110

will know the dragon is dead!

We're leaving.

123

They are your people.
You must go.

Come with me.

125
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,920
I know how I feel.
I'm not afraid.

126
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,590
You make me feel alive.

127
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,450
Oh, I can't.

130
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,100
I don't know what that means.

131
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,330
I think you do.

<font color="#ffff00">DWARF</font>: One more!

Keep it.

134
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,250
As a promise.

135
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,210
These are dry. You'll need them.

136
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,680
- Thank you.
- Here.

137
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,850
Oi! Give me one of them.

138
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,180
I'll catch my death
in this cold.

139
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,850
Oh, find your own!

140
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,020
You're not in charge now,
Alfrid Lickspittle.

141
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,360
That is where you are wrong.

142
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
In the absence of the master,

143
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,560
the power cedes to his deputy,

144
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,930
which in this instance
is my good self.

145
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,860
Now give me that blanket!

146
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,930
Master's deputy?

147
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,570
Don't make me laugh.

148
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,570
You're a sneak-thief, more like.

149
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,040
I'll be dead before I answer
to the likes of you.

150
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,440
Maybe that can be arranged.

151
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,650
I wouldn't go turning
on your own, Alfrid.

152
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,050
Not now.

153
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,120
Ugh!

154
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,120
Da!

155
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:39,890
Come here!

156
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,630
You're alive!

157
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,500
It's all right, darling.

158
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,430
<font color="#ffff00">PERCY</font>: It was bard!

159
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,000
He killed the dragon!
I saw it with me own eyes.

160
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,570
He brought the beast down!

161
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,110
Shot him dead
with a black arrow.

162
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,480
Thank you, bard!

163
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,250
<font color="#ffff00">WOMAN</font>: Thank you!

164
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,480
You've saved us all! Bless you.

165
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,260
All hail to the dragon slayer!

166
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,160
All hail king bard!

167
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,360
I have said it many times.

168
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,270
This is a man of noble stock.

169
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,470
A born leader!

170
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,840
<font color="#ffff00">Bard</font>: Do not call me that.

171
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,110
I'm not the master of this town.

172
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,280
Where is he?!

173
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,540
Where's the master?!

174
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,450
<font color="#ffff00">Woman</font>: Halfway down the anduin.

175
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,450
With all our coin,
I don't doubt.

176
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,720
You would know.

177
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,180
You helped him empty
the treasury.

178
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,490
No.

179
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,790
I tried to stop him.

180
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,520
- Liar!
- Cheat!

181
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,120
You're a mongrel!

182
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,660
I begged. I pleaded.

183
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,060
- Let's do away with him!
- Tar him!

184
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,500
I said, "master, no!"

185
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,970
"Think of the children."

186
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,400
Hang him!

187
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,640
"Will nobody think
of the children?!?"

188
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,410
Aah!

189
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,210
To the tree with him!

190
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,320
Aah!

191
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,350
- Hang him high!
- Take him down!

192
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,390
Enough!

193
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,260
Let him go! Let him go!

194
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,400
Look around you!

195
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,370
Have you not had your fill
of death?!

196
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,940
Winter is upon us.

197
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,340
We must look to our own.

198
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,110
To the sick and the helpless.

199
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,550
Those who can stand,
tend to the wounded.

200
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,350
And those who have strength
left, follow me.

201
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,020
We must salvage what we can.

202
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,580
And what then?
What'll we do then?

203
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,020
We find shelter.

204
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,240
<font color="#ffff00">Bofur</font>: Hello!

205
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,510
Bombur?

206
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,140
Bifur?

207
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,580
Anybody?

208
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,090
<font color="#ffff00">BILBO</font>: Wait!

209
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,290
Wait!

210
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,160
- It's Bilbo!
- He's alive!

211
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,130
Stop! Stop! Stop.

212
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,460
You need to leave.
We all need to leave.

213
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,100
We only just got here.

214
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,330
I've tried talking to him,
but he won't listen.

215
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,100
What do you mean, laddie?
Thorin!

216
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,840
- Thorin. Thorin.
- He's been down there for days.

217
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,310
He doesn't sleep.
He barely eats.

218
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,610
He's not been himself.
Not at all.

219
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,380
It's this... it's this place.

220
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,550
I think a sickness lies on it.

221
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,050
<font color="#ffff00">KILI</font>: Sickness?

222
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,190
What kind of sickness?

223
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,560
Fili. Fili!

224
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,220
Fili!

225
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,820
<font color="#ffff00">THORIN</font>: Gold.

226
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,090
Gold beyond measure.

227
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,230
Beyond sorrow...

228
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,170
And grief.

229
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,710
Behold the great...

230
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,110
Treasure hoard of thror.

231
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,330
Welcome my sister-sons...

232
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,530
to the kingdom...

233
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,530
Of Erebor.

234
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,570
Balin!

235
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,440
Kili!

236
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,950
Balin:
Thank Durin, you're alive!

237
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,550
Bombur!

238
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,720
<font color="#ffff00">ORI</font>: You're alive!

239
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,390
<font color="#ffff00">Thorin</font>: Any sign of it?

240
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,490
<font color="#ffff00">DWALIN</font>: Nothing yet.

241
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:11,790
<font color="#ffff00">ORI</font>: Nothing here.

242
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,060
Keep searching!

243
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,220
<font color="#ffff00">OIN</font>: That Jewel
could be anywhere.

244
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,630
The Arkenstone
is in these halls.

245
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,830
Find it!

246
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,400
<font color="#ffff00">DWALIN</font>: You heard him.
Keep looking.

247
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,230
All of you!

248
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,000
No one rests until it is found.

249
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:59,000
<i>I am almost tempted
to let you take it.</i>

250
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,310
<i>If only to see
Oakenshield suffer.</i>

251
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:08,110
<i>Watch it destroy him.</i>

252
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:12,380
<i>Watch it corrupt his heart</i>

253
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,020
<i>and drive him</i> mad.

254
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,680
<font color="#ffff00">MAN</font>: I've got you.

255
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,490
<font color="#ffff00">Bard</font>: Take only what you need.

256
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,390
We have a long march ahead.

257
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,490
Where will you go?

258
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,060
There is only one place.

259
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,870
<font color="#ffff00">ALFRID</font>: The mountain.

260
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,600
You are a genius, sire.

261
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,670
We can take refuge
inside the mountain.

262
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,040
It might smell a bit of dragon,

263
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,680
but the women can clean that up.

264
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,240
It'll be safe and warm and dry

265
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,280
and full of stores,
bedding, clothing,

266
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,850
the odd bit o' gold.

267
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:24,350
What gold is in that mountain
is cursed.

268
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,860
- We will take only.
- What was promised to us.

269
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,890
Only what we need
to rebuild our lives.

270
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,530
Here. Pull your weight.

271
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,870
News of the death of Smaug

272
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,070
will have spread
through the lands.

273
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,040
Aye.

274
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,480
Others will now look
to the mountain...

275
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,410
For its wealth,

276
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,880
for its position.

277
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,710
What is it you know?

278
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,720
Nothing for certain.

279
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,920
It's what I fear may come.

280
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,620
You saw something out there.

281
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:11,190
The orc I pursued out of
lake-town, I know who he is.

282
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,460
Bolg, spawn of Azog the defiler.

283
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,300
A warg pack was waiting for him

284
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,000
on the outskirts of esgaroth.

285
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,300
They fled into the north.

286
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,470
These orcs were different
from the others.

287
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,540
They bore a mark I have not seen
for a long time.

288
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,380
The mark of gundabad.

289
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,480
Gundabad?

290
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,980
An orc stronghold
in the far north

291
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,310
of the misty mountains.

292
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,500
You may tell my father

293
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,670
if there is no place
for Tauriel,

294
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,740
there is no place for me.

295
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,940
Legolas...

296
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,140
It is your king's command.

297
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,920
I ride north.
Will you come with me?

298
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,750
To where?

299
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,090
To gundabad.

300
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,280
I come for mithrandir.

301
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,820
And I will leave with him.

302
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,560
If you try to stop me,
I will destroy you.

303
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,930
Nine for mortal men
doomed to die.

304
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,470
I am not alone.

305
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,780
Are you in need of assistance,
my lady?

306
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,760
You should've stayed dead.

307
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,430
Ah!

308
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,550
Mithrandir...

309
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,190
Come back.

310
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,690
He is here.

311
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,350
Yes.

312
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,590
The darkness has returned.

313
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,570
Come on! Oh! Whoa!

314
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,400
<font color="#ffff00">RADAGAST</font>: Gandalf!

315
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,870
Gandalf! Climb on!

316
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,450
He is weak.
He cannot remain here.

317
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,410
It is draining his life.

318
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,420
Go! Quickly!

319
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,760
Come with me, my lady.

320
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,600
Go!

321
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:13,610
You have no power here...

322
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:16,650
Servant of morgoth.

323
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,850
You are nameless!

324
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:26,960
Faceless.

325
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,460
Formless.

326
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:36,970
Go back to the void

327
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:42,810
from whence you came!

328
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,160
The spirit of Sauron endured.

329
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,160
And has been banished.

330
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,570
He will flee into the east.

331
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,670
Gondor should be warned.

332
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,440
They must set a watch
on the walls of mordor.

333
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,280
<font color="#ffff00">SARUMAN</font>: No.

334
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,180
Look after the lady Galadriel.

335
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,550
She has spent much of her power.

336
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,350
Her strength is failing.

337
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,020
Take her to lothlórien.

338
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,520
My lord saruman.

339
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,420
He must be hunted down

340
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,620
and destroyed once and for all.

341
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,520
Without the ring of power.

342
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,560
Sauron can never again hold
dominion over middle-earth.

343
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,100
Go now.

344
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,700
Leave Sauron to me.

345
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,310
- I need that horse.
- What?

346
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,610
Gandalf, where are you going?

347
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,380
To warn Erebor.

348
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,550
They have no idea
what is coming.

349
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,450
I saw them with my own eyes.

350
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,120
Rank upon rank of Moria orcs!

351
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,230
You must summon our friends,
bird and beast.

352
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,730
The battle for the mountain
is about to begin.

353
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,160
Wait.

354
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,730
Take this.

355
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,610
If what you say is true,

356
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,740
then you'll need it more than I.

357
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,650
Thank you.

358
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,950
A word of warning...

359
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:35,420
It... Can be a bit dicky
sometimes.

360
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,790
You just have to twiddle
with the top.

361
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:42,190
I expect you'll manage.

362
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,530
Thorin:
It is here in these halls.

363
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,770
I know it.

364
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:53,040
<font color="#ffff00">DWALIN</font>: We have searched
and searched.

365
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,600
Not well enough.

366
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,610
Thorin, we all would see
the stone returned.

367
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:01,780
And yet, it is still not found!

368
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:07,220
Do you doubt the loyalty
of anyone here?

369
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:20,330
The Arkenstone is the birthright
of our people.

370
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,800
It is the king's Jewel.

371
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,940
Am I not the king?!

372
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,720
Know this.

373
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,220
If anyone should find it

374
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,390
and withhold it from me...

375
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,060
I will be avenged.

376
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,150
Dragon-sickness.

377
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,250
I've seen it before.

378
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,690
That look.

379
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,850
That terrible need.

380
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,260
It is a fierce
and jealous love, Bilbo.

381
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,760
It sent his grandfather mad.

382
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,470
Balin, if... If Thorin...

383
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,700
Had the Arkenstone...

384
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:38,110
Or if it... If it was found...

385
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:41,880
Would it help?

386
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,720
That stone crowns all.

387
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,920
It is the summit
of this great wealth...

388
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,490
Bestowing power
upon he who bears it.

389
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,660
Would it stay his madness?

390
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,800
No, laddie.

391
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,730
I fear it would make him worse.

392
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,500
Perhaps it is best...

393
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:11,170
It remains lost.

394
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,090
What is that?

395
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,860
In your hand!

396
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,990
It's... it's nothing.

397
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,690
Show me.

398
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,110
I picked it up
in Beorn's Garden.

399
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,950
You've carried it all this way?

400
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,150
I'm gonna plant it in my garden.

401
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,450
In bag end.

402
00:39:55,950 --> 00:40:00,560
It's a poor prize to take back
to the shire.

403
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,730
One day, it'll grow.

404
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,300
And every time I look at it,
I'll remember.

405
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,870
Remember everything
that happened.

406
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,200
The good, the bad...

407
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,370
And how lucky I am
that I made it home.

408
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,750
Thorin, I...

409
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,580
<font color="#ffff00">DWALIN</font>: Thorin.

410
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,850
The survivors from lake-town...

411
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:32,520
They're streaming in to Dale.

412
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,490
There's hundreds of them.

413
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:38,990
Call everyone to the gate.

414
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,930
To the gate! Now!

415
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,700
<font color="#ffff00">BARD</font>: Come on. Keep moving.

416
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,600
<font color="#ffff00">ALFRID</font>: Sire!

417
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,530
Sire!

418
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,370
Up here!

419
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,380
Look, sire!
The braziers are lit.

420
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,220
So...

421
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,420
- The company of.
- Thorin Oakenshield survived.

422
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,720
Survived?

423
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,090
You mean there's a bunch of dwarves
in there with all that gold?

424
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,890
I shouldn't worry, Alfrid.

425
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,660
There's gold enough
in that mountain for all.

426
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,930
Make camp here tonight!

427
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,900
Find what shelter you can.

428
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,800
Get some fires going.

429
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,140
Percy:
Come on, hurry along, now.

430
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,410
- Alfrid.
- You take the night watch.

431
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,150
<font color="#ffff00">BOFUR</font>: Up it goes!

432
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,090
<font color="#ffff00">DWALIN</font>: That's it.

433
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,530
<font color="#ffff00">THORIN</font>: I want this fortress
made safe by sunup.

434
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,860
This mountain was hard-won.

435
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,000
I will not see it taken again.

436
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,300
The people of lake-town
have nothing.

437
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:29,610
They came to us in need.
They have lost everything.

438
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:33,040
Do not tell<i> me</i>
what<i> they</i> have lost.

439
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,610
I know well enough
their hardship.

440
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:42,050
Those who have lived through
dragon fire should rejoice.

441
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:46,120
They have much
to be grateful for.

442
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,030
More stone!

443
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,030
Bring more stone to the gate!

444
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,560
Man:
These children are starving.

445
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,060
We need food.

446
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,330
<font color="#ffff00">Percy</font>: We won't last three days.

447
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,560
Bard, we don't have enough.

448
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,430
Do what you can, Percy.

449
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,060
<font color="#ffff00">MAN</font>: It'll be all right.
Don't worry.

450
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,570
<font color="#ffff00">Woman</font>: We need more water.

451
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:34,340
The children, the wounded
and the women come first.

452
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,910
Here you are.

453
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,510
Good morning, Alfrid.

454
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,910
What news from the night watch?

455
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,680
All quiet, sire.
Not much to report.

456
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,450
Nothing gets past me.

457
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:55,560
Except an army of elves,
it would seem.

458
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,330
My lord thranduil.

459
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,840
We did not look to see you here.

460
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,670
I heard you needed aid.

461
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:04,360
Here you go!

462
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,330
Another one!

463
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,500
<font color="#ffff00">Bard</font>: You have saved us.

464
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,870
I do not know how to thank you.

465
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,940
Your gratitude is misplaced.

466
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,610
I did not come on your behalf.

467
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:21,610
I came to reclaim
something of mine.

468
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:32,220
There are gems in the mountain
that I, too, desire.

469
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,060
White gems of pure starlight.

470
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:39,330
The white gems of lasgalen.

471
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:43,570
I know an elf lord who will pay
a pretty price for these.

472
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:52,370
Wait! Please wait!

473
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,150
You would go to war
over a handful of gems?

474
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:00,820
The heirlooms of my people
are not lightly forsaken.

475
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,380
We are allies in this.

476
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,990
My people also have a claim

477
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,990
upon the riches
in that mountain.

478
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:10,030
Let me speak with Thorin.

479
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:13,600
You would try to reason
with the dwarf?

480
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,660
To avoid war?

481
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,000
Yes.

482
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,170
<font color="#ffff00">Gloin</font>: Not a bad night's work.

483
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,770
Come on.

484
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:47,430
Hail, Thorin, son of thrain.

485
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:51,100
We are glad to find you alive
beyond hope.

486
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,630
Why do you come to the gates

487
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,440
of the king under the mountain
armed for war?

488
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,740
Why does the king under
the mountain fence himself in

489
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,580
like a robber in his hold?

490
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,750
Perhaps it is because I am
expecting to be robbed.

491
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,450
My lord...

492
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,220
We have not come to rob you,

493
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,920
but to seek fair settlement.

494
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,560
Will you not speak with me?

495
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,660
I am listening.

496
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,430
On behalf of the people
of lake-town,

497
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,030
I ask that you honor
your pledge.

498
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,770
A share of the treasure

499
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:01,170
so that they might rebuild
their lives.

500
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,470
I will not treat with any man

501
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,340
while an armed host
lies before my door.

502
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,610
- That armed host.
- Will attack this mountain

503
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,280
if we do not come to terms.

504
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,320
And your threats do not sway me.

505
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,550
What of your conscience?

506
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,120
Does it not tell you
our cause is just?

507
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:26,030
My people offered you help.

508
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,900
And in return,

509
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,500
you brought upon them
only ruin and death.

510
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,470
When did the men of lake-town
come to our aid

511
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,070
but for the promise
of rich reward?

512
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:36,710
A bargain was struck!

513
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:37,970
A bargain?

514
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,340
What choice did we have

515
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,480
but to barter our birthright
for blankets and food,

516
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,480
to ransom our future in exchange
for our freedom?

517
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,550
You call that a fair trade?

518
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:55,320
Tell me, bard
the dragon slayer...

519
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,560
Why should I honor such terms?

520
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:03,800
Because you gave us your word.

521
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,970
Does that mean nothing?

522
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,520
Begone!

523
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,060
Ere our arrows fly!

524
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,440
<font color="#ffff00">Bilbo</font>: What are you doing?

525
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,250
You cannot go to war.

526
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,750
This does not concern you.

527
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:55,880
Excuse me, but just in case
you haven't noticed,

528
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:58,390
there is an army of elves
out there.

529
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:02,120
Not to mention several hundred
angry fishermen.

530
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:03,960
W-we are, in fact, outnumbered.

531
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,830
Not for much longer.

532
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,430
What does that mean?

533
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:13,000
It means, master Baggins...

534
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,970
you should never
underestimate dwarves.

535
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,350
We have reclaimed Erebor.

536
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:27,480
Now we defend it.

537
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,370
He will give us nothing.

538
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:49,500
Such a pity.

539
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,840
Still, you tried.

540
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,780
I do not understand.

541
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:56,010
Why?

542
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:58,210
Why would he risk war?

543
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,230
It is fruitless to reason
with them.

544
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:16,530
They understand only one thing.

545
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,040
We attack at dawn.

546
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,070
Are you with us?

547
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:59,110
Aye.

548
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:06,420
Thorin:
Master Baggins, come here.

549
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:25,370
You're going to need this.

550
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:27,700
Put it on.

551
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:35,440
This vest is made
of silver steel.

552
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:41,680
"Mithril" it was called
by my forebears.

553
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:46,620
No blade can Pierce it.

554
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,330
I look absurd.

555
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:01,170
I'm not a warrior, I'm a hobbit.

556
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,410
It is a gift.

557
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:06,140
A token of our friendship.

558
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:12,750
True friends
are hard to come by.

559
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:17,590
I have been blind
but now I begin to see.

560
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:20,190
I am betrayed.

561
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:23,190
Betrayed?

562
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:25,930
The Arkenstone.

563
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:36,510
One of them has taken it.

564
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:46,980
One of them is false.

565
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:51,190
Thorin, the quest<i> is</i> fulfilled.

566
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:52,520
You've won the mountain.

567
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,490
Is that not enough?

568
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:56,690
Betrayed by my own kin.

569
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,160
Now, uh, you...

570
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,960
You made a promise to the people
of lake-town.

571
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,170
Now, I-is this treasure truly
worth more than your honor?

572
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,500
<i>Our</i> honor, Thorin.
I was also there.

573
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,700
I gave my word.

574
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,470
For that, I am grateful.

575
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:11,810
It was nobly done.

576
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:13,210
But the treasure
in this mountain

577
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:16,140
does not belong to the people
of lake-town.

578
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,280
This gold...

579
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,690
is ours.

580
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,720
And ours alone.

581
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,660
By my life...

582
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,930
I will not part

583
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:40,340
with a s-s-s-s-single coin.

584
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,670
Not...

585
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:49,440
One piece of it.

586
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,100
<font color="#ffff00">TAURIEL</font>: Gundabad.

587
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:15,640
What lies beyond?

588
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:20,940
- An old enemy.
- The ancient kingdom of angmar.

589
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,080
This fortress was once
its stronghold.

590
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,720
It is where they kept
their great armories.

591
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,790
Forged their weapons of war.

592
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:34,790
A light. I saw movement.

593
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:39,590
We wait for the cover of night.

594
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,460
It is a fell place, Tauriel.

595
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:43,900
In another age,

596
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,970
our people waged war
on those lands.

597
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:59,010
My mother died there.

598
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,850
My father does not speak of it.

599
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:06,690
There is no grave.

600
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:09,090
No memory.

601
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:13,160
Nothing.

602
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:20,870
Ugh!

603
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:23,640
Let me through!

604
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,940
Make way!

605
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:42,960
<font color="#ffff00">ALFRID</font>: No, no, no! Oi!

606
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,160
You!

607
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,690
Pointy hat!

608
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,060
Yes.

609
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,500
You.

610
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,070
We don't want no tramps,
beggars,

611
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,500
nor vagabonds 'round here.

612
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,170
We got enough trouble
without the likes of you.

613
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:59,210
Off you go. On your horse.

614
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:01,140
Who's in charge here?

615
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,380
Who is asking?

616
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:09,680
You must set aside your petty
grievances with the dwarves.

617
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,020
War is coming!

618
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:14,020
The cesspits of Dol Guldur
have been emptied.

619
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:17,490
You're all in mortal danger.

620
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:18,930
What are you talking about?

621
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:22,830
I can see you know nothing
of wizards.

622
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:25,530
They are like winter thunder
on a wild wind

623
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:29,240
rolling in from a distance,
breaking hard in alarm.

624
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:34,740
But sometimes a storm
is just a storm.

625
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,540
Not this time.

626
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:39,110
Armies of orcs are on the move.

627
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,780
- These are fighters.
- They have been bred for war.

628
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,690
Our enemy has summoned
his full strength.

629
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:46,520
Why show his hand now?

630
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,920
Because we forced him.

631
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,290
We forced him when the company
of Thorin Oakenshield

632
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:52,960
set out to reclaim
their homeland.

633
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,600
The dwarves were never meant
to reach Erebor.

634
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,430
Azog the defiler was sent
to kill them.

635
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,940
His master seeks control
of the mountain.

636
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:06,440
Not just for the treasure within
but for where it lies,

637
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,140
its strategic position.

638
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:12,550
This is the gateway to
reclaiming the lands of angmar

639
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:13,720
in the north.

640
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,050
If that fell kingdom
should rise again...

641
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:20,620
Rivendell, lórien, the shire...

642
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:23,730
Even gondor itself will fall.

643
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:26,960
These orc armies
you speak of, mithrandir,

644
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,000
where are they?

645
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,450
<font color="#ffff00">LEGOLAS</font>: These bats are bred
for one purpose.

646
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,360
For what?

647
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,460
For war.

648
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:54,310
You should be inside...

649
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:55,580
Oh!

650
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,410
Out of the wind.

651
01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:00,450
No, I, uh...

652
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:01,880
Needed some air.

653
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:04,320
Place still stinks of dragon.

654
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,330
The elves have been moving
their archers into position.

655
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:14,500
Ah.

656
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,070
The battle will be over
by tomorrow's Eve...

657
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:21,640
Though I doubt
we will live to see it.

658
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:28,310
These are... Dark days.

659
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:31,550
Dark days indeed.

660
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,090
No one could blame a soul

661
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:39,390
for wishing themselves
elsewhere.

662
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,260
Must be near midnight.

663
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,130
Bombur's got the next watch.

664
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:52,170
It'll take a bit to wake him.

665
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,540
Bofur...

666
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,710
I will see you in the morning.

667
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:04,550
Goodbye, Bilbo.

668
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:51,590
<font color="#ffff00">GANDALF</font>: Since when has my
counsel counted for so little?

669
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:53,530
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

670
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:56,360
I think you're trying to save
your dwarvish friends.

671
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:58,200
And I admire your loyalty
to them.

672
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,370
But it does not dissuade me
from my course.

673
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:04,540
You started this, mithrandir.

674
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:08,210
You will forgive me
if I finish it.

675
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:11,180
Are the archers in position?

676
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,680
Yes, my lord.

677
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,080
Give the order.

678
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,750
If anything moves
on that mountain, kill it.

679
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,190
The dwarves are out of time.

680
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:25,360
Bowman!

681
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,560
Do you agree with this?

682
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,200
Is gold so important to you?

683
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:33,030
Would you buy it with the blood
of dwarves?!

684
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,240
It will not come to that.

685
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,540
This is a fight they cannot win.

686
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:37,240
<font color="#ffff00">Bilbo</font>: That won't stop them.

687
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:40,370
You think the dwarves
will surrender? They won't.

688
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,610
They will fight to the death
to defend their own.

689
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,210
Bilbo Baggins!

690
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:46,610
If I'm not mistaken,

691
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:50,450
this is the halfling who stole
the keys to my dungeons

692
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:52,790
from under the nose
of my guards.

693
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:57,160
Yes.

694
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,560
Sorry about that.

695
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:02,830
I came...

696
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:05,130
To give you this.

697
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:11,670
The heart of the mountain.

698
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:14,580
The king's Jewel.

699
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:18,480
And worth a king's ransom.

700
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,280
How is this yours to give?

701
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,690
I took it as my 14th share
of the treasure.

702
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:27,290
Why would you do this?

703
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:28,920
You owe us no loyalty.

704
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:30,890
I'm not doing it for you.

705
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:35,430
I know that dwarves
can be obstinate

706
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:38,000
and pigheaded and difficult.

707
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,470
They're suspicious and secretive

708
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,300
with the worst manners
you can possibly imagine.

709
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:44,770
But they are also brave

710
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:47,010
and kind...

711
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:49,110
And loyal to a fault.

712
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:51,380
I've grown very fond of 'em,

713
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,850
and I would save them if I can.

714
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:58,350
Now, Thorin values this stone
above all else.

715
01:04:58,350 --> 01:04:59,990
In exchange for its return,

716
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:02,520
I believe he will give you
what you are owed.

717
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:05,690
There will be no need for war.

718
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:12,700
- Rest up tonight.
- You must leave on the morrow.

719
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,170
What?

720
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:16,000
Get as far away from here
as possible.

721
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:17,170
- I-I'm not leaving.
- Hmm?

722
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:18,540
You picked me as the 14th man.

723
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,410
I'm not about to leave
the company now.

724
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:22,580
There is no company.
Not anymore.

725
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,310
And I don't like to think
what Thorin will do

726
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:25,810
when he finds out
what you've done.

727
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:27,150
I'm not afraid of Thorin.

728
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:28,580
Well, you should be.

729
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:32,490
Don't underestimate
the evil of gold.

730
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:35,860
Gold over which a serpent
has long brooded.

731
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:38,690
Dragon-sickness
seeps into the hearts

732
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,830
of all who come near
this mountain.

733
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:43,560
Almost all.

734
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,500
You there!

735
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,740
Find this hobbit a bed...

736
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:51,870
And fill his belly
with hot food.

737
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:53,070
Hmm?

738
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,240
He's earned it.

739
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:59,880
Hey. Keep an eye on him.

740
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,250
If he should try to leave,
you tell me.

741
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,690
<font color="#ffff00">ALFRID</font>: Move it!

742
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:09,460
Stupid hobbit.

743
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:46,460
Wakey-wakey, hobbit,
up you... Get.

744
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,150
I will put the next one
between your eyes.

745
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:24,830
Ah! Oh!

746
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:38,110
We have come to tell you
payment of your debt

747
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:42,450
has been offered and accepted.

748
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:44,290
<font color="#ffff00">THORIN</font>: What payment?

749
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:46,850
I gave you nothing.

750
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:49,690
You have nothing.

751
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,100
We have<i> this.</i>

752
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:03,000
<font color="#ffff00">Kili</font>: They have the Arkenstone.

753
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:05,640
Thieves!

754
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:09,240
How came you by the heirloom
of our house?!

755
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:12,010
That stone belongs to the king!

756
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:14,080
And the king may have it...

757
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,390
With our goodwill.

758
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:25,560
But first
he must honor his word.

759
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:29,660
They are taking us for fools.

760
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,730
This is a ruse.

761
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,270
A filthy lie.

762
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:39,410
The Arkenstone
is in this mountain!

763
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:41,280
It is a trick!

764
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,350
<font color="#ffff00">Bilbo</font>: I-it's no trick.

765
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:46,410
The stone is real.

766
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:48,920
I gave it to them.

767
01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:58,130
You?

768
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:04,030
I took it as my 14th share.

769
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:06,470
You would steal from me?

770
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:08,100
Steal from you? No.

771
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,540
No, I may be a burglar,

772
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:12,540
but I like to think
I'm an honest one.

773
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,440
I'm willing to let it stand
against my claim.

774
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:19,480
Against your claim?

775
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,050
Your claim.

776
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:26,120
You have no claim over me,
you miserable rat!

777
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:30,420
I was going to give it to you.

778
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:33,930
Many times I wanted to, but...

779
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:36,330
But what, thief?

780
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:38,130
You are changed, Thorin.

781
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:39,900
The dwarf I met in bag end

782
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,800
would never have gone back
on his word.

783
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:46,010
Would never have doubted
the loyalty of his kin!

784
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:51,880
Do not speak to me of loyalty.

785
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:56,150
Throw him from the rampart!

786
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:06,360
Did you not hear me?!

787
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,130
I will do it myself.

788
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:13,330
- Curse you!
- No!

789
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,600
Cursed be the wizard that forced
you on this company!

790
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:18,210
Gandalf:
If you don't like my burglar,

791
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:20,440
then please don't damage him.

792
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,810
Return him to me.

793
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:29,480
You're not making
a very splendid figure

794
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:32,620
as king under the mountain,
are you,

795
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:36,120
Thorin, son of thrain?

796
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:45,000
<font color="#ffff00">THORIN</font>: Never again will
I have dealings with wizards...

797
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,300
Go!

798
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,600
Or shire rats!

799
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:54,310
<font color="#ffff00">BARD</font>: Are we resolved?

800
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:58,280
The return of the Arkenstone
for what was promised?

801
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:11,960
Why should I buy back
that which is rightfully mine?

802
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:16,660
Keep the stone. Sell it.

803
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:20,370
Ecthelion of gondor will give
you a good price for it.

804
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:21,600
I will kill you!

805
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,840
Upon my oath,
I will kill you all!

806
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,940
Your oath means nothing!

807
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,910
I have heard enough.

808
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,060
Thorin, lay down your arms.

809
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:43,960
Open these doors.

810
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,730
This treasure will be
your death.

811
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:52,130
Sire, we cannot win this fight.

812
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:03,780
<font color="#ffff00">Bard</font>: Give us your answer.

813
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:07,620
Will you have peace...

814
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:10,050
Or war?

815
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:24,230
I will have war.

816
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,810
Ironfoot.

817
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:59,870
Ay! Thorin!

818
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:03,040
Ironfoot has come!

819
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:11,880
Who is that?
He doesn't look very happy.

820
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,950
It is dain,
lord of the iron hills.

821
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:17,850
- Thorin's cousin.
- Are they alike?

822
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:23,390
I have always found Thorin
the more reasonable of the two.

823
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:34,130
Good morning.

824
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,040
How are we all?

825
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:40,510
I have a wee proposition

826
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:45,510
if you wouldn't mind giving me
a few moments of your time.

827
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:48,920
Would ya consider...

828
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:51,420
Just sodding off?!

829
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:53,690
All of you!

830
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:55,490
Right now!

831
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:56,590
Stand fast.

832
01:13:56,590 --> 01:14:00,360
Oh, come now, lord dain.

833
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,400
Gandalf the grey.

834
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:06,200
Tell this rabble to leave

835
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,340
or I'll water the ground
with their blood!

836
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:13,840
There is no need for war

837
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,780
between dwarves, men and elves.

838
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:19,850
A legion of orcs
march on the mountain.

839
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:21,250
Stand your army down.

840
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:24,020
I will not stand down
before any elf.

841
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:27,790
Not least this faithless
woodland sprite.

842
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:32,390
He wishes nothing but ill
upon my people.

843
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:36,360
If he chooses to stand
between me and my kin

844
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:39,970
I'll split his pretty head open!

845
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:44,540
See if he's still smirking then.

846
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,210
Dain!

847
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:49,540
Oi!

848
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:53,580
Oh.

849
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:54,950
Let them advance.

850
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:56,750
See how far they get.

851
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:59,890
Ya think I give a dead dog
for your threats,

852
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:02,220
you pointy-eared Princess?!

853
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:06,230
Ya hear that, lads? We're on!

854
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:09,100
Let's give these bastards
a good hammering!

855
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,100
Stand your men down.

856
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:17,870
I'll deal with ironfoot
and his rabble.

857
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:24,650
Right, then.

858
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:26,750
Let's get this done.

859
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:29,350
Send in the goats!

860
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:48,170
Thranduil! This is madness!

861
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:13,630
Hey! How do you like that,
you old twirly-whirlies?!

862
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:15,130
Ha ha, you buggers!

863
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,500
Were-worms.

864
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:34,940
Oh, come on!

865
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:08,040
The hordes of hell are upon us!
Fight to the death!

866
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:21,490
<font color="#ffff00">FILI</font>: I'm going over the wall.
Who's coming with me?

867
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:22,420
- <font color="#ffff00">OIN</font>: Aye!
- Yes!

868
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:23,760
<font color="#ffff00">Dwalin</font>: Come on! Let's go!

869
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,460
- Stand down.
- What?

870
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:27,260
<font color="#ffff00">Fili</font>: Are we to do nothing?

871
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:31,260
<font color="#ffff00">Thorin</font>: I said, stand down!

872
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,170
The elves.

873
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:37,340
Will they not fight?

874
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,360
<font color="#ffff00">BILBO</font>: Uh, Gandalf.

875
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:39,430
Is this a good place to stand?

876
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,150
Azog.

877
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:07,750
He's trying to cut us off.

878
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:16,660
All of you!
Fall back to Dale! Now!

879
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:21,770
<font color="#ffff00">GANDALF</font>: To the city! Bilbo!

880
01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:24,170
This way!

881
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:20,890
Ugh!

882
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:35,010
Sigrid!

883
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:36,910
Tilda!

884
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:49,020
My children!
Where are my children?!

885
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,190
I saw them!

886
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:52,190
They were down
in the old market!

887
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:54,030
The market?

888
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:55,700
Where are they now?!

889
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:57,400
Tilda! Sigrid!

890
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,700
Bard! Orcs are storming
over the causeway!

891
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,900
Get the bowmen
to the eastern parapet.

892
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,870
Hold them off
for as long as you can.

893
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:06,610
Archers! This way!

894
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:09,280
The orcs have taken
stone street!

895
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,440
The market's overrun!

896
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:17,450
The rest of you, follow me!

897
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:41,410
<font color="#ffff00">ALFRID</font>: Charge!

898
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:44,310
Onward! To the death!

899
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,010
Da!

900
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,350
We're down here!

901
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:49,980
Bain! Sigrid! Get down!

902
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:40,860
Listen!

903
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:43,530
I need you to gather the women
and children.

904
01:25:43,530 --> 01:25:47,030
Take them to the great hall
and barricade the door.

905
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,470
You understand?

906
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:50,970
You must not come out
for any reason.

907
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:52,410
We want to stay with you!

908
01:25:52,410 --> 01:25:54,970
Show your father some respect!

909
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:57,310
You leave it to me, sire.

910
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:58,710
You heard him.

911
01:25:58,710 --> 01:26:00,210
We make for the great hall.

912
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:02,050
Alfrid...

913
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:03,720
Women and children only.

914
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:06,720
I need every man fighting.
See that you return.

915
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,890
I'll get them to safety, sire.

916
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:13,890
Then my sword is yours
to command.

917
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,160
Get up!

918
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,800
- Look after them.
- All right.

919
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:21,500
Shift it, granny!

920
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,050
Make for the great hall!

921
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:39,420
Out of my way!

922
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:41,820
Abandon the cripples!

923
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:43,980
Ya buggers!

924
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,670
Where's Thorin?

925
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:01,730
We need him! Where is he?!

926
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:18,080
Fall back!

927
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:50,050
Since when do we forsake
our own people?

928
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:54,620
Thorin,
- they are dying out there.

929
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:04,630
There are halls beneath halls
within this mountain.

930
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:07,770
Places we can fortify,

931
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:10,270
shore up, make safe.

932
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:12,410
Yes.

933
01:29:12,410 --> 01:29:16,310
Yes, that is it.

934
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:19,980
We must move the gold further
underground to safety.

935
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:22,980
Did you not hear me?
Dain is surrounded.

936
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:25,720
They're being slaughtered,
Thorin.

937
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:29,460
Many die in war.

938
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:32,230
Life is cheap.

939
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,160
But a treasure such as this

940
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:40,070
cannot be counted in lives lost.

941
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:46,870
It is worth all the blood
we can spend.

942
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:53,950
You sit here in these vast halls
with a crown upon your head

943
01:29:53,950 --> 01:29:58,720
and yet you are lesser now
than you have ever been.

944
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:02,190
Do not speak to me...

945
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:05,960
As if I were
some lowly dwarf lord,

946
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:10,300
as if I were still...

947
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:17,670
Thorin Oakenshield.

948
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:20,640
I am your king!

949
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,080
You were always my king.

950
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,980
You used to know that once.

951
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:29,880
You cannot see
what you have become.

952
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:33,090
Go.

953
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:37,060
Get out.

954
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:42,160
Before I kill you.

955
01:30:55,280 --> 01:31:00,010
<font color="#ffff00">DWALIN</font>: <i>You sit here

963
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,030
<i>And ours alone.</i>

964
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:21,870
<i>I will not part...</i>

965
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:25,040

01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,280
<i>more than your honor?</i>

983
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,410
<font color="#ffff00">Thorin</font>: <i>I am not my grandfather.</i>

984
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:24,600
<font color="#ffff00">GANDALF</font>: <i>This treasure
will be your death!</i>

985
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:39,280
Aah!

986
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,350
Aah!

987
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,520
Aah!

988
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:07,040
Fall back!

989
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,580
Fall back! To the mountain!

990
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:15,050
Fall back!

991
01:33:57,030 --> 01:34:00,290
I will not hide
behind a wall of stone

992
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:04,030
while others fight
our battles for us!

993
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:11,200
It is not in my blood, Thorin.

994
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:16,040
No.

995
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:18,980
It is not.

996
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:22,050
We are sons of Durin.

997
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:30,490
And Durin's folk do not flee
from a fight.

998
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:57,350
I have no right to ask this
of any of you.

999
01:35:01,090 --> 01:35:04,590
But will you follow me...

1000
01:35:04,590 --> 01:35:07,360
One last time?

1001
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:49,570
Thorin.

1002
01:35:51,810 --> 01:35:53,610
Thorin.

1003
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:22,740
<font color="#ffff00">DAIN</font>: To the king!

1004
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:26,170
To the king!

1005
01:36:26,170 --> 01:36:31,180
D'abakkur!

1006
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:49,700
The dwarves.

1007
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:51,760
They're rallying.

1008
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:58,270
They're rallying to their king.

1009
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:15,920
Any man who wants to give
their last, follow me!

1010
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,730
Come on, Bombur! Get up!

1011
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:43,650
Huh?

1012
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:04,970
Nori!

1013
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:07,670
Dori! Right behind you, brother!

1014
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:53,820
I say we stand with our men
in life and in death.

1015
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:54,920
I'm with you.

1016
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:56,260
Arm yourselves.

1017
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:58,490
Come with us, love. No, no, no.

1018
01:38:58,490 --> 01:39:00,190
You leave an old woman be.

1019
01:39:00,190 --> 01:39:01,330
Don't be afraid.

1020
01:39:01,330 --> 01:39:04,100
<font color="#ffff00">Alfrid</font>: I said, get off!

1021
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:06,230
Alfrid lickspittle.

1022
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:08,570
- You are a coward.
- "Coward"?

1023
01:39:08,570 --> 01:39:11,700
Not every man's brave enough
to wear a corset.

1024
01:39:11,710 --> 01:39:12,840
You're not a man.

1025
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:14,510
You're a weasel.

1026
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:47,770
Dain!

1027
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:49,440
Thorin!

1028
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,310
Hold on! I'm coming!

1029
01:40:00,050 --> 01:40:02,490
Hey, cousin!

1030
01:40:02,490 --> 01:40:04,120
What took you so long?

1031
01:40:04,130 --> 01:40:07,560
Ah.

1032
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:11,060
There's too many of
these buggers, Thorin.

1033
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:13,230
I hope you've got a plan.

1034
01:40:13,230 --> 01:40:16,400
Aye.

1035
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,570
We're going to take out
their leader.

1036
01:40:18,570 --> 01:40:20,510
Azog.

1037
01:40:23,410 --> 01:40:26,510
I'm gonna kill
that piece of filth.

1038
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:28,450
Thorin, you cannot do this.

1039
01:40:28,450 --> 01:40:29,750
You're our king.

1040
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:32,020
That is why I must do it.

1041
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:35,120
And how do you plan
to fight your way

1042
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:37,360
single-handed to ravenhill?

1043
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,800
It's been a while
since I've done this.

1044
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,300
On! To ravenhill!

1045
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:51,940
Hold tight, lads!

1046
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:54,440
You're all mad bastards!

1047
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:57,340
You might make it.

1048
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:01,610
May Durin save you all.

1049
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:44,590
Watch out!

1050
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:54,130
Eyes front, lads!

1051
01:42:02,410 --> 01:42:04,740
Hold on!

1052
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:06,810
Aaah!

1053
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:12,750
I'm out!

1054
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:24,100
Bring it down! Shoot it!

1055
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:25,230
Where?

1056
01:42:25,230 --> 01:42:27,270
Aim at its jambags!

1057
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:29,640
It doesn't have any jambags!

1058
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:35,410
Move it!

1059
01:42:35,410 --> 01:42:37,940
<font color="#ffff00">BOFUR</font>: Hang on, lads!
I'm coming!

1060
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:52,120
Bofur, you beauty!

1061
01:42:58,470 --> 01:43:01,130
- Dwalin!
- Keep going!

1062
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:08,240
Come on, you hairy hedgepig!

1063
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:10,140
Come on!

1064
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:19,650
Wargs!

1065
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:30,930
Hyah!

1066
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,200
Ohh!

1067
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:53,190
There's more coming!

1068
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:58,660
We're pulling too much weight.

1069
01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:00,330
We won't make it.

1070
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:01,690
Cut the tracers.

1071
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,060
Ride them to ravenhill.

1072
01:44:05,070 --> 01:44:07,100
No, balin.

1073
01:44:08,470 --> 01:44:11,100
My goat-riding days are over.

1074
01:44:12,810 --> 01:44:14,870
Durin be with you.

1075
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:46,310
I am too old for this!

1076
01:44:47,410 --> 01:44:49,840
Hyah! Onward!

1077
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:52,740
Lead on!

1078
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:24,380
Get up.

1079
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:26,650
Get away from me.

1080
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:28,450
I don't take orders from you.

1081
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:29,550
People trusted you.

1082
01:45:29,550 --> 01:45:30,950
They listened to you.

1083
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:33,950
The master's mantle
was there for the taking.

1084
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:37,290
And you threw it all away.

1085
01:45:37,290 --> 01:45:39,630
Boom.

1086
01:45:47,330 --> 01:45:48,770
Alfrid...

1087
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:50,800
Your slip is showing.

1088
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:37,020
Oh!

1089
01:46:39,450 --> 01:46:40,850
Aaah!

1090
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:01,410
Aaaah!

1091
01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:22,430
We may yet survive this.

1092
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:24,600
Gandalf!

1093
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:26,300
Ugh!

1094
01:47:32,370 --> 01:47:33,340
It's Thorin!

1095
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:35,410
And Fili, Kili

1096
01:47:35,410 --> 01:47:38,040
and Dwalin.

1097
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:40,450
He's taking his best warriors.

1098
01:47:40,450 --> 01:47:41,850
To do what?

1099
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:45,780
To cut the head off the snake.

1100
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:19,890
Die!

1101
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:28,390
Gandalf!

1102
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,330
Legolas.

1103
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:32,730
Legolas Greenleaf.

1104
01:48:32,730 --> 01:48:33,970
There is a second army.

1105
01:48:33,970 --> 01:48:36,300
Bolg leads a force
of gundabad orcs.

1106
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:37,640
They are almost upon us.

1107
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:39,670
Gundabad.

1108
01:48:39,670 --> 01:48:42,370
This was their plan all along.

1109
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:45,480
Azog engages our forces,

1110
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:48,480
then bolg sweeps in
from the north.

1111
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,980
Wha... th-the north?

1112
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:52,320
Where is the north exactly?

1113
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:53,920
Ravenhill.

1114
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:56,320
Ravenhill?

1115
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,090
Thorin is up there.

1116
01:48:58,090 --> 01:49:00,430
And Fili and Kili.
They're all up there.

1117
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:19,010
<font color="#ffff00">KILI</font>: Where is he?

1118
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:25,550
It looks empty.

1119
01:49:25,550 --> 01:49:28,020
I think Azog has fled.

1120
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:30,520
I don't think so.

1121
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:36,960
Fili, take your brother.

1122
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:38,530
Scout out the towers.

1123
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:41,030
Keep low and out of sight.

1124
01:49:41,030 --> 01:49:43,030
If you see something,
report back.

1125
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,000
Do not engage.
Do you understand?

1126
01:49:45,010 --> 01:49:46,640
We have company.

1127
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:48,870
Goblin mercenaries.

1128
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,310
No more than a hundred.

1129
01:49:50,310 --> 01:49:52,480
We'll take care of them. Go!

1130
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:54,480
Go!

1131
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:56,720
Come on!

1132
01:49:58,350 --> 01:50:00,990
Die!

1133
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:26,680
Recall your company.

1134
01:50:32,350 --> 01:50:33,450
My lord!

1135
01:50:33,450 --> 01:50:35,520
Dispatch this force
to ravenhill.

1136
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,690
The dwarves are
about to be overrun.

1137
01:50:37,690 --> 01:50:38,760
Thorin must be warned.

1138
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:41,190
By all means, warn him.

1139
01:50:41,190 --> 01:50:42,930
I have spent enough elvish blood

1140
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:44,760
in defense of
this accursed land.

1141
01:50:44,770 --> 01:50:47,370
- No more.
- Thranduil?

1142
01:50:47,370 --> 01:50:48,870
I'll go.

1143
01:50:48,870 --> 01:50:51,100
Don't be ridiculous.

1144
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:53,570
- You'll never make it.
- Why not?

1145
01:50:53,570 --> 01:50:57,110
Because they will see you coming
and kill you.

1146
01:50:57,110 --> 01:50:59,480
No, they won't.

1147
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,880
They won't see me.

1148
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:04,980
It's out of the question.

1149
01:51:04,990 --> 01:51:06,920
I won't allow it.

1150
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:10,990
I'm not asking you
to allow it, Gandalf.

1151
01:51:48,830 --> 01:51:51,600
You will not turn away.

1152
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,930
Not this time.

1153
01:51:52,930 --> 01:51:55,800
Get out of my way.

1154
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:57,670
The dwarves will be slaughtered.

1155
01:51:57,670 --> 01:51:59,940
Yes, they will die.

1156
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:03,680
Today, tomorrow,

1157
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:06,680
one year hence,
a hundred years from now.

1158
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:08,850
What does it matter?

1159
01:52:08,850 --> 01:52:10,620
They are mortal.

1160
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:15,490
You think your life is worth
more than theirs

1161
01:52:15,490 --> 01:52:18,860
when there is no love in it?

1162
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:23,030
There is no love in you.

1163
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,470
What do you know of love?

1164
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:32,300
Nothing.

1165
01:52:32,310 --> 01:52:35,410
What you feel for that dwarf
is not real.

1166
01:52:37,310 --> 01:52:41,680
You think it is love?
Are you ready to die for it?

1167
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:56,760
I will go with you.

1168
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,310
Aaaah!

1169
01:53:19,690 --> 01:53:21,750
Pull!

1170
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:38,970
Bifur, you've lost your ax.

1171
01:53:38,970 --> 01:53:40,540
Aah!

1172
01:53:40,540 --> 01:53:41,940
No, he's not.

1173
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:43,780
Here you go, cousin.

1174
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:48,210
You know where
you can stick that.

1175
01:53:59,230 --> 01:54:02,590
Stay here.
Search the lower levels.

1176
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:05,200
I've got this.

1177
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:16,310
Where is that orc filth?

1178
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:19,510
Thorin.

1179
01:54:19,510 --> 01:54:20,650
Bilbo.

1180
01:54:20,650 --> 01:54:22,610
You have to leave here. Now.

1181
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:24,750
Azog has another army
attacking from the north.

1182
01:54:24,750 --> 01:54:26,850
This watchtower will be
completely surrounded.

1183
01:54:26,850 --> 01:54:28,250
There'll be no way out.

1184
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:30,290
- We are so close.
- That orc scum is in there.

1185
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:33,860
I say we push on.
No! That's what he wants.

1186
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:36,390
He wants to draw us in.

1187
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:38,860
This is a trap.

1188
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:56,650
Find Fili and Kili.
Call them back.

1189
01:54:56,650 --> 01:54:58,650
Thorin,
- are you sure about this?

1190
01:54:58,650 --> 01:55:00,790
Do it.

1191
01:55:00,790 --> 01:55:03,690
We'll live to fight another day.

1192
01:55:25,580 --> 01:55:26,910
Oh.

1193
01:55:37,660 --> 01:55:40,230
Go!

1194
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:45,700
Run!

1195
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:46,760
Ugh!

1196
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:17,430
Kili!

1197
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:19,930
<font color="#ffff00">DWALIN</font>: Thorin!

1198
01:56:19,930 --> 01:56:23,430
Thorin. No!

1199
01:57:45,990 --> 01:57:47,390
No.

1200
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:05,570
<font color="#ffff00">TAURIEL</font>: Kili.

1201
01:59:18,410 --> 01:59:20,880
Ugh!

1202
02:00:13,930 --> 02:00:15,830
Kili!

1203
02:00:20,370 --> 02:00:21,840
Kili!

1204
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:23,940
Tauriel!

1205
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:25,310
Kili.

1206
02:00:27,110 --> 02:00:29,010
Ugh!

1207
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:31,410
No!

1208
02:01:42,060 --> 02:01:43,120
No!

1209
02:07:20,590 --> 02:07:23,130
Tauriel!

1210
02:09:05,460 --> 02:09:06,730
Aah!

1211
02:10:32,550 --> 02:10:37,450
Aah!

1212
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:18,720
The eagles are coming.

1213
02:13:08,870 --> 02:13:09,710
Bilbo!

1214
02:13:09,710 --> 02:13:11,040
Don't move. Don't move.

1215
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:12,080
Lie still.

1216
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:15,950
Oh. Mnh. Mnh.

1217
02:13:15,950 --> 02:13:17,280
I'm glad you are here.

1218
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:19,450
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

1219
02:13:19,450 --> 02:13:23,390
- I wish to part from you in friendship.
- No.

1220
02:13:23,390 --> 02:13:25,060
You are not going anywhere,
Thorin.

1221
02:13:25,060 --> 02:13:26,890
You're going to live.

1222
02:13:26,890 --> 02:13:31,830
I would take back my words
and my deeds at the gate.

1223
02:13:31,830 --> 02:13:35,730
You did what only a true friend
would do.

1224
02:13:35,730 --> 02:13:37,570
Forgive me.

1225
02:13:39,140 --> 02:13:43,570
I was too blind to see it.

1226
02:13:43,580 --> 02:13:45,980
I am so sorry

1227
02:13:45,980 --> 02:13:48,750
that I have led you
into such peril.

1228
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:53,250
No, I'm... I'm glad to have
shared in your perils, Thorin.

1229
02:13:53,250 --> 02:13:54,990
Each and every one of them.

1230
02:13:56,960 --> 02:14:01,390
- It is far more.
- Than any Baggins deserves.

1231
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:06,830
Farewell...

1232
02:14:06,830 --> 02:14:10,170
Master burglar.

1233
02:14:10,170 --> 02:14:13,340
Go back to your books.

1234
02:14:13,340 --> 02:14:16,940
And your armchair.

1235
02:14:16,940 --> 02:14:20,280
Plant your trees.

1236
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:23,050
Watch them grow.

1237
02:14:25,220 --> 02:14:29,320
If more people...

1238
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:34,360
Valued home above gold...

1239
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:39,530
This world would be
a merrier place.

1240
02:14:41,830 --> 02:14:44,470
No. No, no, no, no. No.

1241
02:14:44,470 --> 02:14:47,000
Thorin. Thorin, don't you dare.

1242
02:14:49,070 --> 02:14:50,710
Thorin.

1243
02:14:55,710 --> 02:14:58,550
Thorin. Thorin. Hold on.

1244
02:14:58,550 --> 02:15:00,350
Hold on, please.

1245
02:15:00,350 --> 02:15:02,150
The eagles...

1246
02:15:02,150 --> 02:15:05,020
The eagles...
The eagles are here.

1247
02:15:05,020 --> 02:15:06,720
Thorin?

1248
02:15:09,160 --> 02:15:12,060
The ea...

1249
02:16:06,950 --> 02:16:11,050
I...Cannot go back.

1250
02:16:11,060 --> 02:16:12,660
Where will you go?

1251
02:16:14,390 --> 02:16:16,390
I do not know.

1252
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:19,160
Go north.

1253
02:16:19,160 --> 02:16:21,600
Find the dúnedain.

1254
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:24,300
There's a young ranger
amongst them.

1255
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:25,670
You should meet him.

1256
02:16:25,670 --> 02:16:29,740
His father, arathorn,
was a good man.

1257
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:35,150
His son might grow
to be a great one.

1258
02:16:36,950 --> 02:16:38,750
What is his name?

1259
02:16:38,750 --> 02:16:42,590
He's known in the wild
as strider.

1260
02:16:42,590 --> 02:16:47,660
His true name you must discover
for yourself.

1261
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:53,330
Legolas.

1262
02:16:53,330 --> 02:16:57,430
Your mother loved you.

1263
02:16:57,440 --> 02:17:00,140
More than anyone.

1264
02:17:00,140 --> 02:17:02,570
More than life.

1265
02:17:36,810 --> 02:17:40,310
They want to bury him.

1266
02:17:40,310 --> 02:17:43,810
Yes.

1267
02:17:43,820 --> 02:17:48,080
If this is love,
I do not want it.

1268
02:17:50,660 --> 02:17:53,160
Take it from me.

1269
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:55,890
Please.

1270
02:17:59,330 --> 02:18:03,370
Why does it hurt so much?

1271
02:18:03,370 --> 02:18:07,140
Because it was real.

1272
02:19:32,020 --> 02:19:35,390
Mm.

1273
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:17,690
<font color="#ffff00">Gandalf</font>: The king is dead.

1274
02:22:17,690 --> 02:22:20,920
Long live the king!

1275
02:22:20,930 --> 02:22:22,830
<font color="#ffff00">All</font>: Long live the king!

1276
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:33,700
There is to be
a great feast tonight.

1277
02:22:33,710 --> 02:22:35,340
Songs will be sung.

1278
02:22:35,340 --> 02:22:38,110
Tales will be told.

1279
02:22:38,110 --> 02:22:40,110
And Thorin Oakenshield

1280
02:22:40,110 --> 02:22:43,180
will pass into legend.

1281
02:22:43,180 --> 02:22:45,380
I know that's how
you must honor him.

1282
02:22:45,380 --> 02:22:47,950
But to me, he was never that.

1283
02:22:47,950 --> 02:22:50,290
He was...

1284
02:22:50,290 --> 02:22:54,460
To me...

1285
02:22:54,460 --> 02:22:55,860
He was...

1286
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,900
Well, I think
I'll slip quietly away.

1287
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:05,900
Will you tell the others
I said goodbye?

1288
02:23:05,900 --> 02:23:08,370
You can tell them yourself.

1289
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:26,590
Uh, if any of you are ever
passing bag end,

1290
02:23:26,590 --> 02:23:28,090
uh...

1291
02:23:31,860 --> 02:23:34,000
tea is at 4:00.

1292
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:38,170
There's plenty of it.

1293
02:23:38,170 --> 02:23:42,010
You are welcome anytime.

1294
02:23:46,750 --> 02:23:49,680
Uh...

1295
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:52,020
Don't bother knocking.

1296
02:24:34,230 --> 02:24:38,390
- Ah.
- The borders of the shire.

1297
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:41,060
It is here I must leave you.

1298
02:24:42,970 --> 02:24:45,370
That's a shame.

1299
02:24:47,010 --> 02:24:51,070
I quite like
having a wizard around.

1300
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:54,180
Seems they bring good luck.

1301
02:24:54,180 --> 02:24:56,410
You don't really suppose,
do you,

1302
02:24:56,410 --> 02:24:58,250
that all your adventures
and escapes

1303
02:24:58,250 --> 02:25:00,480
were managed by mere luck?

1304
02:25:00,490 --> 02:25:03,590
Magic rings should not be used
lightly, Bilbo.

1305
02:25:03,590 --> 02:25:06,360
Don't take me for a fool.

1306
02:25:06,360 --> 02:25:08,760
- I know you found one...
- No, no...

1307
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:10,260
in the goblin tunnels.

1308
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:13,700
And I've kept my eye on you
ever since.

1309
02:25:15,670 --> 02:25:17,500
Well, thank goodness.

1310
02:25:21,470 --> 02:25:24,670
Farewell, Gandalf.

1311
02:25:26,540 --> 02:25:28,210
Farewell.

1312
02:25:35,050 --> 02:25:37,620
You, uh... needn't worry
about that ring.

1313
02:25:37,620 --> 02:25:40,520
It fell out of
my pocket during the battle.

1314
02:25:40,530 --> 02:25:41,620
I lost it.

1315
02:25:41,630 --> 02:25:46,230
You are a very fine person,
Mr. Baggins.

1316
02:25:46,230 --> 02:25:50,230
And I'm very fond of you.

1317
02:25:50,240 --> 02:25:53,800
But you're only
quite a little fellow

1318
02:25:53,810 --> 02:25:57,610
in a wide world after all.

1319
02:26:27,740 --> 02:26:31,510
Wait a minute,
- that's my mother's glory box.

1320
02:26:31,510 --> 02:26:34,180
And that's my dining chair.

1321
02:26:34,180 --> 02:26:36,850
Ah! Put that pouf down!

1322
02:26:36,850 --> 02:26:39,020
What is going on?

1323
02:26:39,020 --> 02:26:41,120
Hello, Mr. Bilbo.

1324
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:43,720
You're not supposed to be here.

1325
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:45,420
What do you mean?

1326
02:26:45,420 --> 02:26:47,520
- On account of you.
- Being presumed dead and all.

1327
02:26:47,530 --> 02:26:49,690
I am not dead.

1328
02:26:49,690 --> 02:26:52,400
Presumed or otherwise.

1329
02:26:52,400 --> 02:26:54,800
I'm not sure that's permitted.

1330
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:56,900
Mr. Bilbo!

1331
02:26:56,900 --> 02:26:58,200
<font color="#ffff00">TOSSER GRUBB</font>: 21!

1332
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:01,370
Any advance on 21?
Any advance on 21?

1333
02:27:01,370 --> 02:27:04,270
Sold to Mrs. bolger.

1334
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:06,710
Somewhere for fatty
to put his feet on.

1335
02:27:08,880 --> 02:27:12,750
So do I have any bids for this?
This is shire-made.

1336
02:27:12,750 --> 02:27:14,480
None of your dwarvish
reproductions here.

1337

<font color="#ffff00">Our next... BILBO</font>: Stop!

1338
02:27:16,220 --> 02:27:18,650
Stop! There's been a mistake!

1339
02:27:18,660 --> 02:27:21,220
Who are you? What do
you mean, who am I?

1340
02:27:21,230 --> 02:27:22,990
You know perfectly well
who I am,

1341
02:27:22,990 --> 02:27:25,060
lobelia sackville-Baggins.

1342
02:27:25,060 --> 02:27:26,560
This is my home!

1343
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:28,930
And those are my spoons.
Thank you very much.

1344
02:27:28,930 --> 02:27:31,930
Tosser grubb: This is most irregular.
Excuse me.

1345
02:27:31,940 --> 02:27:35,000
It's been more than 13 months
since the disappearance.

1346
02:27:35,010 --> 02:27:37,940
If you are in fact
Bilbo Baggins,

1347
02:27:37,940 --> 02:27:41,740
and undeceased,
can you prove it?

1348
02:27:41,750 --> 02:27:42,780
What?!

1349
02:27:42,780 --> 02:27:44,010
Well, something official

1350
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:46,020
with your name on it
would suffice.

1351
02:27:46,020 --> 02:27:48,420
All right. Right.

1352
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:55,120
A contract of employment
as a... a b...

1353
02:27:55,130 --> 02:27:56,930
Never mind as what.

1354
02:27:56,930 --> 02:28:00,000
There. My signature.

1355
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:01,930
Yes, well...

1356
02:28:01,930 --> 02:28:04,530
Uh, well, it certainly
seems to be in order.

1357
02:28:04,540 --> 02:28:06,000
Yes.

1358
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,200
Seems there can be no doubt.

1359
02:28:08,210 --> 02:28:11,110
Who is this person you pledged
your service to?

1360
02:28:11,110 --> 02:28:14,780
Thorin Oakenshield?

1361
02:28:17,220 --> 02:28:21,680
He... he was my friend.

1362
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:18,130
No, thank you!

1363
02:30:18,140 --> 02:30:19,800
We don't want any more visitors,

1364
02:30:19,800 --> 02:30:22,970
well-wishers
or distant relations!

1365
02:30:22,970 --> 02:30:27,880
<font color="#ffff00">GANDALF</font>: And what about
very old friends?

1366
02:30:33,150 --> 02:30:34,850

1367
02:30:34,850 --> 02:30:36,420
Bilbo Baggins.

1368
02:30:36,420 --> 02:30:38,920
My dear Gandalf!

1369
02:30:38,920 --> 02:30:40,090
It's good to see you.

1370
02:30:41,290 --> 02:30:42,590
111 years old.

1371
02:30:42,590 --> 02:30:44,930
Who would believe it?

1372
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:49,770
Come on, come in!

1373
02:30:49,770 --> 02:30:52,770
Welcome. Welcome.
