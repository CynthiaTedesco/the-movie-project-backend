How can you be on
the council...

671
00:37:25,705 --> 00:37:26,877
and not be a master?

672
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:28,916
Take a seat...

673
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,313
Young Skywalker.

674
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:35,101
Forgive me, Master.

675
00:37:39,711 --> 00:37:41,682
KI-ADI-MUNDI: We have
surveyed all systems...

676
00:37:41,707 --> 00:37:42,867
in the Republic,

677
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,531
but have found no sign...

678
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:45,805
of General Grievous.

679
00:37:46,195 --> 00:37:47,834
Hiding in the outer rim...

680
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,951
Grievous is.

681
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:50,715
The outlying systems...

682
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,984
you must sweep.

683
00:37:52,545 --> 00:37:54,469
We do not have
many ships to spare.

684
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:56,524
What about the droid
attack on the Wookiees?

685
00:37:57,866 --> 00:37:59,522
WINDU: It is critical we
send an attack group...

686
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:00,639
there immediately.

687
00:38:00,664 --> 00:38:01,644
He's right.

688
00:38:01,669 --> 00:38:03,737
It's a system we
cannot afford to lose.

689
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:06,695
Go, I will.

690
00:38:07,798 --> 00:38:08,912
Good relations with...

691
00:38:08,937 --> 00:38:10,217
the Wookiees I have.

692
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,291
It's settled in.

693
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:14,438
Yoda will take a battalion...

694
00:38:14,463 --> 00:38:16,022
of clones to reinforce
the Wookiees...

695
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:17,061
on Kashyyyk.

696
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:19,292
May the Force be with us all.

697
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:23,999
ANAKIN: What kind of
nonsense this is?

698
00:38:24,694 --> 00:38:26,682
Put me on the council and
not make me a master?

699
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,233
It's never been done in
the history of the Jedi.

700
00:38:29,258 --> 00:38:30,999
- It's insulting.
- Oh, calm down, Anakin.

701
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,601
You have been given
a great honor.

702
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,592
To be on the council
at your age-

703
00:38:34,617 --> 00:38:36,080
it's never happened before.

704
00:38:37,343 --> 00:38:38,691
The fact of the
matter is you are

705
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,231
too close to the chancellor.

706
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,980
The council doesn't like it...

707
00:38:42,005 --> 00:38:44,131
when he interferes
in Jedi affairs.

708
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:46,226
I swear to you,

709
00:38:46,251 --> 00:38:47,906
I didn't ask to be
put on the council.

710
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,359
But it's what you wanted.

711
00:38:50,491 --> 00:38:52,327
Your friendship with
Chancellor Palpatine...

712
00:38:52,352 --> 00:38:53,664
seems to have paid off.

713
00:38:54,054 --> 00:38:55,505
That has nothing to do with this.

714
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,558
The only reason
the council...

715
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:58,945
has approved your
appointment...

716
00:38:58,946 --> 00:39:00,913
is because the
chancellor trusts you.

717
00:39:02,232 --> 00:39:03,286
And?

718
00:39:03,981 --> 00:39:05,169
Anakin, I am on your side.

719
00:39:05,194 --> 00:39:06,967
I didn't want to put
you in this situation.

720
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:08,232
What situation?

721
00:39:12,544 --> 00:39:14,363
The council wants
you to report

722
00:39:14,388 --> 00:39:16,355
on all the
chancellor's dealings.

723
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:18,310
They want to know
what he's up to.

724
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,685
ANAKIN: They want me to
spy on the chancellor.

725
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:27,795
But that's treason.

726
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,030
OBI-WAN: We are
at war, Anakin.

727
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:32,754
Why didn't the council
give me this...

728
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:34,177
assignment when we
were in session?

729
00:39:34,646 --> 00:39:36,531
This assignment does
not to be on record.

730
00:39:38,063 --> 00:39:40,157
The chancellor is not
a bad man, Obi-Wan.

731
00:39:41,036 --> 00:39:42,042
He befriended me.

732
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:44,033
He's watched out for me
ever since I arrived here.

733
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:45,818
That is why you must help us.

734
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,667
Anakin.

735
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,384
Our allegiance is
to the senate,

736
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:50,404
not to its leader,

737
00:39:50,405 --> 00:39:51,685
who has managed
to stay in office...

738
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,466
long after his
term has expired.

739
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:55,665
The senate demanded
that he stay longer.

740
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:57,282
Yes, but use your
feelings, Anakin.

741
00:39:57,307 --> 00:39:58,652
Something is out of place.

742
00:39:59,247 --> 00:40:00,294
(SIGHS)

743
00:40:00,426 --> 00:40:01,801
You're asking me
to do something...

744
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:02,871
against the Jedi code,

745
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:05,397
against the Republic,

746
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,450
against a mentor
and a friend.

747
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:08,640
That was out of place here.

748
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:11,333
Why are you asking
this of me?

749
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,185
The council is asking you.

750
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,701
Anakin did not
take to his new...

751
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:26,422
assignment with
much enthusiasm.

752
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:29,031
WINDU: It's very dangerous,

753
00:40:29,056 --> 00:40:30,459
putting them together.

754
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,243
I don't think the boy
could handle it.

755
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,607
I don't trust him.

756
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,342
With all due respect, Master...

757
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:38,857
is he not the chosen one?

758
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,702
Is he not to destroy the Sith...

759
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:43,435
and bring balance
to the Force?

760
00:40:44,232 --> 00:40:45,661
So the prophecy says.

761
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:47,865
YODA: A prophecy...

762
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:49,431
that misread...

763
00:40:49,456 --> 00:40:50,834
could have been.

764
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:54,686
He will not let me down.

765
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,553
He never has.

766
00:40:57,654 --> 00:40:59,364
I hope right you are.

767
00:41:23,654 --> 00:41:24,557
(SIGHS)

768
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:26,494
Sometimes I wonder what's...

769
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:27,725
happening to the Jedi order.

770
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:30,421
I think this war
is destroying...

771
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,684
the principles
of the Republic.

772
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:35,181
Have you ever
considered that...

773
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:36,461
we may be on the wrong side?

774
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:38,740
What do you mean?

775
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:42,297
What if the democracy
we thought

776
00:41:42,322 --> 00:41:44,008
we were serving
no longer exists,

777
00:41:44,646 --> 00:41:46,176
and the Republic has
become the very...

778
00:41:46,201 --> 00:41:47,977
evil we've been
fighting to destroy?

779
00:41:49,012 --> 00:41:50,021
I don't believe that.

780
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,466
And you're sounding
like a separatist.

781
00:41:54,628 --> 00:41:56,793
This war represents a
failure to listen.

782
00:41:57,684 --> 00:41:59,583
Now you're closer to the
chancellor than anyone.

783
00:41:59,615 --> 00:42:01,399
Please, ask him to
stop the fighting...

784
00:42:01,424 --> 00:42:02,700
and let diplomacy resume.

785
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:05,040
Don't ask me to do that.

786
00:42:07,322 --> 00:42:08,456
Make a motion in the senate,

787
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:10,263
where that kind of
a request belongs.

788
00:42:11,693 --> 00:42:13,203
- What is it?
- Nothing.

789
00:42:15,302 --> 00:42:16,305
Don't do this.

790
00:42:16,765 --> 00:42:18,553
Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

791
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:22,716
Hold me.

792
00:42:23,537 --> 00:42:25,192
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

793
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:27,920
So long ago, when there...

794
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,294
was nothing but our love.

795
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:31,807
No politics,

796
00:42:31,832 --> 00:42:33,777
no plotting, no war.

You wanted to see
me, Chancellor.

00:43:14,752 --> 00:43:15,907
Yes, Anakin.

803
00:43:15,932 --> 00:43:16,848
Come closer.

804
00:43:16,873 --> 00:43:18,036
I have good news.

805
00:43:19,951 --> 00:43:21,223
Our clone intelligence...

806
00:43:21,248 --> 00:43:22,418
units have...

807
00:43:22,443 --> 00:43:23,531
discovered the location...

808
00:43:23,556 --> 00:43:24,666
of General Grievous.

809
00:43:24,889 --> 00:43:25,818
He's hiding...

810
00:43:25,843 --> 00:43:27,180
in the Utapau system.

811
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,605
ANAKIN: At last.

812
00:43:30,098 --> 00:43:31,340
We'll be able to
capture that...

813
00:43:31,365 --> 00:43:32,839
monster and end this war.

814
00:43:34,068 --> 00:43:35,762
I would worry about
the collective...

815

for this assignment.

You're the best choice...

00:43:41,245 --> 00:43:42,244
by far.

820
00:43:44,278 --> 00:43:45,296
Mmm.

821
00:43:45,804 --> 00:43:46,805

You know I'm not able...

826

to rely on...

in their plot,
they soon will.

830

I'm not sure I understand.

831
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,153
You must sense...

832
00:44:17,178 --> 00:44:19,163
what I have come to suspect.

833
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:21,140
The Jedi Council...

834
00:44:21,165 --> 00:44:22,946
want control of the Republic.

835

They're planing to betray me.

Don't you?

840
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:43,400
I know they don't trust you.

841
00:44:43,424 --> 00:44:44,826
Hmm. Or the senate.

842
00:44:45,647 --> 00:44:46,717
Or the Republic.

843
00:44:47,446 --> 00:44:49,249
Or democracy, for
that matter.

844
00:44:50,711 --> 00:44:51,720
I have to admit...

845
00:44:52,266 --> 00:44:54,263
my trust in them
has been shaken.

846
00:44:55,556 --> 00:44:56,595
Why?

847
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,714
They asked you
to do something...

848
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,717
that made you feel
dishonest, didn't they?

849
00:45:06,094 --> 00:45:08,032
They asked you to spy
on me, didn't they?

850
00:45:13,485 --> 00:45:14,540
I don't, uh...

851
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:17,766
I don't know what to say.

852
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:19,795
Remember back to...

853
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,986
your early teachings.

854
00:45:22,305 --> 00:45:24,012
All who gain power...

855
00:45:24,515 --> 00:45:26,021
are afraid to lose it.

856
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:27,673
Even the Jedi.

857
00:45:28,165 --> 00:45:29,974
The Jedi use their
power for good.

858
00:45:30,985 --> 00:45:32,780
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

859
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:35,043
The Sith and the Jedi...

860
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:37,376
are similar in almost...

861
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,407
every way,

862
00:45:40,189 --> 00:45:41,620

863
00:45:41,645 --> 00:45:42,837
for greater power.

864
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,738
The Sith rely on their...

865
00:45:45,763 --> 00:45:47,156
passion for their strength.

866
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:49,213
They think inwards only...

867
00:45:49,238 --> 00:45:50,257
about themselves.

868
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:53,231
And the Jedi don't.

869
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,319
The Jedi are selfless.

870
00:45:56,964 --> 00:45:58,422
They only care about others.

the tragedy of...

874
00:46:11,549 --> 00:46:13,648
Darth Plagueis the Wise?

875
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,794
- No.
- I thought not.

876
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,578
It's not a story the
Jedi would tell you.

877
00:46:24,463 --> 00:46:26,052
It's a Sith legend.

878
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:28,631
Darth Plagueis...

879
00:46:29,098 --> 00:46:31,070
was a dark lord of the Sith

880
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,099
so powerful and...

881
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,406
so wise,

882
00:46:34,693 --> 00:46:36,414
he could use the Force...

883
00:46:36,439 --> 00:46:38,852
to influence the
midi-chlorians...

884
00:46:39,606 --> 00:46:40,756
to create...

885
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:42,748
life.

886
00:46:44,396 --> 00:46:46,275
He had such a knowledge...

887
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,419
of the dark side,

888
00:46:48,028 --> 00:46:49,396
he could even...

889
00:46:49,421 --> 00:46:50,761
keep the ones...

890
00:46:50,786 --> 00:46:52,005
he cared about...

891
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:54,312
from dying.

892
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,229
He could actually...

893
00:47:00,917 --> 00:47:02,316
save people from death?

894
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:05,584

What happened to him?

901
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:18,393
He became so powerful,

902
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:21,850
the only thing he was
afraid of was...

903
00:47:23,768 --> 00:47:24,917
losing his power.

904
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:27,166
Which eventually,
of course, he did.

905
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:29,772
Unfortunately...

906
00:47:30,409 --> 00:47:32,062
he taught his apprentice...

907
00:47:32,087 --> 00:47:33,492
everything he knew.

908
00:47:34,564 --> 00:47:35,746
Then his apprentice...

909
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:37,166
killed him in his sleep.

910
00:47:40,322 --> 00:47:41,401
It's ironic.

911
00:47:42,377 --> 00:47:44,157
He could save others
from death...

912
00:47:45,566 --> 00:47:47,207
but not himself.

01:01:52,507 --> 01:01:53,973
Great care...

1179
01:01:53,998 --> 01:01:55,337
we must take.

1180
01:01:56,144 --> 01:01:57,277
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)

1181
01:02:01,988 --> 01:02:03,059
Chancellor.

1182
01:02:04,277 --> 01:02:05,557
We've just received a report...

1183
01:02:05,582 --> 01:02:06,656
from Master Kenobi.

1184
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,373
He has engaged General Grievous.

1185
01:02:10,106 --> 01:02:11,821
We can only hope
that Master Kenobi...

1186
01:02:11,846 --> 01:02:12,989
is up to the challenge.

1187
01:02:15,032 --> 01:02:16,128
I should be there with him.

1188
01:02:16,973 --> 01:02:17,971
It's upsetting to me...

1189
01:02:17,996 --> 01:02:19,367
to see that the council...

1190
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:20,335
doesn't seem to fully...

1191
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,506
appreciate your talents.

1192
01:02:22,874 --> 01:02:24,017
Don't you wonder...

1193
01:02:24,316 --> 01:02:25,417
why they won't make...

1194
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:26,521
you a Jedi master?

1195
01:02:28,649 --> 01:02:29,742
I wish I knew.

1196
01:02:31,922 --> 01:02:33,699
More and more I get
the feeling that...

1197
01:02:34,575 --> 01:02:36,463
I'm being excluded
from the council.

1198
01:02:43,724 --> 01:02:45,100
I know there are
things about...

1199
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:46,819
the Force that they're
not telling me.

1200
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:51,809
They don't trust you, Anakin.

1201
01:02:53,146 --> 01:02:54,600
They see your future.

1202
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,617
They know your power...

1203
01:02:56,642 --> 01:02:58,055
will be too strong...

1204
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:58,954
to control.

1205
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:01,353
You must break through...

1206
01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:03,187
the fog of lies...

1207
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:05,115
the Jedi have
created around you.

1208
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,874
Let me help you to know...

1209
01:03:08,899 --> 01:03:10,764
the subtleties of the Force.

1210
01:03:12,613 --> 01:03:14,335
How do you know the
ways of the Force?

1211
01:03:15,496 --> 01:03:17,157
My mentor taught
me everything...

1212
01:03:17,182 --> 01:03:18,183
about the Force.

1213
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:20,544
Even the nature of...

1214
01:03:20,569 --> 01:03:21,853
the dark side.

1215
01:03:24,707 --> 01:03:25,858
You know the dark side?

1216
01:03:27,418 --> 01:03:28,614
Anakin.

1217
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:31,011
If one is to understand...

1218
01:03:31,036 --> 01:03:32,520
the great mystery,

1219
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:33,667
one must study...

1220
01:03:33,692 --> 01:03:35,059
all its aspects,

1221
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,658
not just the dogmatic...

1222
01:03:36,683 --> 01:03:38,489
narrow view of the Jedi.

1223
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:40,931
If you wish to
become a complete...

1224
01:03:40,956 --> 01:03:42,310
and wise leader,

1225
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:43,465
you must embrace...

1226
01:03:43,802 --> 01:03:45,479
a larger view of the Force.

1227
01:03:46,747 --> 01:03:48,552
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

1228
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:50,911
Only through me...

1229
01:03:50,912 --> 01:03:52,754
can you achieve a power...

1230
01:03:52,779 --> 01:03:54,700
greater than any Jedi.

1231
01:03:55,801 --> 01:03:56,978
Learn to know the...

1232
01:03:57,003 --> 01:03:58,739
dark side of the force...

1233
01:03:58,950 --> 01:03:59,836
and you'll be able...

1234
01:03:59,861 --> 01:04:01,241
to save your wife...

1235
01:04:02,192 --> 01:04:03,850
from certain death.

1236
01:04:05,786 --> 01:04:06,872
What did you say?

1237
01:04:07,856 --> 01:04:09,346
Use my knowledge,

1238
01:04:09,371 --> 01:04:10,355
I beg you.

I know what's been
troubling you.

1242
01:04:17,716 --> 01:04:18,771
Listen to me.

1243
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:21,249
Don't continue to be a...

1244
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,182
pawn of the Jedi Council.

1245
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,966
Ever since I've known you...

1246
01:04:26,991 --> 01:04:28,731
you've been searching
for a life...

1247
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,251
greater than that of
an ordinary Jedi.

1248
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:33,741
A life of significance...

1249
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:35,321

anger.

1257
01:04:52,856 --> 01:04:54,925

1258

Palpatine is a Sith lord.

Yes. The one we've

He knows the ways
of the Force.

He's been trained to
use the dark side.

is very powerful.

You'll need my help if
you're going to arrest him.

For your own good,
stay out of this affair.
