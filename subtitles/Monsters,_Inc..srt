What?

1750
01:28:19,378 --> 01:28:21,546
Well, (CHUCKLES) it is
the gosh-darnedest thing.

1751
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:23,632
Hardscrabble's letting us
into the Scare program.

1752
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:24,800
What?

1753
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:27,052
She was impressed with
our performance in the games.

1754
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:29,137
She invited us to join next semester!

1755
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:31,723
(CHUCKLES) Congratulations, guys!

1756
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:34,142
And that's not the only piece
of good news.

1757
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:35,936
Sherrie and I are engaged!

1758
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,480
Oh. Who is Sherrie?

1759
01:28:39,064 --> 01:28:40,607
(SIGHING) She's my mom.

1760
01:28:40,691 --> 01:28:43,610
Well, if it isn't my two favorite fellas!

1761
01:28:43,694 --> 01:28:45,237
Come here. Give me some sugar.

1762
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,363
- Oh!
- (BOTH CHUCKLING)

1763
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:48,657
Ugh! So uncomfortable.

1764
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,158
Oh, come on, Scott.

1765
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:52,327
I don't want you to think of me
as your new dad.

1766
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:54,496
After all, we're fraternity brothers first.

1767
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:55,622
This is so weird.

1768
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:57,499
DON: Just think of me
as your big brother

1769
01:28:57,749 --> 01:28:59,084
that's marrying your mother.

1770
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,252
Wait. Hold on.

1771
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:03,505
We're brothers who share
the same mom slash wife.

1772
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:04,589
That's worse.

1773
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:08,260
Well, I guess we should be going now.

1774
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:12,264
Promise me you'll keep in touch.

1775
01:29:17,519 --> 01:29:20,063
You're the scariest bunch
of monsters I have ever met.

1776
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:25,944
Don't let anyone tell you different.

1777
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:41,334
(ALL CHUCKLING)

1778
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:55,015
So, what now?

1779
01:29:56,475 --> 01:29:59,102
You know, for the first time in my life,
I don't really have a plan.

1780
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:03,148
You're the great Mike Wazowski.
You'll come up with something.

1781
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:07,319
I think it's time I leave the greatness
to other monsters.

1782
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,363
I'm okay just being okay.

1783
01:30:19,498 --> 01:30:20,665
So long, Sull.

1784
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:23,168
So long.

1785
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:51,488
- Wazowski!
- (SCREAMS)

1786
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:52,989
- Whoa!
- Stop the bus!

1787
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:54,366
(BRAKES SCREECHING)

1788
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,326
Are you crazy?

1789
01:30:56,952 --> 01:30:58,453
(PANTING) Mike,

1790
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:00,872
I don't know a single Scarer
who can do what you do.

1791
01:31:01,331 --> 01:31:03,208
I know, everyone sees us together,

1792
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:05,794
they think I'm the one running the show,
but the truth is,

1793
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,713
I've been riding your coattails
since day one!

1794
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:10,799
You made the deal with Hardscrabble.

1795
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:13,510
You took a hopeless team
and made them champions.

1796
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:15,053
All I did was catch a pig!

1797
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,721
Technically, I caught the pig.

1798
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:20,016
Exactly! And you think you're just okay?

1799
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,561
You pulled off the biggest Scare
this school has ever seen!

1800
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:24,729
- That wasn't me!
- That was you!

1801
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,940
You think I could have done that
without you?

1802
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:29,401
I didn't even bring a pencil
on the first day of school.

1803
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:34,406
Mike, you're not scary. Not even a little.

1804
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:35,907
But you are fearless.

1805
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:40,620
And if Hardscrabble can't see that,
then she can just...

1806
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:42,789
I can just what?

1807
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:47,919
Careful, Mr. Sullivan.
I was just warming up to you.

1808
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:49,838
Sorry.

1809
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:51,756
Well, gentlemen,

1810
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:56,094
it seems you made the front page again.

1811
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:00,140
The two of you did something together

1812
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:02,601
that no one has ever done before.

1813
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:05,145
You surprised me.

1814
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:10,233
Perhaps I should keep an eye out
for more surprises

1815
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:11,818
like you in my program.

1816
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:15,739
But as far as the two of you
are concerned

1817
01:32:15,822 --> 01:32:17,824
there is nothing I can do for you now.

1818
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:21,911
Except, perhaps, wish you luck.

1819
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:29,794
And, Mr. Wazowski,
keep surprising people.

1820
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:43,683
You know, there is still one way
we can work at a Scare company.

1821
01:32:47,354 --> 01:32:49,397
They're always hiring in the mailroom.

1822
01:32:53,777 --> 01:32:55,570
This is better than I ever imagined!

1823
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:58,365
I bet we break the all-time record
in our first year.

1824
01:32:58,448 --> 01:32:59,866
Mike, we're mail guys.

1825
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:03,119
I know. I'm talking about
the record for letters delivered!

(GASPS)

1827
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:07,082
All right, newbies, quit goofing around.

1828
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:09,751
I'll have you know tampering
with the mail is a crime

1829
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:11,753
- punishable by banishment!
- Yes, sir.

1830
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:13,421
We're right on it, Mr. Snowman.

1831
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:15,006
The team of Wazowski and Sullivan

1832
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:17,175
are going to change the world
starting today!

1833
01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:18,259
Say scream!

1834
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:19,386
- Scream!
- Scream!

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

1836

Wazowski, good luck on your first day!

1837
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:06,433
Thanks, Merv.

1838
01:34:06,516 --> 01:34:08,518
- Good luck, Mike!
- Thanks, fellas.
