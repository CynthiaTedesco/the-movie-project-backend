00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:15,148
Leaving this to come see you.

3
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,574
And I can't wait.

4
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:38,889
Whew!

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,981
Man: Taxi! Over here.

6
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:58,743
Man: Taxi!

7
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,318
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

8
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,528
Excuse me. Excuse me.

9
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,638
- Gilpin!
- Aah!

10
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,597
You still on the toothpaste?
Are you on your phone?

11
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,398
I'm just... I'm going home for
the holidays tonight, so...

12
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,523
Does it look like tonight to you?
Because to me, it looks like today.

13
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,106
- Finish the toothpaste.
- Okay. Sorry.

14
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:51,252

00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,055
j of the year

21
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,804
Dad, we're home!

22
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,479
Dad: I'm in the kitchen!

23
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,274
Jan, Spencer!

24
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,851
In the kitchen!

25
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,564
Dad, are you on a ladder?

26
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,944
- What are you doing?
- Grandpa.

27
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,491
- What's it look like?
- Get down.

28
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,910
I'm changing your light bulb.

29
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,183
I leave you alone for 10 minutes,
you're climbing ladders?

30
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,825
- I don't think you should be doing that.
- What? Think I can't change a light bulb?

31
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,284
- Okay.
- There.

32
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,880
- No, no, no. I got it. I'm fine.
- Okay.

33
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,424
Hey, kiddo.

34
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,003
Hey, how's New York City?

35
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,842
- It's great.
- How's school?

36
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,595
It's okay. How you doing?

37
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,846
- I'm terrific. I don't even know what I'm doing here.
- You're recovering from hip surgery.

38
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,649
- Meh! I'll be out of here in no time.
- It's not a prison.

39
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,352
I want to get back to my apartment.
Is that so terrible?

40
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,563
Your apartment? Yes, it's terrible.

41
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,193
Is it really cold in here?

42
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,401
Yeah, the downstairs heater isn't working.
The guy's coming in the morning.

43
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,578
It's like a goddamn icebox.

44
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,992
Did you ever call Milo?

45
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,698
- What? No.
- Dad.

46
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,035
He's called five times. Would
you just call him back?

47
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,666
I'm not calling him back because
I don't wanna talk to him.

48
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,836
Come on, I'll help you with your bags.

49
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,545
Oh, you're staying in here.

50
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,050
We're roommates.

51
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,509
Yeah. I could just stay
downstairs on the couch.

52
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,719
What? Don't be ridiculous.
If you want, yeah.

53
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,557
It's a couple weeks. It's gonna be fine.
Come on in. Make yourself comfortable.

54
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,892
Oh! You're gonna...

55
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,151
On!

56
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,150
- You okay?
- Don't tell your mother!

57
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,533
Grandpa: This goes there.

58
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,281
There.

59
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,782
That's in there.

60
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:37,330
Grandpa: All right, let's try it.
All right, so there's that.

61
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,206
There's this. There's this.

62
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,460
The blue light, the red, the green light.

63
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,503
Oh, look at you two. How sweet is this?

64
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,885
Okay, I have to leave for work
before either of you gets up.

65
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,762
But the heater guy's coming in the morning.

66
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,933
- I think I'm gonna meet my friends for brunch at 10.
- That'll be nice. Where are you going?

67
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,604
Um...

68
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,853
- Nora's.
- What are you going there for?

69
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,310
All the restaurants in Brantford,
you gotta go to that one?

70
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,316
I didn't pick.
“What difference does it make?

71
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,022
It's been years, okay?

72
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:10,484
- I love you, honey. I'm so glad you're
home. Spencer: Love you too, mom.

73
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,709
Getting old sucks. Don't let
anybody tell you any different.

74
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,954
You still got that little girlfriend?

75
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
No.

76
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,667
We're not together anymore.

77
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,968
I don't think.

78
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:30,928
Was it her or you?

79
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,559
- It's complicated.
- Try me. We'll see if I can understand.

80
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,763
Well, when we first got together,

81
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,234
we were...

82
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,817
Sort of different people than we are now.

83
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,699
I mean, last year was...

84
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,572
Amazing.

85
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,574
I was a senior in high school.

86
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,280
I had a girlfriend.

87
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,790
Like, I finally figured out
who I was or something.

88
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,915
Mm...

89
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,331
I wish I could just feel
like that again, I guess.

90
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,513
I don't know. Long-distance
relationships are hard.

91
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,138
I mean, I know everybody says
that, but turns out it's true.

92
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,897
Can I give you a little advice?
Listen to me.

93
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:27,819
Every single day on every single subway car,
there's lots of ladies in New York City.

94
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:32,570
And one in five of them, I would
marry, no questions asked.

95
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,868
This is the best time of your life.

96
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,829
- It is?
- Yes, it is.

97
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,908
So pull it together! Because it
doesn't get any better than this.

98
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,288
It's all downhill from here.

99
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,007
Bravestone.

100
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,190
- Yay, yay, yay! Hey.
- Oh, gosh, how are you?

101
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,151
- Oh, my god, you look amazing.
- Thank you.

102
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,610
Ho, ho, ho...

103
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,411
- Fridge.
- Fridge!

104
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,909
Come here.

105
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,457
Ashley:
So we were building houses for two months,

106
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:51,546
and then on the way home, we stopped
in Costa Rica, which was also amazing.

107
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,919
That is so awesome. I am so happy for you.

108
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,125
That is so cool.

109
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,761
So, "m," that's what we're
supposed to call you now?

110
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,841
You don't have to. It's just a nickname.
One of my college friends gave me that.

111
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,268
You don't have to call me
that if you don't want to.

112
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,437
M. I love it. It's so hot.

113
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:11,483
- Okay.
- But you and Spencer, you're still not...?

114
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,107
Yeah. No. We're... we're
still, like, taking a break.

115
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,274
Where is he, by the way?

116
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,177
Oh, Christ.

117
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,597
What do you want, Milo?

118
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,424
Nice to see you too.

119
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:50,184
Yes, I'd love to come
in for a cup of coffee.

120
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,811
Thanks for asking.

121
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,105
You mind if I make some eggs?

122
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,863
Do whatever you want. I don't care.
Just hurry up. I don't have all day.

123
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,239
You going somewhere?

124
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,994
Martha: Have, um...?

125
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:13,454
Have you been in touch with Spencer much?

126
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,548
Yeah...

127
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,551
You know what?

128
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,009
Not really, actually.

129
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,588
I text him a lot, but he
doesn't always text me back.

130
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,803
I know. Fridge: It's just...

131
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:28,806
I've been crazed lately with, you
know, classes and practices,

132
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,512
and I got games on the weekends.

133
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,313
Yeah. Totally. Totally.

134
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,610
I've just... I've been... I've
been a little worried about him.

135
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:44,201
Okay, look, where...? Where is this guy?
For real.

136
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,166
Good?

137
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:50,990
Meh.

138
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,666
What do you mean, "meh"?

139
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,754
Meh!

140
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,453
What do you want already?

141
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,382
You've been calling and calling.
You show up out of the blue after 15 years.

142
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,176
Why? Because you wanna make some eggs”?

143
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,183
You remember when we first opened,

144
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,433
we had that little dishwasher, Morris?

145
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,848
Yeah, of course I remember Morris.

146
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,899
Worked the dinner shift.

147
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,819
Six days a week, 2 in the
morning most nights.

148
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,152
- The dishwasher.
- Little Morris.

149
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:27,740
Hm... he wouldn't even touch those
saucepans until he was done

150
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,039
with every single utensil in the bin.

151
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,501
Yeah... the man knew his craft.

152
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,954
Little Morris.

153
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,213
Well, get...

154
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:47,764
Just get to it, would you? I mean,
it's always the scenic route with you.

155
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,592
I know what you want,
you want to apologize.

156
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,429
And I hate to tell you, I'm not interested.

157
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,814
You think I'm supposed to apologize to you?

158
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:58,902
Oh, heater guy.

159
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,942
- Grandpa Eddie?
- Anthony?

160
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,148
Yes, sir, it's me.

161
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,983
Anthony!

162
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,284
How are you?

163
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,157
Come on in. Come on in.

164
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,788
- How you doing?
- Oh, getting old sucks.

165
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,494
- Don't ever let anybody tell you any different.
- Ha, ha.

166
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,582
Oh, this is Martha and Bethany.
This is Spencer's grandfather, Eddie.

167
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,463
Martha? You're the little girlfriend.

168
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:25,968
Uh...

169
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,761
Morning! Fridge: Morning, sir.

170
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,464
Sorry to barge in on you.

171
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,845
You're not barging. He's barging.

172
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,051
Milo Walker.

173
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,889
- Wait, Milo? Like... like Milo and Eddie's.
- Pleased to meet you.

174
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,600
Man, my dad said you guys had
the best restaurant in town.

175
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,402
We were just there. Well,
it's called Nora's now.

176
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:48,821
Nora's. It's barely even a restaurant.
It's more like a breakfast place now.

177
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:55,077
- Were you with Spencer?
- No, we came here looking for him, actually.

178
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,248
Milo: You all hungry?

179
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,372
- Eggs on the griddle.
- Might have to take a look.

180
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:03,214
- Hey, man, you can do more than take a look
at it. Fridge: All right, all right. My man.

181
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,880
Bethany: Oh!

182
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,088
- Do you need a hand?
- Do I look like I need a hand?

183
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:16,897
Bethany: Martha?

184
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,069
Hey.

185
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:24,988
Where is he?

186
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,536
Do you hear that? Yes.

187
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,997
You hear something?

188
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,334
It's probably the heater, it's broken.

189
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,972
How did it even get here?

190
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,800
I don't know.

191
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,683
Maybe he... I don't know,
maybe he went back for it or something?

192
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,066
Is he trying to fix it?

193
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,735
Why would anyone try to fix that thing?

194
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,484
I don't know.

195
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,657
I don't know. Maybe he went
to buy parts or something?

196
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,655
Okay, I'm calling him again.

197
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,783
I'm sure everything's... fine.

198
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,180
Fourteen texts and four missed calls.

199
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,014
I don't think he went out.

200
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,027
I think...

201
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,982
I think he went back in.

202
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:54,071
- No, no, no.
- What? No. Why...?

203
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,653
- Come on. Remember what it was like?
- Why would he do that?

204
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,784
- I got eaten by a fricking hippo!
- I got killed by a piece of cake!

205
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,876
Guys, guys.

206
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,284
How is he gonna get out?

207
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,787
Uh...

208
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,168
He's gotta take the... the green Jewel.

209
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,671
And stick it back in the statue thing.

210
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,921
By himself?

211
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,609
We gotta go get him.

212
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,152
Are you crazy?

213
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,446
- I'm coming with you.
- Are you out of your minds?

214
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,320
We can do this. We've been there.
We know what to expect.

215
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,849
I gotta stop hanging out with white people. I
don't know what the hell is wrong with me.

216
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:43,037
- She's right. We played before and we won.
- We barely survived!

217
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,617
You know he would do it for you.

218
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,005
For any of us.

219
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,838
Be careful. It looks pretty busted.

220
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,508
Martha: Ah! Fridge: Oh!

221
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,144
Distorted voice:
Welcome to jumaniji.

222
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,690
What...? We haven't even
picked our guys yet!

223
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,528
What?

224
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,439
Okay, okay. Here we go. Oh, I
hate this part. All right. Okay.

225
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,402
This is not happening!

226
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,085
You guys?

227
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,510
Martha: No!

228
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,930
Aah!

229
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,488
Am [I...?

230
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,155
Is it...? I can't believe...

231
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,201
Oh...

232
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,234
Ooh, oh.

233
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,408
Oh, it's her.

234
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,499
I'm her.

235
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,130
Spencer.

236
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,461
Spencer?

237
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,594
What in tarnation?

238
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,095
Where am I?

239
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,806
What the hell is this?

240
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,314
Oh, my god.

241
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,481
Eddie?

242
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,980
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Milo Walker. Who are you?

243
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,610
Milo?

244
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,408
What on earth? \what...?

245
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,780
What the... 7 - oh, my.

246
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:43,987
Wait a minute.

247
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,571
Oh, lord.

248
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,998
- This isn't happening.
- Pardon me?

249
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,202
- Who are you?
- You're Spencer's grandfather.

250
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,460
- Yeah, no kidding.
- And you are Milo.

251
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,960
I certainly am.

252
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,259
I'm Martha, Spencer's...

253
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,882
You're the little girlfriend?

254
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Look out! “What?

255
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,391
Oh, lord.

256
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:10,142
- That hurt like a goddamn...
- Bethany?

257
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,436
What? I'm not...

258
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,312
No.

259
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,863
No, no, no.

260
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,109
Yol

261
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:25,070
oh, no, no, no. This can't be happening!

262
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,164
Fridge?

263
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,745
Yes, I'm fridge, goddamn it! The hell, man?

264
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,283
Okay.

265
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,711
Okay, something went wrong.

266
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:34,798
You think?!

267
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,126
Holy...

268
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,051
Wait.

269
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,595
If I'm... then you...?

270
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,891
- Spencer?
- Why does everybody keep calling me Spencer?

271
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,717
Martha:
No, that is grandpa Eddie.

272
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,555
And that, ha... is Milo.

273
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,105
Pleased to meet you.

274
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,227
What?!

275
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,569
- Then where's Bethany? And where's Spencer?
- I don't know! Okay?

276
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,942
The game, it didn't let
us pick our avatars, so...

277
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,898
- Because it's busted!
- Yeah, okay.

278
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,324
Are we dead?

279
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,154
You know, I was just
wondering the same thing.

280
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:12,083
Did I die and turn into some kind
of a small, muscular boy scout?

281
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,165
- We're not dead.
- So then what's going on here?

282
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:21,046
Okay, this is gonna sound very strange,
but we are in a video game called Jumanji,

283
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:25,756
and we are in the bodies
of video game characters.

284
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,683
- And we've been here before, fridge and I.
- Last time, I was you.

285
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,769
Mm.

286
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,725
Huh?

287
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,303
We're in a game!

288
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,559
We gotta find Spencer
because he's in here too.

289
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,770
Spencer? Yes.

290
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,647
He's here? Yes.

291
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,353
Spencer, Eddie's grandson?

292
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,279
Yes. Spencer.

293
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,856
He's here too?

294
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,283
- Yes!
- Yes! He's here, and we gotta find him.

295
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,782
So it's like a hide-and-go-seek situation.

296
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,905
I'm not "it."

297
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:52,459
Hm...

298
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,711
My hip feels pretty good now.

299
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,792
Oh, my joints feel like butter.

300
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,720
Oh, yeah, look at those.

301
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,423
Look at these. Look at what I got.

302
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:13,599
- Uh... we have some issues here.
- You're telling me this?

303
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,395
I'm the old fat dude.

304
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:19,601
I came back, and things actually got worse.
At least last time I was still black.

305
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,151
I ook at this little fella.

306
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,362
Hello there.

307
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,694
Mr. Walker, don't get
too close to the water!

308
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,996
- Get away from there!
- I'm sorry, what'd you say?

309
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,087
Hey!

310
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,172
Gget on out of here!

311
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,715
- Oh.
- Oh...

312
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,169
- What just happened?
- What the hell was that thing?!

313
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:54,765
Well, that there was a hippopotamus.

314
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,353
Mm-hm.

315
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,271
And they are awfully fast.

316
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,101
Faster than a horse, if
you can believe that.

317
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,733
And they've got an awful ferocious bite.

318
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,189
How about that?

319
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:09,775
You know, the funny thing
is, I don't remember...

320
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,362
Knowing much about hippos until right now.

321
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,913
You're a zoologist.

322
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,742
- I'm sorry, what now?
- Are we in Florida?

323
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,002
Just listen.

324
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,580
This is a dangerous place.

325
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,960
Crazy dangerous.

326
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,134
But Martha and I, we've been here before.
We know what we're doing.

327
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:30,429
You gotta stay alert all the time.

328
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:34,509
If I'm near water, I got one
eye on the water, you hear me?

329
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,094
You got to have eyes in the back of your...

330
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,517
Oh, god.

331
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,730
What in the Sam hill just happened to him?

332
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,664
- Shut the front door.
- What the hell happened to you?!

333
00:22:58,836 --> 00:22:59,951
Damn!

334
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,042
A plane?

335
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,050
What?

336
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,844
- Come on! Follow me!
- Come on, let's go. Let's go. Follow us.

337
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,437
Welcome to Jumanji.

338
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,685
- Why is he in a plane?
- I don't know.

339
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,858
Well, don't just stand there. Hop in!

340
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,862
Nigel:
Strap in. There's no time to spare.

341
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:40,117
Dr. bravestone, famed archeologist
and international explorer,

342
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,871
I'm so glad you've returned.

343
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,044
I've been so anxious for your arrival.

344
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,205
You talking to me? Yes.

345
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,838
Once again, Jumanji is in great
peril and only you can help.

346
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,887
Nigel, we're looking for our friend.
Have you seen, like, anyone...?

347
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,181
Ruby roundhouse, killer of
men, welcome to jumanii.

348
00:23:56,727 --> 00:24:00,436
- "Killer of men"?
- Yeah, I... I kill guys.

349
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:04,561
I'm so glad you've returned.
I've been so anxious for your arrival.

350
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:08,565
- What's with this fella”?
- My dearest mouse, surely you remember me.

351
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,362
Nigel billingsly at your service.

352
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,940
Hey. Nigel, I thought that was you.

353
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,617
He's a... what is it called?

354
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,992
- Npc, a non-player character.
- He's not a real person.

355
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,745
He only has, like, a limited
number of things he can say.

356
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,497
Mm... my friend Carl is just like that.

357
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,203
Nigel, we're looking for someone.

358
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,506
- Has anyone else arrived here in Jumanji... 7?
- Jumaniji is in great peril.

359
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,255
It's all detailed in the letter
I sent you, Dr. bravestone.

360
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,927
Perhaps you should read it aloud.

361
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,556
Grandpa Eddie.

362
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,510
Do you have a letter?

363
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,762
- Do I have a letter?
- Check your pockets.

364
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,720
- Why would I have a letter?
- Because Nigel wrote you a letter.

365
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,396
I didn't get a letter from this guy.

366
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,396
- But we are in a video game, and...
- We're in a video game?

367
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,567
We're gonna die.

368
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,611
We did die. “Are we in hell?

369
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,109
- I knew it.
- Oh, my god.

370
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,691
It's all detailed in the letter
I sent you, Dr. bravestone.

371
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,198
- Perhaps you should read it aloud.
- I don't have a letter!

372
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:02,622
- How many times I gotta tell you that?
- Oh, no, Eddie. It's in your hand.

373
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,747
Where did this come from?

374
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,955
You got to pay attention
to what's in your hand.

375
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,539
Perhaps you should read it aloud.

376
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,511
Ahem...

377
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,218
"Dr. bravestone,

378
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:20,049
it is my solemn hope that this
letter finds you, for again..."

379
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,848
Nigel: Jumanji is in grave danger.
We need your help at once.

380
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,806
Eddie: Whoa, whoa! What's going on here?
Martha: It's a cutscene.

381
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,437
It's how we find out the...
I'll explain afterwards.

382
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,736
Nigel: You see, our worst
nightmare has come to pass,

383
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,940
for Jurgen the brutal has returned.

384
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:39,277
Indeed, that most vicious
jumanjian conqueror is back.

385
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,746
And he's brought with him his savage horde.

386
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,414
They descended from their
fortress atop mount zhatmire

387
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,416
and made their way south
to the avian province,

388
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,295
home of the sacred falcon Jewel,

389
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,672
worn around the neck of the village elder.

390
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,176
The falcon is the fertility
Jewel of Jumanji,

391
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:03,885
and it has been guarded by the people of
the avian province for hundreds of years.

392
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,186
So long as the Jewel can see the sun,

393
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,436
the waters will flow and
the land will flourish.

394
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,488
Aah!

395
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,985
Yeah!

396
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:32,038
Many brave souls died that day,
but Jurgen got what he came for.

397
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,464
He stowed the Jewel in darkness,

398
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,041
hidden from the sun.

399
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,809
A drought befell the land.

400
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,016
The crops dried out and died.

401
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,569
And if the Jewel is not returned
soon, it may be too late.

402
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,732
Which is why we called for you
and your brilliant associates.

403
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:03,866
I understand the enormous weight that
this must carry for you, Dr. bravestone,

404
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,992
how this adventure is like no other,

405
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,162
since it was Jurgen the brutal

406
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,244
who killed your parents.

407
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,256
No, no, no!

408
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,425
Huh?

409
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,299
He killed Dr. bravestone's parents?

410
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,722
Indeed, he did. When the
doctor was just a boy.

411
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,800
Oh, well, that's terrible.

412
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,350
I can't say this enough:

413
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,847
We're in a video game.

414
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,148
You must recover the Jewel from Jurgen
the brutal and show it to the sun.

415
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,022
He's making his way north
across the desert now.

416
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,980
Jurgen the brutal. Is that Barbara's boy?

417
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,360
And remember, the goal
is to recover the loot.

418
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,362
To wrest it from the hands of the brute.

419
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:47,446
And if you wish to leave the game, you
must save Jumanji and call out its name.

420
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,621
Excuse me.

421
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,953
Who is Jumanji?

422
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:54,502
Well, if I was listening
correctly, that is her sister.

423
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,590
Here's your map.

424
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:01,677
- Find an oasis and follow the flame to the desert fruit.
- Huh?

425
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:05,096
I can't land here, so you're
going to have to drop in. “What?

426
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,984
- No, no. Nigel...
- I'll get as low as I can.

427
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,140
Milo: Hold on. - Get ready.

428
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,179
- What do you mean?
- We don't have parachutes. Shouldn't we have...?

429
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,013
Fridge: What the hell?!
Nigel: Good luck.

430
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,144
The future of Jumanji is in your hands.

431
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:18,394
- Why did we take a plane if there's nowhere to land?
- And go!

432
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,198
Nol

433
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,302
The hell, man?!

434
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,603
Where are we?

435
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,358
Where's the jungle?

436
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,282
- What are we doing here?!
- We've got to keep it together, okay?

437
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,860
"Keep it together"? Yes.

438
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:11,493
This is a whole new thing. Nobody said
we'd have to do a whole new thing.

439
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,450
And by the way, what the
hell happened to Bethany?

440
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,176
Ugh...!

441
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,606
Milo: So, what part of new
Hampshire is this exactly?

442
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,649
Eddie:
We're not in New Hampshire, Milo.

443
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,853
That's right. Exactly. Not New Hampshire.
You're starting to get it now?

444
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,281
Nope. I don't have the foggiest
clue what's going on here.

445
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,110
That guy kept calling me Dr. braverman,
which is the name of my orthopedist.

446
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,705
What I'm thinking is, I just had another
hip surgery and now I'm coming out of it.

447
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,293
Fridge: Hey!

448
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,121
Check this out!

449
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,916
Okay.

450
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,547
We have to find Spencer.

451
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,344
In order to do that, I think we
have to start playing the game.

452
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,638
I'm sure that's what he did.

453
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:13,934
We find him, we finish
the game and we go home.

454
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,478
Ed, you okay?

455
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,184
Would you look at me?

456
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,724
I'm back.

457
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,820
- I mean, I haven't looked like this since...
- Never.

458
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,022
You looked like this never.

459
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,403
What? When I was younger,
I was in great shape.

460
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:34,705
I remember you when you were younger,
and this is not what you looked like.

461
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,873
I think my eyes are a different color.

462
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,827
All of you is a different color.

463
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,082
It's a good look on me, huh?

464
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,174
Huh?

465
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,590
Martha:
Okay. They're headed north.

466
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,963
- Which way is north?
- I have no idea.

467
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:51,718
- Well, you wanna check the map?
- Right. I'm the map guy now.

468
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:55,801
"Find an oasis and follow the
flame to the desert fruit."

469
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,728
Follow the flame to the desert fruit.

470
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,727
- You know there is nothing on that?
- He can see it, you can't.

471
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,151
Each place on the map is a different level,
and the levels get harder as we go.

472
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,279
Fridge: This one is called...

473
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,448
"Dunes."

474
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,196
No shit.

475
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,995
Eddie: Who the hell is that?

476
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,829
Oh... that's an ostrich.

477
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:24,788
Oh, no.

478
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,795
Yes, indeed.

479
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,549
That is an ostrich.

480
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,632
The ostrich is a flightless bird,

481
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,012
one of 60 species.

482
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:41,814
You got the penguin, you got
the emu and you got the kiwi.

483
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,107
Funny thing is, I don't remember knowing...

484
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,400
You're a zoologist.

485
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,899
I was a zoologist last time.
It's an important job.

486
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,230
Maybe if we could get through
this a little quicker.

487
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:55,285
Well, another thing is,
they can run up to 45 miles per hour,

488
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:59,035
which makes them the world's
fastest two-legged animal.

489
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,582
Did you know that?

490
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,125
Fascinating.

491
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,172
- What a magnificent creature.
- We should get out of here.

492
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,417
What else do you know about them?

493
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:14,881
Well, here's another interesting fact,
they have three stomachs.

494
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,135
How about that?

495
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,678
Aah... come on. Beat it!

496
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,433
Don't get so close.

497
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,857
Just a bird, okay? Come on, get moving.
Get out of here.

498
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,276
- Is there anything else we need to know?
- Beat it, bird.

499
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,695
Another interesting thing
about the ostrich...

500
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,773
I said scram, you stupid bird!

501
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,950
- Is when threatened...
- Get out of here!

502
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,116
They attack.

503
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,033
- Whoa...!
- Oh! Oh.

504
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,489
Milo: Oh, my!

505
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,659
Fddie! Eddie!

506
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,288
Where's Eddie? Is he dead?

507
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,246
Fridge: No! Yes.

508
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,002
Yes, he died, but he's fine.

509
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,881
Did I just kill Eddie...

510
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,633
By talking too slow...

511
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,928
Like he always said I would?

512
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,312
Aah!

513
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,980
Why does everybody keep
dropping from the sky?!

514
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:17,905
Nurse, I'm gonna need
to see Dr. braverman right now, please.

515
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,946
I'm not your nurse. Okay, listen.

516
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,866
These tattoos on our arms,
that is your life count.

517
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,743
We each have three lives.

518
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,329
You and fridge each have two left.

519
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,005
If you lose all three,

520
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,799
listen to me, it is game over.

521
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:38,005
- That's it. You're dead.
- Dead like... "Kaputski"?

522
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,464
Yes.

523
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,765
Kaputski.

524
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,142
What the hell is that?

525
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,815
- That's not good.
- I ook.

526
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,986
Oh! There's one more thing about ostriches.

527
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,081
Oh, no.

528
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,280
Say it!

529
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,707
They travel in herds.

530
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,330
We gotta get out of here!

531
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,132
- Dune buggies, let's go!
Eddie: Come on, come on! Shake a leg!

532
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,087
Milo: Why am I so slow?
Fridge: Haul ass, girl. Let's go!

533
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,422
- Come on, come on, come on!
- I'm coming, Eddie. Go.

534
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,848
Do you see the key anywhere?

535
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,095
- Okay, how do I do this?
- I don't know. I've never driven one of these before!

536
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,481
Maybe under the dash.

537
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,600
(Green button!

538
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:33,731
Green button. Go.

539
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,107
Go, go, go!

540
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:38,534
Go, go.

541
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,034
Oh, my god!

542
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,058
Milo: Go.

543
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,926
You are a terrible driver.

544
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,104
- What are you talking about? We're fine.
- Nobody fine. You...

545
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,851
Whoa! Whoa!

546
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,559
Oh, no. Aah! Aah!

547
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,984
Oh, help!

548
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,987
Hold on, Eddie. Please don't let go.

549
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,189
Aah!

550
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,150
Oh, wow. Oh, help.

551
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,828
Aah!

552
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,283
Help. Eddie.

553
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,133
Beat it!

554
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,458
Gget out of here!

555
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,807
I think we lost them.

556
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,885
Yeah? Yeah.

557
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,846
- Oh!
- Aah!

558
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:54,902
Whoa! - Aah!

559
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,774
Martha: Are you okay? Yeah.

560
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,568
Oh, god.

561
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:06,907
Fridge: Oh, no.

562
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,331
- What do we do?
- I don't know!

563
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,549
Get in! Hurry!

564
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,062
Ha! Suckers!

565
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,480
- Eddie...
- Uh-oh.

566
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,374
Milo: Oh, dear.

567
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,544
Martha: What do we do?

568
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,914
What do we do?!

569
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,507
What are you doing?

570
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,927
- Birds, birds, birds!
- Birds!

571
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,430
- What the hell, man?!
- They're flightless birds.

572
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,811
This is a flightless dune buggy!

573
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,988
Milo: No, no, no!

574
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,949
Milo: We're not gonna make it.
- We're gonna make it.

575
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,111
Martha: No, we're not!

576
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,565
- I don't think we're gonna make fit.
- We're gonna make it.

577
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,336
We're not gonna make it.

578
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,721
That was fantastic.

579
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,853
Milo: Horrible driver.

580
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,853
Yeah, you see that, birds?

581
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,026
You don't mess with the kid. Right there!

582
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,117
Eddie: Did you see me?

583
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,109
I was incredible.

584
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,028
I mean, I saved you, I saved you,

585
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:16,583
I saved this guy from a bird
while I was driving a car.

586
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,035
I was a machine. I was relentless.

587
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,915
- I was fearless.
- Yes. Exactly. Fearless.

588
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,172
That's bravestone. Okay, check this out.

589
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,720
Oh, goodness.

590
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,884
- What the hell?
- It's your strengths and weaknesses.

591
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:38,642
I... I mean your avatar,
Dr. bravestone's strengths and weaknesses.

592
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,519
"Fearless," check.

593
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,067
"Speed. Climbing. Boomerang"?

594
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,020
"Smoldering intensity"?

595
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,322
- It's this stupid face you make.
- Huh?

596
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,615
There it is.

597
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,791
Ew, ew, old man. Get it together.

598
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,368
Eddie, you okay? You having a heart attack?

599
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,792
His whole left side is shutting down.
Eddie, look at me!

600
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,499
- Yeah?
- There you go. Now you're back.

601
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,053
"Weakness: Switchblade."

602
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,505
Switchblade? Hey, that's new.

603
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:16,002
- Bravestone didn't have any weaknesses last time.
- Yeah, bugged the hell out of me.

604
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:17,678
I wonder if...

605
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,608
"Nunchucks"?

606
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,526
That's new.

607
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,901
- Damn, that's a good list.
- Milo, push on your left, like, chest area.

608
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,862
- I'm sorry, what?
- Come on, man.

609
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,160
Hey!

610
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,363
Oh, I got one too. What...?

611
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,823
My. "Zoology."

612
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:43,962
- That's what you were talking about earlier.
- Yes. Exactly. Your avatar is a zoologist.

613
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:49,133
You know, my nephew Maxwell is a
veterinarian. What a fascinating...

614
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,506
Martha: "Linguistics"?
- I didn't have that last time.

615
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,930
- The study of languages.
Eddie: Makes sense.

616
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:57,180
He studies the entire language
on his way to the point.

617
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,433
Anyway, he's 32. Or is he 35?

618
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,435
- Time does fly.
- Okay, let's get it over with.

619
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,445
You gotta be kidding me.

620
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,898
Well, geometry is...

621
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,449
Is new. Yeah.

622
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,652
Who wouldn't want to be better at geometry?

623
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,033
And for weaknesses, "endurance."

624
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:22,037
And what else? Let's see,
"heat, sun and sand.”

625
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,003
Shouldn't be a problem.

626
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,924
It's not like we're in the middle
of a goddamn desert or anything.

627
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,627
What's the point of this guy?
Who even needs this guy?

628
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:36,010
- He can read the map.
- Easy for you to say, you got nunchucks!

629
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:39,343
I've been training four
hours a day for six months.

630
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,223
Now look at me!

631
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,851
Man, it is hot out here!

632
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:47,685
How is this guy a character
in an adventure game?

633
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,482
Okay, okay, okay.

634
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,485
I just gotta get this guy in shape
and build up some endurance.

635
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,736
I know how to do that.

636
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,442
Burpees. Five burpees, right now.

637
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,777
Get it going!

638
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,494
- That's one.
- One!

639
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,920
- Oh, no.
Fridge: Oh, yeah, come on!

640
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,511
North is that way!

641
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:29,768
Milo: You know, it's, uh...

642
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,275
- It's really good to see you, ed.
- I don't wanna hear it.

643
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,823
You don't wanna hear that
it's good to see you?

644
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,528
- You sold me out, Milo.
- I did not sell you out.

645
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,738
We sold our business. It was time.

646
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,199
- Yeah, time for who?
- Well, it was time for me.

647
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:49,163
Okay? Standing on my feet, serving a
hundred plates a night for 35 years?

648
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,463
I was done.

649
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,082
I was ready, man.

650
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,917
I was ready to retire.

651
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,298
I'm done talking!

652
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,898
Fridge: "The oasis."

653
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,194
I guess that's the next level.

654
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,777
Huh?

655
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,155
The next level of the game.

656
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,660
We're in a game?

657
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,994
Yes, grandpa Eddie, we are in a game.
You can't be serious.

658
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,498
Did you know about this?

659
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,501
I thought you were done talking.

660
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,427
- Bethany?
- Yep.

661
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,269
- My name's Bethany too.
- Really?

662
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,395
- Daddy, her name's Bethany too.
- Hm?

663
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,781
Sure is, sweetie.

664
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,692
Can I talk to you for a minute?

665
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,618
Sure, yeah. Uh, come in.

666
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:10,376
I'm sorry, I just... I didn't
know where else to go.

667
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,249
No, no, no, it's okay.

668
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,955
I'm glad you came.

669
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:17,292
Do you think you can help me
get the machine to start?

670
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,263
That is so dangerous.

671
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,350
I know.

672
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,846
But I have to try.

673
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,273
They're my team.

674
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,245
Milo:
So, what exactly are we looking for again?

675
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,243
Eddie:
We're looking for my grandson, genius.

676
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,326
Okay, "follow the flame
to the desert fruit."

677
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,549
I ook.

678
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,674
They're here.

679
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,376
Hyenas.

680
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,178
Unusual for their bone-crushing teeth.

681
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,061
Fridge: Smoke stack.

682
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,769
Where there's smoke...

683
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:11,937
There's fire.

684
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,182
- Come on.
- Mm.

685
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,526
Man 1: You call that a roll?

686
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,400
Man 2: Not bad at all.
Man 3: I'll bet you two more, fellas!

687
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,652
Man 4: Drinks! Drinks over here!

688
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,321
Man 5: Another round here!

689
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,368
Yeah! Yeah!

690
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:46,260
J the world was on fire
and no one could save me but you ij

691
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,090
I thought you'd never come back.

692
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,553
I need to talk to you.

693
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,266
Absolutely.

694
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,898
Not here, not now.

695
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,354
Not around them.

696
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,070
- Oh!
- Leave me alone!

697
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:14,951
Wow.

698
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,787
Fiery.

699
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,838
Fridge: Not a real person.

700
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:20,926
What'd she say?

701
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,380
She said she thought I was
never gonna come back here,

702
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,429
she wants to get together later,
and we all know what that means.

703
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:27,800
Hi-yo.

704
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,883
It means that she's got a clue for you.

705
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,343
Oh, that's a coincidence
because I got a clue for her.

706
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,166
- You got a clue for her.
Martha: Wait a minute.

707
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,148
She's your ex-girlfriend. She's the flame.

708
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,021
"Follow the flame." “What?

709
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,325
The Jewel, it's here.

710
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,382
Walt, is that the guy
that killed my parents?

711
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,933
No. Well, yeah. Kind of.

712
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,767
We lost a good man today.

713
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,600
The very best of us.

714
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,479
For dagfinn...

715
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,734
Wasn't just my hyena master.

716
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,734
He was my friend.

717
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,694
I loved him like a brother.

718
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,831
And now he's gone.

719
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,292
And his beloved hyenas are left

720
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,041
without their master.

721
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,587
Long live dagfinn.

722
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:49,591
All: Long live dagfinn!

723
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,923
Why did he have to die?

724
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,719
He died because...

725
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,350
He made a mistake.

726
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:02,358
He tried to steal something
quite precious from me.

727
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,353
He left me no choice.

728
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,359
And now...

729
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:12,903
I feed him to his beloved hyenas.

730
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,494
That's messed up.

731
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,497
I loved dagfinn!

732
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,455
There's none among you I love as much.

733
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:26,801
And so...

734
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:33,388
The key!

735
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:35,935
It's gone.

736
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:38,887
Thief!

737
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,768
I got her. I got the thief.

738
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,441
Wait.

739
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,439
- Are you guys...?
- Come here.

740
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,105
Man 1: Catch her!
Man 2: Don't let her get away.

741
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,319
Trying to steal the key to my chest?

742
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,947
Nope.

743
00:47:58,501 --> 00:47:59,616
Shake her down.

744
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,294
I'm sorry, I did it. It was my fault.

745
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,417
L, uh...

746
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:08,343
I just...

747
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,959
I don't...

748
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:13,046
I don't know what I was... oy vey.

749
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,258
Wow. It's like, um... it's
like I'm hyperventilating.

750
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,011
Does anyone have, like,
a eucalyptus inhaler?

751
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,846
Or a brown paper bag?

752
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:22,941
Spencer?

753
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,395
Is it really hot in here?
You mean...?

754
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,482
That's him. Right there. “What?

755
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,865
That ain't Spencer.
I know my grandson. My grandson's a guy.

756
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:35,951
Did he change his hair?

757
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,030
- Cut off her head.
- Yegh!

758
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,865
- Cut off her head!
- Wait, wait, wait.

759
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,076
I just think maybe don't cut off my head?

760
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:45,999
- Spencer!
- Oh, my.

761
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,796
- Did he just...?
- Oh, lord.

762
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,295
That's my life alert.

763
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,877
I gotta take my pill.

764
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:00,725
Martha: Come on!

765
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:03,850
Spencer!

766
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,727
Oh, my god, you're alive.

767
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,683
What are you guys doing here?

768
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,565
What are we doing here?
We came to get you, fool!

769
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,521
- Bethany?
- Not Bethany. Fridge, goddamn it!

770
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,784
What? So, um...

771
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,910
Milo Walker, darling.

772
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:20,874
Milo?

773
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,160
- Spencer? Is that you, kiddo?
- Grandpa?

774
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:30,373
Guys, I found Spencer.
Here's Spencer. What are you stealing for?

775
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:32,712
I'm still me.

776
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,885
Oh. Hey.

777
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,133
= ieee ===

778
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,223
Come on.

779
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,485
Let's go.

780
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:01,704
Damn it, I was so close. I
had the key in my hand.

781
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,121
- Why'd you stop me?
- Huh?

782
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:05,529
Someone yelled "thief," so I grabbed you.
What do you want?

783
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,786
You guys shouldn't have come here.
I had it under control.

784
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,837
Did you? It looked like
you just got murdered.

785
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,632
I mean, what the hell, Spencer?
Why are you even here?

786
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,039
Martha:
Why did you have the game?

787
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:18,178
We destroyed it so that
this would never happen!

788
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,552
I went back and got it, okay?

789
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:23,885
I don't know why I did it, but I did.

790
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,844
And then last night...

791
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,349
I've been in kind of a weird place,
and something came over me, okay?

792
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,685
And now we're all stuck here again!

793
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,816
I thought that I would be him.

794
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,529
Bravestone!

795
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,737
I wanted to feel like that again.

796
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,580
Like... I could do anything.

797
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,242
But instead, I'm, um...

798
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,003
Ming fleetfoot.

799
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,132
Martha:
"Cat burglar, pickpocket, safecracker."

800
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,918
Another better character.

801
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,299
Martha: "Weakness: Pollen.”
yeah.

802
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:04,509
She's small and crafty, and has allergies.
I mean, she's basically me.

803
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,387
I swear, man, if we survive,
I am gonna kill you.

804
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,183
I just can't believe you
came back here on purpose.

805
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:14,234
I'm sorry. Okay?

806
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,448
I'm sorry.

807
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:20,525
Wait!

808
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,075
Eddie: Oh, there she is.

809
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,743
- Who?
- My ex.

810
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:25,665
Okay.

811
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,458
Hi.

812
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:31,828
If my husband knew I was talking to you,

813
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,083
you'd be dead by morning.

814
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,790
Uh... don't tell him?

815
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:41,254
Listen to me, Jurgen and his army
are returning to his fortress.

816
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,590
There, they will meet the brothers kababik.

817
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:48,177
He will trade the falcon Jewel,
and an alliance will be formed.

818
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:51,810
You must get the Jewel before that happens.

819
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,390
You're our only hope,

820
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,567
so you must hurry.

821
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:58,821
Oh, my.

822
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,234
- Now you must go.
- Gotta go.

823
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,287
- Walit, they're gonna meet the brothers who?
- The brothers kababik.

824
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,364
- The brothers bababik.
- Shh.

825
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:12,202
- Kababik?
- You must get the Jewel before that happens.

826
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:15,754
You are our only hope, so you must hurry.

827
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,924
- I think you should explain it to us one more time.
- Wait a second.

828
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,553
What about the desert fruit?
Aren't you gonna lead us to that?

829
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,104
Now I must go...

830
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,857
Before switchblade realizes I'm gone.

831
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,528
What?

832
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:39,729
- Switchblade?
- That's his weakness.

833
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,737
I love you, Dr. bravestone.

834
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,073
And I always will.

835
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,164
That...

836
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,539
Is my curse.

837
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,123
I love you too!

838
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,331
Well, she seems like a nice girl.

839
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,755
We need camels.

840
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:10,267
Okay, if we're gonna catch up
with Jurgen, we need camels.

841
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:13,596
And we need to find the desert
fruit, whatever that is.

842
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,182
"Follow the flame." I mean, I
guess we have to follow her.

843
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,858
You guys follow her, we'll
go steal some camels.

844
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:39,674
Whoa.

845
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,324
"Jumanji Berry tree."

846
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,323
Jumanji Berry?

847
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,745
That's a desert fruit?

848
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:13,958
I guess.

849
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:18,332
"In the moment of need, remember the seed.”

850
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,250
A little bit of Jumanji wisdom there.

851
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:27,847
Martha: There it is.

852
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,094
Okay, Milo and I will break
in and get the camels.

853
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:37,931
Grandpa, you stay here on lookout,
all right? Keep a low profile.

854
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,357
Got it? Low profile.

855
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:44,983
If anyone tries to enter the livery,
just, I don't know, whistle or something.

856
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,438
Sure thing.

857
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,202
That's not when you smolder.

858
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,154
It's not the moment for it.

859
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,456
- Forget it.
- I just did it. I don't know what it was.

860
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,750
Look like your stomach is upset.

861
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,543
Like you ate something bad.

862
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,506
Oh, man.

863
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:05,958
I'm sweating.

864
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,133
I'm sweating.

865
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:12,090
Stealing makes me very uncomfortable,
which is not ideal for a burglar.

866
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,867
So the fruit is in the tree.

867
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:41,294
But you can't get to it without going
through the water or whatever that is.

868
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,250
Get boiled or eaten by
piranhas or something.

869
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,509
"Follow the flame."

870
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,588
I think that's how we get there.

871
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,513
But I don't know how I'm
supposed to make that jump.

872
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,218
I mean, it's doable...

873
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,600
But I don't have my usual explosiveness.

874
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,770
Whoa! Yo!

875
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,819
Ha, ha. Wow!

876
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,748
Yes!

877
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,044
Martha!

878
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,710
Martha!

879
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,055
- Martha!
- Oh, it's really heavy.

880
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,135
You okay? Give me your hand.

881
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,230
There you go.

882
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,494
Wait a second.

883
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,702
- What...?
- The hell, man?

884
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,280
Oh, my god!

885
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,206
- The hell, man?!
- Oh, my god.

886
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,373
Fridge? Yeah.

887
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,132
Martha?

888
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,051
Yeah.

889
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,549
Hey, move along. Nothing to see here.

890
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:20,843
What'd you say?

891
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,896
I said, keep walking, pal.
Nothing to see here. Beat it.

892
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,813
- What'd you say?
- I said, beat it, get out of here.

893
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:30,853
What'd you say?

894
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:42,952
I said, scram!

895
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,124
You want a piece of me?

896
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,167
Yeah, come on, come on.

897
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:57,179
What do you got? What do you got? Come on!

898
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,803
Come and get it. Yeah!

899
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:06,263
Come on, you bastards!

900
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:10,108
Man: Aah! Eddie: Wow! Ha, ha.

901
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,772
Here, camel, camel.

902
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,566
Come on, let's go.

903
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:19,326
They are proud and majestic
animals, aren't they?

904
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,366
Oh. You're welcome.

905
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:30,708
Did you...? Were you just talking to them?

906
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,712
Um, press your menu. Uh, it's right here.

907
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:38,674
"Linguistics."

908
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,471
You can talk to animals.

909
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,594
Yes.

910
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,142
It appears that I speak camel.

911
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,892
- Can you ask them to, like, come with us and be...?
- Excuse me.

912
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,104
They're willing to talk.

913
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,562
They wanna know what's in it for them
and how much luggage we have.

914
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,611
Martha: Will you look at me?

915
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:02,532
I mean, what am I supposed to do with this?

916
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,158
You read the map.

917
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,581
I don't wanna read the map.
I'm supposed to be her.

918
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,660
Instead, there's actual hair
growing out of my face!

919
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:13,088
Sorry. All bodies are
beautiful, even this one.

920
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,217
Wait a second.

921
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,016
Whoa!

922
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,970
- This is amazing!
- Careful.

923
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,228
Fridge...

924
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:32,183
Yo, this thing is insane!

925
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:35,735
- Be careful. That body is not a toy.
- No, it's a machine.

926
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,982
And on top of that...

927
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,360
Boobs.

928
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,942
Touch my boobs and I will murder you.

929
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:43,902
Too late. It was the first thing I did.

930
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:45,498
Fw.

931
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,366
Hey, hey, don't do that.

932
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:53,829
- Let's take this Jumanji Berry and go meet them.
- Relax, girl.

933
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,085
I'm trying that flying
acrobat thing you did.

934
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:58,918
- Don't. We have the Berry. It's not necessary.
- Check this out.

935
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,173
Omaha, Omaha! Hut, hut, hike!
Wait.

936
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:06,679
Fridge, be careful! I am telling
you, that body's a weapon.

937
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,352
- You don't even know what it's capable of.
- This is amazing!

938
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:13,648
- That body's a loaded gun!
- Yeah! And this gun's about to go off!

939
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,188
Whoo... aah!

940
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,394
Oh, my god!

941
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,191
Fridge!

942
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:20,950
Come here.

943
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:24,201
- Oh, my god.
- Goddamn it!

944
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,027
Here, I got you. I got ya.

945
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:41,043
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no!

946
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,254
Oh, my god, that was awful.

947
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,304
I hate being the map guy!

948
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,968
Let's get out of here.

949
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:56,934
Man: Switchblade!

950
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,028
There he is.

951
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,524
Switchblade: Bravestone!

952
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,231
I told you to stay the
hell away from my wife!

953
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:10,038
- We got company.
- What did you do?

954
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,200
All right, guys, this is the moment.
We need you now.

955
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,332
Uh, they said that we can
get away out the back door.

956
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,463
Are you talking to that camel?

957
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:23,794
Yes.

958
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,675
That's Lucille and Hank.

959
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,380
And Jeffrey's in the back.

960
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,606
Fridge: Hey! Martha: Hey.

961
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:41,107
- We should get going.
- What happened?

962
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:45,119
My grandpa beat up 45 strangers for no reason, and
now that woman's husband is trying to kill him.

963
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,076
Is that the desert fruit?

964
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:51,747
Yeah. It's a Jumanji Berry, and
it weighs like 100 pounds.

965
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,285
My grandpa will carry it.

966
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,358
- We should get out of here. Come
on, grandpa. Martha: Let's go.

967
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:01,631
- I could take them.
Martha: What?

968
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,447
- What are you talking about? We escaped.
- I said, I could take them.

969
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:07,508
- Oh, Eddie.
- No, grandpa Eddie, that's switchblade!

970
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,681
I'm telling you, there's
a time when you run,

971
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:13,056
then there's a time in life, like
right now, where you stay...

972
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,187
Yeah!

973
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,859
- Yeah!
All: Switchblade! Switchblade!

974
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:23,778
Nice shot, switchblade!

975
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,840
What?

976
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,596
We should see mount zhatmire pretty soon.

977
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:03,811
You know, Gladys and I took a
road trip before she passed.

978
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,271
We went on a ceramics tour

979
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:07,902
through the southwest.

980
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:11,611
I lost my restaurant so you could
drive around and look at ashtrays?

981
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:14,663
Yes, ed.
That's what you do when you retire.

982
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,161
You explore your interests.

983
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,416
I don't have interests.

984
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:22,211
Guys like me, we don't retire!

985
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:26,167
We work, and then we keep working,
and then, eventually, we die.

986
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:27,546
But you retired me.

987
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,173
You retired me.

988
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:32,677
It's a wonder I lasted as long as I did.
“What?

989
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:36,680
- You're a difficult man, ed.
- You don't abandon your best friend, Milo.

990
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,228
When I lost the restaurant,
I lost everything!

991
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:40,733
You...?

992
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,979
Yes. Yes, I know he is.

993
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:47,233
- What? Are you talking to my camel?
- Yes, I'm talking to the camel.

994
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,484
And he can tell

995
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,816
that you're a pain in the ass.

996
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,276
My camel's taking your side?

997
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,830
And he's not your camel.

998
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,872
He's just giving you a ride.

999
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,999
Oh. Well, how about the both of you
go screw yourselves?

1000
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,205
- What did you just say?
- Guys!

1001
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,633
You and me, we gonna settle
this right here, right now!

1002
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,886
- I'll show you.
- What are you doing?

1003
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,493
- Don't worry about where I'm going.
- Milo, what are you doing?

1004
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,680
Hold on. Wait, wait. Here we go.

1005
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:25,308
You want a piece of me, huh?
That's what you want?

1006
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,985
You do not want a piece of
him, Milo, I'm telling you.

1007
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:30,485
Oh, that's where you're wrong, young man.

1008
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,657
Because I do want a piece.

1009
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,234
I want a big piece.

1010
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:40,040
See, Eddie, what you don't know
is that for the last 15 years,

1011
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,492
I've been studying tai chi.

1012
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,001
And right now,

1013
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:46,375
I am harnessing my chi.

1014
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:49,583
And when I'm done, I'm gonna whup your ass.

1015
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:52,714
Milo, I am telling you,
this is not a good idea.

1016
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,136
Nol

1017
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:00,434
on!

1018
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,309
Milo: Ahh!

1019
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,732
On!

1020
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:06,979
Dude!

1021
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,277
You gotta stop killing everybody.

1022
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,903
All right, then.

1023
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,579
I guess that's settled.

1024
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,136
The camels just stopped.

1025
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,600
This is as far as they go.

1026
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:43,724
To get to Jurgen's fortress,

1027
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:47,148
they said that we can head down
this path here and make a right.

1028
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,771
Then we're in his territory.

1029
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:51,899
And they don't wanna go there
because they don't want to die.

1030
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,486
We don't wanna die either.

1031
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,906
The worst bravestone of all time.

1032
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:40,326
So we have to get across... this.

1033
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,617
Okay, we can do this. We can do this.

1034
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,123
We just have to take our time
and make careful decisions.

1035
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:50,920
What are you talking about? It's obvious.

1036
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:54,917
We start on that bridge right there, then jump
to that one that heads to right at 30 degrees,

1037
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:58,674
and then those two that look
like two sides of a trapezoid...

1038
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,255
Geometry.

1039
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,760
That's what it's for!

1040
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,676
Maybe this character's
not totally worthless.

1041
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,811
- I'll go first.
- Really?

1042
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,602
You see? It's no big deal.

1043
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,818
- What's going on?
- No, no, no.

1044
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:19,910
Oh, no.

1045
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:23,737
- No.
- Grandpa!

1046
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:28,833
Oh, crap.

1047
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,369
Aw, geez.

1048
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,172
What the hell?

1049
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:39,968
Spencer: It's okay. We can do this.
Martha: Yeah?

1050
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,796
It's just about finding the right timing.

1051
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,677
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Follow me.

1052
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:49,815
Come on!

1053
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:52,432
Eddie: Come on, Milo, come on!

1054
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,940
- Oh... oh, lord.
- Here.

1055
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:01,702
Okay.

1056
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,493
Hey, you guys.

1057
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,667
Is that rock moving?

1058
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:18,216
Oh, no. “What?

1059
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,544
Well, now, this is a problem.

1060
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,136
Come on, what is it?

1061
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,325
Milo: Oh, my. Spencer: What?

1062
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,010
Eddie: Spit it out!
Fridge: What is it?

1063
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,342
Martha: Just tell us!
Spencer: Tell us! Milo!

1064
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,231
Those are mandrills.

1065
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,526
- We should go. Go, go!
- Go!

1066
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,691
That one! Obtuse angle!

1067
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:48,947
Note the distinctive and colorful pigment
around their face and buttocks.

1068
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,377
Mandrills are the heaviest of all monkeys.

1069
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:59,583
Even heavier than baboons,
with which they are often confused.

1070
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:04,344
Fridge:
And now head for the rhombus!

1071
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:05,922
Come on. Hurry up.

1072
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,802
- Rhombus! Rhombus!
- Come on.

1073
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,651
No, Martha!

1074
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:20,774
Not that one! You're on the wrong bridge!
“What?

1075
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,355
The perpendicular one!

1076
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:30,697
Martha!

1077
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:38,166
Martha!

1078
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:42,667
Nol

1079
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,591
nol

1080
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,971
Spencer, behind you!

1081
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:51,770
Jump!

1082
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:53,978
Come on, I got you!

1083
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,442
Spencer!

1084
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:07,776
Oh, no! No! No!

1085
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,165
Oh, no! No!

1086
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:21,505
(Get off!

1087
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,259
Come on.

1088
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:36,767
All right, bring it on.

1089
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,391
Come on, come here.

1090
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:44,865
Grandpa!

1091
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,532
Grandpa! Enough!

1092
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,074
Grandpa, stop! Yeah!

1093
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:50,322
They're gone!

1094
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,533
Whoa!

1095
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:02,632
Martha: Come on!

1096
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,096
Give me your hand!

1097
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,639
- What?!
- Trust me!

1098
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,414
(30.

1099
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,454
Last one. Aim for the
center of the parabola!

1100
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,545
Oh, damn.

1101
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:44,633
Son of a...

1102
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:55,182
- Eddie?
- Milo!

1103
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:56,725
Eddie!

1104
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,144
Hey, Eddie, where you going?

1105
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:00,893
I need your help, Eddie.

1106
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:04,027
Eddie!

1107
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:11,483
On.

1108
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:19,290
Eddie! Milo!

1109
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,006
On!

1110
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,722
- Seriously?
- L_ater.

1111
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:45,068
- Run!
- Run!

1112
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:20,722
Hey, guys.

1113
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:26,725
Martha: Alex, what are you doing here?
- Bethany thought you might need some help.

1114
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,852
- Where is Bethany?
- She's right here.

1115
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,025
You mean...?

1116
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:39,620
"Oh, my god, right?

1117
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:41,914
Like, I'm a total horse.

1118
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:45,035
I can't believe that we found you guys.

1119
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,747
- Hi."
- Yep, that's Bethany.

1120
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:51,917
- What's up, girl?
- Hey.

1121
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:55,299
Oh, we brought you some clothes.
You must be freezing.

1122
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:04,183
So, uh, this horse is a
character in the game?

1123
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,103
Yeah.

1124
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:06,397
Cyclone's his name.

1125
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,645
- How's that feel?
- I don't know. I sprained it pretty good.

1126
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,854
Where'd you get these clothes?

1127
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:17,113
When I realized how far north we were
going, we stopped to go shopping.

1128
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:18,783
Spencer: You can shop here?

1129
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:22,329
- How did you know how to do that?
- I was here for 20 years, kiddo.

1130
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,407
At least I got rid of that stupid hat.

1131
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:25,912
Now I got this stupid hat.

1132
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,010
Milo: It's something, isn't it?

1133
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,016
Yeah, it's something.

1134
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:51,229
You know, Eddie,

1135
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:55,404
you didn't lose everything
when you lost the restaurant.

1136
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:58,945
You still got a lot, man.

1137
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:05,122
I lost my friend.

1138
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,455
So did I.

1139
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:24,887
I'm sorry, Milo.

1140
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:33,900
Hey, I'm sorry too, Eddie.

1141
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:37,529
I should have tracked you
down a long time ago.

1142
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,735
I'm glad you came over for coffee.

1143
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,406
What made you do it, huh?

1144
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:50,295
I mean, why now?

1145
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,381
Milo, what's going on?

1146
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,550
You're sick.

1147
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:07,889
How bad?

1148
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,730
I don't have much time left.

1149
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:17,103
Son of a bitch.

1150
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,109
But I count myself lucky, Eddie.

1151
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,991
I was married to a wonderful woman.

1152
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:25,236
I got to live a wonderful life.

1153
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:28,243
And not everybody can say that.

1154
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,791
That's why I wanted to make
things better with you.

1155
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:33,289
And now that they are...

1156
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:35,503
Well, I'm...

1157
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,211
I'm happy about that too.

1158
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:53,806
Grandpa, Milo.

1159
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:55,766
Come on, we gotta go.

1160
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,237
Fridge: "The fortress."

1161
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,485
I cooks like the last level.

1162
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,414
Okay, so we, uh, climb that mountain
and then we sneak in somehow.

1163
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:13,914
Yeah, and then we steal the Jewel
before the brothers kababik get there.

1164
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:16,746
- And then show it to the sun?
- Sounds like a plan.

1165
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:17,841
What?!

1166
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:21,918
I'm sorry, I think I missed
the "plan" part of the plan.

1167
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:25,345
That last level almost killed us all.
I can barely walk.

1168
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:27,514
Your grandpa beats the
hell out of the wrong guy,

1169
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:30,638
or we get attacked by a polar bear,
what am I supposed to do?

1170
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:32,265
I'm not gonna beat up the wrong guy.

1171
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:35,348
You are gonna beat up the wrong guy!
You're not a good bravestone!

1172
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:39,064
You're too stubborn and pissed off,
and you keep getting us killed.

1173
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,736
What the hell you talking about?

1174
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,404
And Milo...

1175
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,482
And I say this with all due respect, sir.

1176
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:46,909
Is not a good person to be the zoologist.

1177
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:50,871
He talks too slow, and by the time
he gets to the point, you're dead!

1178
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:52,323
Once again, no offense.

1179
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:53,328
None taken.

1180
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:55,034
And let me tell you why.

1181
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:57,336
Because my friend Bernard...
You see?

1182
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:01,920
You're a thief who's too neurotic to
steal anything, Bethany's a horse...

1183
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,928
All I know is, we are stuck here again,

1184
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:10,133
we are running out of lives and
my ankle is killing me! Aah!

1185
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:12,138
- Oh, my god!
- Fridge!

1186
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:14,561
Fridge! Are you okay?

1187
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:18,311
Fridge:
Yo, you guys gotta see this!

1188
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:33,037
That's what the water
looked like at the tree.

1189
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:35,749
When we...

1190
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:37,827
Switched bodies.
Switched bodies.

1191
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:10,572
J welcome to the jungle
we've got fun and games j

1192
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:13,530
js we got everything you want
honey, we know the names j

1193
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:17,663
j we are the people that can find
whatever you may need j.

1194
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,203
Goddamn, that is cold!

1195
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:25,754
Oh! Oh, man! It's freezing!

1196
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:27,050
What the hell, man?

1197
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:30,341
Yes!

1198
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:31,717
I missed you so much.

1199
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,720
Oh, my god, you guys, hi.

1200
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,635
Ahem. Spencer?

1201
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,561
- Grandpa?
- Yeah, what?

1202
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:49,617
Milo?

1203
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:53,906
You should see the size of your...

1204
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:57,163
Damn.

1205
01:19:57,251 --> 01:20:00,368
- I never thought I'd be this happy to shrink.
- Ha, ha.

1206
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,919
I have never seen anything
quite like that before.

1207
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:06,716
Oh, my god, it's so good to be
able to talk again with words.

1208
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,918
Spencer, hi!

1209
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:11,174
- Hey, Bethany.
- We have so much catching up to do.

1210
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:12,675
I wanna hear about New York.

1211
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,553
But it feels like maybe this
isn't the perfect, like, moment.

1212
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,930
Right. Like, later.

1213
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:19,022
I ater.

1214
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:21,816
Better?

1215
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:23,641
Yeah.

1216
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:24,736
Much.

1217
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:31,615
I got hair! Ha, ha.

1218
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:34,535
For the first time in 40 years.
I gotta go tell Milo.

1219
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:36,703
Be careful out there, grandpa.
Yeah.

1220
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:38,246
- How's your ankle?
- Hmm?

1221
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,164
Your ankle.

1222
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:42,288
It's a little sore, but definitely not
as bad as you were making it seem.

1223
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,190
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

1224
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:47,047
You were making a really big deal
of it and it's not that bad.

1225
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,718
- Hey! Get the hell away from that horse!
- Freezel

1226
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:58,183
Eddie: Milo! Hey!

1227
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,806
Bethany:
Wait, which ankle was it?

1228
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,103
- Hold it.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1229
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,726
Get your hands off of me.

1230
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:05,023
Hey! I'm with you, Milo.

1231
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,190
I'm right here.

1232
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,776
Guys, guys.

1233
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,321
Eddie and Milo.

1234
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:15,411
They got them.

1235
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,410
Fridge: There's ice everywhere,

1236
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:26,621
and there's only one road in.

1237
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,435
It's covered with guards though.
I don't know how we'll get in there.

1238
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:31,501
Bethany: Hmm.

1239
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:33,586
Whoa. Oh, okay.

1240
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,797
I see a dungeon at the
top of this ice wall.

1241
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,008
That must be where they're
keeping your grandpa.

1242
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:43,722
And Milo is probably in this, like, barn thing
all the way on the other side of the place.

1243
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:45,977
Okay. We gotta split up.

1244
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:48,684
One team goes to get Milo,
the other team busts out my grandpa.

1245
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:50,735
But how do we get in?

1246
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:53,906
Fridge, do you have any ice-climbing
equipment in your backpack?

1247
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:58,194
You mean something like this?

1248
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,617
- Just like that.
- See?

1249
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:03,824
That's why I'm the backpack guy.

1250
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:05,784
- That's why.
- Yeah. You're great at that.

1251
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,039
Yeah, I know.

1252
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,293
Martha, will you come with me?

1253
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:11,801
Of course.

1254
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:23,969
I forgot what this part feels like.

1255
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:26,149
It's scary.

1256
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:29,858
Yeah. Alex: Hey.

1257
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:33,396
We can do it. This team can do anything.

1258
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:36,489
Nobody knows that better than me.

1259
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:39,326
- Yeah.
- Come on, you guys.

1260
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:41,289
Bring it in.

1261
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:47,000
Be aggressive.

1262
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:48,543
Be, be aggressive.

1263
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,337
Be aggressive. Be, be aggressive.

1264
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:52,460
Come on, guys.

1265
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:55,509
- That's not what I thought this was. No.
- We should just go.

1266
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:57,507
Okay, just... go, team.

1267
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:17,068
Okay. I'm gonna try to sneak in with them.

1268
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:21,615
- In this outfit, I might be able to pass. You guys stay here...
- What? No way.

1269
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:23,115
Now's the moment. Stay here.

1270
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,493
- Alex, no!
- Go. Good luck, Alex.

1271
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:32,379
- Come on.
- What are you talking about, "come on"? Bethany.

1272
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:33,466
Bethany!

1273
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:38,095
Man: Turn right.

1274
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:58,068
You there. Stay where you are.

1275
01:23:58,158 --> 01:23:59,523
Who, us?

1276
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:01,779
Are you the brothers kababik?

1277
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:05,496
- Are we the who?
- Are you the brothers kababik?

1278
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:08,123
Yes.

1279
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,451
We are them. It is we. Us.

1280
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,629
We are the brothers cadabra... kadabrik.

1281
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:15,626
He is one brother,

1282
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:19,589
and I am the other brother.

1283
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,588
We... we got different mothers.

1284
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:27,761
But we, uh... we came to get
the thing that we came to get.

1285
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:31,521
Brothers kababik,

1286
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:33,439
on behalf of Jurgen the brutal,

1287
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:35,859
welcome to zhatmire stronghold.

1288
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:37,902
Ah. Thank you.

1289
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:58,582
There's something I have to ask you.

1290
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:01,255
Okay.

1291
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:04,213
Why didn't you come visit
when you were supposed to?

1292
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:07,241
You cancel the first time,
then you were gonna come for Halloween.

1293
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:08,884
You cancel again.

1294
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:12,096
And then the next time I hear from you,
you tell me we should take a break?

1295
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:19,110
It's just... I saw all your
pictures on Instagram,

1296
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:21,529
and you looked like you were
having so much fun, and...

1297
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:27,320
I just got really insecure or something.
Like I wasn't the guy I thought I was.

1298
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:33,496
Or I wasn't the guy you thought I was.
Which would be even worse.

1299
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:40,674
Totally terrified all the time?

1300
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:45,337
I got to school, and suddenly, for the
first time ever, people really liked me.

1301
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,841
But I'm always thinking that...

1302
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:51,176
I don't know, like it's...

1303
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:55,264
Like it's just a matter of time before
somebody figures out who I really am.

1304
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:57,394
But then I see you.

1305
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:02,237
And you're the person who
makes me feel good...

1306
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:03,734
About who I really am.

1307
01:26:05,202 --> 01:26:07,568
When you're, like, scared and insecure,

1308
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:10,829
that's when you need your people the most.

1309
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:23,633
Hey, Mr. Walker.

1310
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:26,754
Why the long face?

1311
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,715
Dad joke. Sorry. Can't help it.

1312
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:34,428
Let's get you out of here.

1313
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:05,261
Okay.

1314
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,927
It's just an obstacle course.

1315
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:09,379
You were good at those.

1316
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:27,860
Eddie:
All right, all right, get a room.

1317
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:34,450
Grandpa... let's get you out of there.

1318
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:35,875
Here.

1319
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:38,461
Whoa!

1320
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:43,505
- Let's blow this joint, huh?
- We still have to find the Jewel, grandpa.

1321
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:46,083
It must be in a vault or a
treasure room or something.

1322
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:47,964
Yeah, that's how it works in these games.

1323
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:52,802
I passed a vault on the way up to this dump.
Single access, 3-foot-thick steel door.

1324
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:55,009
Only way in is through a
grate in the ceiling.

1325
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:04,737
Whoo!

1326
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:08,981
I think I got it now.

1327
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:13,284
Just stay on...

1328
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:15,620
The raised ones.

1329
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:41,062
Jurgen the brutal awaits.

1330
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:47,527
So, tell me, which brother is which?

1331
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:51,982
Um, how do you mean?

1332
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:53,658
Which brother is which?

1333
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:58,368
Which of you is Augustus
and which is tomatoli?

1334
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:00,918
Um...

1335
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,668
I am Augustus.

1336
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:06,963
And I'm tomatolik.

1337
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:10,300
Augustus kababik.

1338
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:13,378
The cleverest man in all of jumanii.

1339
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:16,427
Yes, I'm totally that man.

1340
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:19,722
- And tomatoli kababik.
- That's me.

1341
01:29:19,813 --> 01:29:21,098
The bravest eunuch.

1342
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,557
- Wait a minute, what?
- Did you say, "eunuch"?

1343
01:29:25,652 --> 01:29:26,983
Tomatoli kababik,

1344
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:30,983
everyone knows the tale
of your great and generous sacrifice.

1345
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:36,194
How you gave your testicles in order
to save the region from the floods.

1346
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:38,516
- I think there might be a little confusion.
- Of course.

1347
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:43,034
Everybody knows the story about my
little brother and his famous testicles.

1348
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:46,461
- Wherever they may be.
- Wherever they may be.

1349
01:29:46,548 --> 01:29:48,038
All right, let's back up.

1350
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:51,416
- Let's go back a little bit. Let's clear some stuff up.
- He's super brave.

1351
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:55,800
I've always been the super clever one,
and he's always been super brave.

1352
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:57,222
And super ball-less.

1353
01:29:57,309 --> 01:30:00,597
- Stop saying that! Both of my balls are right here!
- In spirit.

1354
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:01,722
It...

1355
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,640
They're here in spirit.

1356
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:05,774
Always.

1357
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:08,020
Of course.

1358
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:10,022
Right, bro?

1359
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:16,243
Right.

1360
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:19,201
I got no balls.

1361
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,080
Martha: There's the chest.

1362
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:30,042
Okay. You're up, grandpa.

1363
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:32,840
- Who, me?
- Yes. You're the cat burglar.

1364
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:33,758
Huh?

1365
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:35,210
Your character, ming.

1366
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:36,215
Ming?

1367
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:38,342
Yes, ming. That's your avatar.
That's her name.

1368
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:40,344
In your satchel, you
have a set of lockpicks.

1369
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:43,097
Lockpicks? Why would I have lockpicks?

1370
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:44,928
Because ming's the cat burglar.

1371
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:48,565
Don't you think one of you should
do this? You have the skills.

1372
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:49,983
I have the skills?

1373
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,152
Not you. Ming.

1374
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:53,697
Right.

1375
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:54,782
Ming.

1376
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:58,154
Please don't ask who ming is.

1377
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:09,880
Not bad, huh?

1378
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:14,499
Now we just gotta figure out
how to get you out of here.

1379
01:31:25,939 --> 01:31:26,939
Shall we?

1380
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:32,650
Now, that's cool.

1381
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:40,492
Welcome. May I offer you a piece of cake?

1382
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:42,869
No! No!

1383
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:44,537
Nol

1384
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:49,253
no, thank you.

1385
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:01,265
Steady.

1386
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:11,984
Ah!

1387
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:18,188
Ha! I'd like to see your
friend ming do that!

1388
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,945
We got an issue here.

1389
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:30,204
Bethany: Oh, thank you.

1390
01:32:32,839 --> 01:32:33,839
Thank you.

1391
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:46,300
Brothers kababik, I present
Jurgen the brutal.

1392
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:57,481
At last,

1393
01:32:57,572 --> 01:33:01,064
we meet on this historic day.

1394
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:04,572
Yes, it is so great to meet you.

1395
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:08,913
Your honor, if that be the falcon Jewel

1396
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,458
upon your thick and meaty neck,

1397
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,252
perhaps we should...

1398
01:33:15,465 --> 01:33:16,545
Take it.

1399
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:21,002
Today we forge an unbreakable alliance.

1400
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:23,545
Your family will join me,

1401
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:27,758
and land by land, we'll take the world.

1402
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:31,307
So I ask, on this historic day,

1403
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,520
where is she?

1404
01:33:35,485 --> 01:33:38,022
- Uh... where's who?
- Who you talking about?

1405
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:39,944
Your sister.

1406
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:41,737
Soon to be my bride.

1407
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:49,029
You know what? I think that
there's been a misunderstanding.

1408
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,990
Where is your sister?

1409
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:57,412
Which sister were we talking about?

1410
01:33:57,507 --> 01:34:00,340
Debbie or... Brooke?

1411
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,377
Or Sierra?

1412
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:07,172
Where is your sister?

1413
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:11,684
She's getting ready, back at the hotel.

1414
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:14,183
She's just doing what brides
do on their wedding day.

1415
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:18,233
Hanging with the girls, getting
her hair done, mani-pedi.

1416
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:23,229
If you've come here without your sister...

1417
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:28,443
I just might have to cut off your heads.

1418
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:30,745
- Oh, no! No, no, no. Don't.
- Hey. Hey.

1419
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:32,368
- God, no.
- Hey, get off!

1420
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:36,042
- No. No.
- So I'll ask one last time:

1421
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:39,371
Bethany: Getting a mani-pedi!
- Where is your sister?

1422
01:34:39,465 --> 01:34:40,750
I'm right here.

1423
01:34:49,309 --> 01:34:52,517
Gwendolyn hortencia lewelda kababik?

1424
01:34:52,604 --> 01:34:53,639
Is that you?

1425
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:55,063
Um...

1426
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:56,266
Yes.

1427
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:57,517
That is me.

1428
01:34:58,735 --> 01:35:00,145
Now, please,

1429
01:35:00,236 --> 01:35:03,979
o brutal one, release my brothers.

1430
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:09,450
Cavendish:
And is it your intention, on this day,

1431
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:13,496
at this hour, to wed Jurgen
the brutal of zhatmire?

1432
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:17,333
Yep. That's my plan.

1433
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:20,207
And is it your intention
to mother his children

1434
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:23,335
and forge in blood this
union with your family?

1435
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:26,466
Yes.

1436
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:28,590
Gwendolyn kababik...

1437
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:30,592
Known throughout the world

1438
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:33,425
for your beauty and cunning.

1439
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:36,974
And now you're mine.

1440
01:35:39,901 --> 01:35:40,901
Martha: Um...

1441
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:44,690
May I hold the falcon Jewel?

1442
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:48,360
Of course, my bride.

1443
01:35:49,327 --> 01:35:50,327
Thank you.

1444
01:35:52,038 --> 01:35:53,038
Get it.

1445
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:57,911
Jurgen the brutal!

1446
01:35:58,002 --> 01:36:02,587
The brothers kababik have
been delayed in gorek.

1447
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:04,414
These are impostors!

1448
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:06,757
Man: Impostors? - Sejze them!

1449
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:08,709
No, no, no. Oh, no. We can explain.

1450
01:36:08,805 --> 01:36:09,885
Oh, no, no, no.

1451
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:11,884
I forgot to tell you one thing.

1452
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:15,558
I have a boyfriend.

1453
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:24,319
Ah!

1454
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:29,280
- Get back.
- Stay back.

1455
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:30,367
- Stay away.
- Get back!

1456
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:32,567
Bethany: Get back!

1457
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:34,653
Unh!

1458
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:55,841
Get out of here! I will torch you, bitches.

1459
01:36:55,935 --> 01:36:58,051
I will literally burn your face.

1460
01:37:20,126 --> 01:37:22,367
I'll meet the brothers in gorek.

1461
01:37:22,462 --> 01:37:23,542
Kill them all!

1462
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,463
Fridge: Go get him!

1463
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:28,630
Go get the Jewel!

1464
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:30,834
Don't worry about us. Just go!

1465
01:37:32,972 --> 01:37:33,972
Backpack.

1466
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:39,846
Bethany:
Get away! I know geometry.

1467
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:43,054
I'm not messing around, you guys. Get away!

1468
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:45,310

Let's go!

1488
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:49,059
Martha: Come on, come on!
Bethany: Hurry!

1489
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:11,338
I ook!

1490
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:14,922
- Is that Spencer?
- Oh, my god.

1491
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:06,800
Nol

1492
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:13,900
Martha: Spencer!

1493
01:41:22,577 --> 01:41:24,909
Who are you?

1494
01:41:30,585 --> 01:41:32,701
I'm Dr. smolder bravestone.

1495
01:41:58,029 --> 01:41:59,029
Spencer!

1496
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:04,820
- He says to get on his back.
- Who, me?

1497
01:42:14,045 --> 01:42:15,285
Oh, no!

1498
01:42:37,526 --> 01:42:39,517
Oh, no. Milo!

1499
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:40,943
- Oh, my god.
- What's he doing?

1500
01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:42,110
Wait.

1501
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:44,609
Milo!

1502
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:55,165
Yeah, Milo!

1503
01:42:56,754 --> 01:42:58,085
Go!

1504
01:43:00,675 --> 01:43:02,461
We're coming, Spencer!

1505
01:43:06,347 --> 01:43:07,678
"Show it to the sun."

1506
01:43:08,224 --> 01:43:09,634
Grandpa, the Jewel!

1507
01:43:09,725 --> 01:43:12,512
You gotta show it to the sun! Get ready!

1508
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:21,183
Come on, Milo!

1509
01:43:21,696 --> 01:43:23,857
Fridge: Go!
Martha: Come on, come on!

1510
01:43:38,129 --> 01:43:39,835
Yeah!

1511
01:43:50,141 --> 01:43:52,177
- Call out its name.
- Call out its name.

1512
01:43:52,268 --> 01:43:53,849
Call out its name!

1513
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:56,678
All: Jumanii!

1514
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:59,935
Jumanji!

1515
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:01,025
What'd they say?

1516
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:04,522
Jumanji?

1517
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,341
On!

1518
01:44:35,436 --> 01:44:36,436
Yes!

1519
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:38,389
We won!

1520
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:41,348
- We did it!
- Hey! Ha, ha, ha!

1521
01:44:41,442 --> 01:44:43,558
- Yes!
- Put me down.

1522
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:45,358
- Put me down, goddamn it. Stop it.
- Okay.

1523
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:48,188
Is this what you were looking for?
This little thing?

1524
01:44:48,282 --> 01:44:49,897
Grandpa, you guys were incredible.

1525
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:53,610
Yeah, that's the thing about Milo.
He's got a lot of skills.

1526
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:55,035
Milo and Eddie.

1527
01:44:56,624 --> 01:44:57,784
Milo and Eddie.

1528
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:07,081
Wh... what are we doing here now?

1529
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:15,298
Whoa!

1530
01:45:17,645 --> 01:45:19,556
Well done, intrepid adventurers.

1531
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:22,309
You have saved Jumanji. Again.

1532
01:45:23,484 --> 01:45:28,148
And now, with your permission, Dr.
Bravestone, I will take the Jewel from here.

1533
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:33,484
I will protect it with my life and return it to
the care of the elder at the avian province.

1534
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:35,784
And so your work here is done.

1535
01:45:35,871 --> 01:45:39,739
All of Jumanji thanks you. And,
sadly, this is where we part.

1536
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:42,674
I don't know what's sad about it.
I'm ready to get the hell out of here.

1537
01:45:47,716 --> 01:45:48,716
What?

1538
01:45:50,594 --> 01:45:51,594
Really?

1539
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:57,802
- Hey, guys, you're not gonna believe this.
- What'd he say?

1540
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:01,511
- He says that he...
- He wants to stay.

1541
01:46:03,399 --> 01:46:06,015
He says somebody's gotta stay
and look after this place.

1542
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:10,607
And that he's 75 years old and
he just learned how to fly.

1543
01:46:13,868 --> 01:46:16,325
But he won't be able to get out.

1544
01:46:17,621 --> 01:46:18,621
He knows.

1545
01:46:22,668 --> 01:46:24,579
Oh, Milo.

1546
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:30,039
I feel like I just got you back.

1547
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:32,757
Now I'm losing you for good.

1548
01:46:35,097 --> 01:46:38,635
"You're not losing me, buddy.
I'll always be with you."

1549
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:47,268
Being your partner...

1550
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:50,317
Is one of the best things I ever got to be.

1551
01:46:53,908 --> 01:46:55,148
He says, "thank you."

1552
01:46:55,242 --> 01:46:56,242
No, no.

1553
01:46:57,202 --> 01:46:58,533
Thank you, Milo.

1554
01:47:27,399 --> 01:47:28,479
Yes!

1555
01:47:29,276 --> 01:47:30,891
Take care, Milo! Martha: Bye!

1556
01:47:32,571 --> 01:47:34,311
Bethany: Bye-bye, Mr. Walker!

1557
01:47:37,576 --> 01:47:39,737
That's my partner right there.

1558
01:47:45,584 --> 01:47:48,917
Everybody should be so lucky
to have a friend like Milo.

1559
01:48:04,812 --> 01:48:06,052
Come on, grandpa.

1560
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:07,598
Let's go home.

1561
01:48:12,152 --> 01:48:13,152
Hey, guys.

1562
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:26,872
You do it again, your ass is gonna be stuck
here, Spencer! Because I'm not coming back!

1563
01:48:50,232 --> 01:48:51,642
Everybody okay?

1564
01:48:53,193 --> 01:48:54,808
Yeah.

1565
01:48:54,903 --> 01:48:56,268
Grandpa, you okay?

1566
01:48:58,032 --> 01:48:59,693
Yeah, I'm good.

1567
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:03,863
Holy shit.

1568
01:49:17,593 --> 01:49:19,675
Strike. Square one. Counterstrike.

1569
01:49:19,762 --> 01:49:23,300
Eddie: The fat one on the bottom? Spencer:
The fat... no, the fat one above the r.

1570
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:24,971
Eddie: Okay.
Spencer: Atop number two.

1571
01:49:25,059 --> 01:49:27,391
Eddie: Yeah. Yeah.
Spencer: So strike, strike.

1572
01:49:27,478 --> 01:49:29,594
- Yeah.
- Counterstrike.

1573
01:49:29,688 --> 01:49:32,430
Then kick me. O.

1574
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:37,935
Let me tell you something.

1575
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:41,272
- Getting old...
- I know. Getting old sucks.

1576
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:44,445
Getting old...

1577
01:49:47,706 --> 01:49:49,162
Is a gift.

1578
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:53,750
I forget that sometimes.

1579
01:49:54,963 --> 01:49:56,169
But it is.

1580
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:03,005
What more could a guy possibly want?

1581
01:50:09,228 --> 01:50:10,228
Hey, guys.

1582
01:50:13,190 --> 01:50:14,555
It was really great.

1583
01:50:15,776 --> 01:50:17,482
Yeah.

1584
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:20,356
Spencer taught me how to play a video game.

1585
01:50:24,118 --> 01:50:27,781
J just hear those sleigh bells jinglin'
ring ting a tinglin' too &7

1586
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:36,376
Oh, hell, no.

1587
01:50:48,183 --> 01:50:49,468
You okay, grandpa?

1588
01:50:52,521 --> 01:50:53,806
Yeah.

1589
01:50:53,897 --> 01:50:55,728
A lot of good memories here.

1590
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:08,734
Eddie.

1591
01:51:08,829 --> 01:51:10,569
Eddie, is that you?

1592
01:51:10,664 --> 01:51:12,120
Nora.

1593
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:13,993
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

1594
01:51:14,084 --> 01:51:15,084
Hey, guys.

1595
01:51:17,796 --> 01:51:19,252
What's up, bro?

1596
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,956
So how's business?

1597
01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:23,540
Oh, you know how it is.

1598
01:51:23,635 --> 01:51:26,798
My manager quit six months
ago, moved to Philly.

1599
01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:29,505
Place has been kind of a mess ever since.

1600
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:33,184
It's hard to find people who
really know how to do this.

1601
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:34,555
Oh, well...

1602
01:51:35,564 --> 01:51:37,555
I don't have to tell you this.

1603
01:51:37,649 --> 01:51:39,185
Mmm...

1604
01:51:41,028 --> 01:51:42,814
So you need some help around here?

1605
01:51:44,364 --> 01:51:45,774
You mean it?

1606
01:51:45,866 --> 01:51:47,948
I mean, I...

1607
01:51:48,035 --> 01:51:49,491
I'd be honored.

1608
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:50,912
Well...

1609
01:51:53,165 --> 01:51:54,780
It's really good to see you, Eddie.

1610
01:51:56,251 --> 01:51:58,207
Likewise.

1611
01:52:02,174 --> 01:52:03,289
Um... heh.

1612
01:52:08,472 --> 01:52:10,963
I'm... I'm gonna take this

1613
01:52:11,475 --> 01:52:14,842
where I was going and...

1614
01:52:14,937 --> 01:52:16,222
I'll be right back.

1615
01:52:16,313 --> 01:52:18,804
You guys gotta come to New York too.

1616
01:52:18,899 --> 01:52:20,389
Yeah, I can't wait.

1617
01:52:21,443 --> 01:52:23,183
This team, forever.

1618
01:52:24,279 --> 01:52:25,439
Forever.

1619
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:26,530
Always.

1620
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:31,400
Always and forever?

1621
01:52:31,495 --> 01:52:34,487
Fridge: Yeah, let's keep close though.
- Of course, yeah.

1622
01:52:34,581 --> 01:52:36,117
One thing.

1623
01:52:36,208 --> 01:52:37,789
Can we all agree?

1624
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:39,707
Let's never go back there.

1625
01:52:39,795 --> 01:52:42,115
- I thought we already agreed on that.
Martha: That's fine.

1626
01:53:22,296 --> 01:53:24,002
Man: Sorry it's so late.

1627
01:53:24,089 --> 01:53:26,626
Yeah, it's that time of year.
Everyone's heaters are broken.

1628
01:53:26,717 --> 01:53:29,629
Oh, it's no problem. I'm
just glad you made it.

1629
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:31,426
The furnace is right over here.

1630
01:53:36,601 --> 01:53:38,762
Is that an old video game console?

1631
01:53:39,104 --> 01:53:40,139
Hm?

1632
01:53:41,023 --> 01:53:43,014
Oh, yeah, probably.

1633
01:53:43,108 --> 01:53:44,973
It belongs to my son.

1634
01:53:45,485 --> 01:53:46,485
Hm...

1635
01:53:47,029 --> 01:53:48,644
Yeah, I'm a big gamer.

1636
01:53:49,698 --> 01:53:51,404
I've never seen anything like it.

1637
01:53:56,663 --> 01:53:58,574
Janice:
Well, it looks like it's broken.

1638
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:01,866
Maybe you shouldn't touch it.
