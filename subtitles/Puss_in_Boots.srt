00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,811
Oh, no. You really don't have to tell me

332

- your whole life story, please.
- You may want to sit.

333
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:18,153
It is at times quite... painful.

334
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,905
OK, here we go.

335
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:25,494
It was a year in which
the rain had not fallen.

336
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,289
<i>The wind was big
and the basket was small.</i>

no mama, and no litterbox.</i>

It's OK, <i>pequeño.</i>
You show with the face.

[boy] Hey, Whiskers!

358
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,733
You're sitting

- [squeaks]
- Oh, come on. Is this necessary?

Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

361
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,615
Who asked you, Breakfast?

362
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,242
Remember what Imelda says, Boy Blue:

363
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,537
If you're going to blow your top,
you blow your horn instead, right?

364
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,497
- Let's spin him.
- [shrieks]

365

Please don't spin me. Do not spin me!

Not again! No! I'm gonna yolk!

367

<i>[Puss] Even though he took
my beans, the egg stood up for me,</i>

- <i>and I decided then...</i>
- [grunts]

Wow!

373
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:16,187
That was very impressive. Thanks!

[shrieks] Oh... it's you.

[whispering]
Magic beans... is what they are.

Is that what you're gonna do?

No? What's your name?

385
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:07,822
- [mews]
- You don't say much, do you?

386
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:10,367
I think I'll call you Sparky.

Whiskers?

388
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,037
Zoltar!

389
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:18,750
How about Puss?

390
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:22,629
<i>[Puss] Humpty's mind was full
of imagination and invention.</i>

[Humpty] What is that,
50 feet down there?

392
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:29,052
Here we go. Give me a... [yelling] Puss!

393
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:33,348
- [gasps]
- Look at me, Puss! I'm flying!

<i>[Puss] He spoke of legends

Oh, when I find those
magic beans, they'll grow a vine

397
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,944
straight up into the clouds,

398
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:50,407
where a terrible and a fearsome giant
hoards his greatest treasure...

399
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,201
...the Golden Goose.

400
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,578
Oh, the Golden Goose. Just one.

401
00:24:55,745 --> 00:25:00,709
Just one of her golden eggs...
could set me for life.

402
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,294
It's my destiny, Puss.

403
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:08,925
I can't really explain it,
but I just feel like I belong up there.

Oh, boy. This is awkward.

407
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:19,436
This is kind of a solo dream here.

408
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,689
I don't need any dead weight,

[purring]

What are you doing?
Oh, man, that's good.

The eye thing that you're doing,
that is really splendid.

412
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,743
OK, let me just think for a second.
All right... OK.

413

Uh... This is crazy, but...

414
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:41,541
...I am considering a partnership.

415
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,045
I just need to know one thing.

416
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,380
Can you commit?

417
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:49,799

[grunting]

420
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:56,973
OK...

421

00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,238
Ready.

426

[Humpty] I'm cracked!

438

We got red beans, green beans,

00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:49,067
coffee beans, lima beans...
but no magic beans.

440

- Would you care for a jelly bean?
- Oh, thank you.

<i>And, as years passed,
the quest for magic beans</i>

489
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:35,066
I know! I know, I never should've
tried something without you.

490
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,360
You're not stealing
lollipops anymore, Humpty.

491
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:38,736
This is getting serious.

492
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,281
You're right!
We have to be smarter about this.

493
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,658
Here, look. We need to think bigger.

494
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,577
I've been casing the silversmith
and it's perfect.

495
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:49,205
You and me, in and out, 50 seconds tops.

496
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:52,000
Will you put that away!
This is our home.

497
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,794
These people have done nothing to us.

498
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:58,423
Our home? OK, yeah, I get it now.

499
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:02,010
You get some fancy boots
and now you're too good for me?

500
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,553
That is not true.

501
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,805
We weren't born here. We're orphans!

502
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:07,765
All we got is each other,
you understand?

503
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,559
We are better than this.

504
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,478
But we're partners.

505
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,689
We are brothers.

506
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,151

509
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,660
It's Boy Blue and his gang.
I owe them some money.

510
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:29,954
They're coming for me.
Just get me over this wall.

511
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:33,916
I gotta go. Help me up the wall.
Get me up the wall. Hurry! Hurry!

[distant whistle blowing]

513
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,972
OK, I've got everything.
We did it. Come on, let's go!

514
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:49,640
How could you do this to me?!

515
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:52,268
I did you a favor!
We can finally get out of here!

516
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:55,063
This is the money of the people!
This is all they have!

Comandante, please, I can explain!

520
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:04,947
Arrest them!

[Humpty] Hurry up! Get to the bridge!

Puss! Help me. I can't get up!

Puss, save me!

when I don't think about what I lost.

551

I lost my best friend.

My only friend. And I get it now.

553
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,585
I got greedy and desperate
and I let you down.

I let myself down.

555

All I'm asking for, Puss,
is a second chance.

Give me that second chance
and I'll help you pay back San Ricardo.

- Oh, that's great.

I will do this for my mother
and for San Ricardo... not for you.

We are not partners

I will not let you down.

00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:16,545
Hiyah!

646
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:20,883
Now!

647
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,719
[Humpty screams]

648
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:27,348
We just got to make it
to that bridge! Hang on!

649
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:31,268
- Humpty! There is no bridge!
- Trust me.

00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:39,568
[both] Humpty!

[screaming]

654
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:43,531
[both gasp]

655
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:47,660
- We're going to die!
- [whinnies]

[shouts echoing]

657
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:02,258
- I hate cats.
- This is war!

00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,643
Giant's castle...

661
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,812
...here we come.

662
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,817
[Puss sighs] I must hand it to the egg.

663
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:22,778
This was a team effort.
Humpty still has his claws...

664
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:26,115
I mean, flaws.
That was what I meant, not claws.

665
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,284
He's not a cat. [chuckles nervously]

666
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,328
- Not to say there's anything wrong...
- I don't want to talk about it.

667
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:32,872
Got it.

668
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,916
[muttering] OK, we should be close!

669
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:39,211
Keep your eyes out
for any strange cloud activity!

670
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:43,090
I am called Kitty Softpaws
because I'll steal you blind

671
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:45,551
and you'll never even know I was there.

672

Kitty?

675
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,186
You are not as good as they say.

676
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,190
You're better.

677
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:05,821
I will respect your privacy.

678
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,953
[Kitty sighs] OK. I'll tell you.

679
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,748
I was just a stray...

680
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:18,584
...but I had beautiful claws.

681
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,631
One day,
a really nice couple took me in.

682
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:26,133
Gave me milk every morning.

683
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,635
Loved me.

684
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:34,475
Maybe I scratched their curtains
or played too rough with the hamster.

685
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:36,977
I don't know why they did it.

686
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:39,688
But they took my claws.

687
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:45,402
- Cat people are crazy.
- [chuckles]

688
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,321
Stop the coach! I think this is it!

689
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:57,373

Can you believe this, Puss?

693
00:41:09,802 --> 00:41:12,554
After all these years!

694
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:17,226
Here. I want you to plant them.

695
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:25,317
That... is a strange cloud.

696
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:26,944
[gasps]

697
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:31,824
[Humpty] Whoa! OK! This is it!
It's happening, hurry!

698
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:36,036
This way!

699
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,288
Good, good.
Come on, come on, come on.

700
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:40,708
Twenty-three divided by cloud depth.

701
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,543
Hole! Right here.

702
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:47,089
Now place the beans.

703
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,093
[gasps]
Place the beans carefully, please.

704
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,430
Not on top of each other.
The magic is very delicate.

705
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:58,559
OK, good. Very good.
Now just stand back.

What's happening here?

714
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,189
Maybe the magic rubbed off
in your pocket?

715
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:48,567
- That's impossible.
- OK, OK. Let's not panic.

716
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:50,778
You know, I read somewhere
that plants have feelings.

717
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:54,656
So, come on...
say something nice to it.

718
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:55,908
OK.

719
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,577
Let me just think for a second.

720
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:00,412
Hi, little plant.

- I don't see him anywhere.

You sound weird.

That's because they effervesce!

What do you think? Do I shave?

Let me show you something.

756
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:40,030
Somewhere down there,
there are two little kids,

757
00:45:40,197 --> 00:45:42,324
I don't know, maybe orphans,

758
00:45:42,491 --> 00:45:45,410
and they're laying on a hill,
staring at the clouds,

759
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,329
dreaming about the future.

760
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,165
That was me and you, Puss.

Me and you.

762
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:55,963
[Kitty] Boys!

763
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:59,091
You might want to take a look at this.

Humpty!

768
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:14,106
[Humpty] I'll fit right in
with the golden eggs.

Brilliant or what, huh?

771
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:23,532
Humpty, you're not wearing underwear!

772
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:26,201
What? Are you embarrassed?

773
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:27,619
I'm not.

774
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:32,374
[chuckles] Puss, remember when
everyone was laughing at Bean Club?

775
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:35,544
[Puss] And who is laughing now?
Ha-ha! We are!

776
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:48,223
Wow!

00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:03,572
[Humpty in normal voice]
That is our target.

779
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,907
[in normal voice] Hey, you don't
sound like an elf anymore.

780
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,784
It's because the air pressure
in here is normal.

781
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:08,952
Let's go.

782
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:16,626
So here is the plan: You two get
the golden eggs, I will fight the giant.

783
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:19,546
There's no giant to fight.
The giant's been dead for years.

784
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:21,965
- What?!
- You didn't do the reading, did you?

- They call it the Great Terror.

789
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,937
It's the monster that guards
the Golden Goose.

790
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:38,607
Legend has it that if you look at it,
you'll turn to stone.

791
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:42,319
But nobody really knows because
nobody's walked away from it alive.

792
00:47:42,486 --> 00:47:44,404

I can't help it.
Everything's rubbing and pinching!

What are you gonna do?

00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:45,090
Hit it in the head with a guitar?

811
00:48:45,257 --> 00:48:48,301
Please. Stop bringing up the guitar.

821
00:49:25,297 --> 00:49:28,884
[muffled] I said I couldn't breathe and
then you zipped the thing over my mouth!

822
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,471
Shh! Hey. You gotta
get it together. Come on!

It's egg paradise.

It's so beautiful,
I feel like I belong here.

[grunting] I thought they were
going to be like chicken size.

00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:17,432
Can you imagine laying
one of these? Ouch!

Wait a minute.
This is the goose of legend.

I know you have quite
a reputation with the ladies,

Mr. Friskie Two-Times.

You don't know me, Puss.

931
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:47,762
I'm not who you think I am.
I'm all about the score.

932
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:49,973
Come on. Look me in the eyes

care about is the gold.

943
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:20,628
[clears throat] So... I have
been thinking, Miss Softpaws,

944
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:24,591
that when we go our separate ways,
we can go our separate ways...

945

...together.

946
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:30,513
Puss, you have to go, now.

947
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,099
You do not have to push me away anymore.

948
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:35,226
- You can trust me.
- But...

949
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:37,145
Give it up for the legends
of San Ricardo,

Humpty and Puss! We did it!

OK, yeah.
Have fun with that!

955
00:56:53,161 --> 00:56:55,204
We should give her some privacy.

956
00:56:57,707 --> 00:57:00,251
I never thought we would get to here.

957
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:03,880
After all we went through...

958

...to pull this off, together.

959
00:57:08,301 --> 00:57:10,595
It is good to have my brother back.

960
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,265
Yep. Sure is.

961
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:16,935
[yawns] Well, we have
a big day tomorrow.

Kitty?

974
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:18,579
Humpty?

975
00:58:20,957 --> 00:58:22,792
I will find you.

00:59:26,022 --> 00:59:29,484
[Humpty] What do you want?
Gold? I have gold!

986
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,487
[Jill laughs]
Jack, egg's trying to bribe us.

987
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,280
[Jack chuckling] With our own gold.

988
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:36,407
[Jill] Come on now, all we want
is a little breakfast.

989
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:37,742
[Humpty] No, no, please!

990
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:39,577
[Jack] How do you like
your eggs, pumpkin?

991
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:41,162
Humpty, no!

00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,880
[all] Surprise!

[laughing]

997
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,134
What is going on?

998
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:59,305
It's a surprise party,
and the surprise is on you.

999
00:59:59,472 --> 01:00:02,058
Looks like the cat's out of the bag.

1000
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:03,684
You were in cahoots?!

1001
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:06,312
Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

1002
01:00:09,357 --> 01:00:13,528
I spent a lot of time in prison
preparing for this.

1003
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:16,531
- You set me up.
- Oh, yeah, I set you up. Of course.

1004
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:21,035
You think this was all about getting
the gold and clearing your name?

1005
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:25,665
This little adventure
was about one thing.

1006
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:27,959
Revenge.

1007
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:35,133
You never knew it, Puss...
but I was always there. [echoing]

1008
01:00:55,236 --> 01:00:59,031
You wanted to repay an old debt, Puss?
Well, so did I.

1009
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:02,118
- Why would you do this?
- You left me on that bridge!

1010
01:01:02,285 --> 01:01:04,370
You abandoned me
when I needed you the most.

1011
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:07,165
- What happened to "brothers forever"?!
- I trusted you!

1012
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,417
Well, now you're finally
gonna know what it feels like,

1013
01:01:09,584 --> 01:01:12,336
you know, to trust someone
and have them stab you in the back.

1014
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:14,297
Guards!

1015
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:19,260
Puss In Boots, you're under arrest
for the robbery of the San Ricardo Bank!

1016
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:21,429
Consider this the final
meeting of Bean Club.

1017
01:01:21,596 --> 01:01:24,182
- I should scramble you with onions!
- [shrieks]

1018
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,767
You should never have come back.

- [growls]
- [Imelda] <i>¡Pequeño!</i> Wait.

1020
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:33,649
Do not fight them, please.

1021
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:36,611
Mama! Listen to me. I can explain.

1022
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:41,199
No. Puss, no more running.

1023
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:45,494
Please stop breaking my heart
and face what you have done.

1024
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:50,291
I'm sorry, Mama.

1025
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,044
I let you down.

1026
01:01:55,922 --> 01:01:57,924
Paws where we can see them!

1027
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:01,093
Turn around... slow.

1028
01:02:03,304 --> 01:02:04,764
Slower!

1029
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:14,523
Step into the carrier... quiet-like.

1030
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:23,908
Attention! Attention, everyone!

1031
01:02:24,075 --> 01:02:26,285
If you could just come in
a little closer.

1032
01:02:26,452 --> 01:02:27,995
Ladies and gentlemen,

[Humpty laughs] Gold for everyone!

1037

Boo! Boo! Boo! [cackles]

1038
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,228
We got some fresh,
hot gold here, people!

1039
01:02:52,395 --> 01:02:56,691
Step right up! Get it hot!

One belt.

1043
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,332
And two boots...

1044
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:16,294
...once a symbol of honor.

1045
01:03:17,962 --> 01:03:20,256
One bottle of catnip?

1046
01:03:20,423 --> 01:03:23,426
Uh... it is for my glaucoma.

Well, it looks like the egg
got what he wanted.

You're talking about Humpty?

[babbles] Don't say his name!

1056
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:19,231
I used to share this cell
with that smelly thing.

1057
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:22,443
Happiest day of my life was
when he left.

1058
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:25,196
Till I realized he stole my magic beans.

1059

Wait, wait, wait!
You had the beans? Who are you?

My friends call me Jack.

1063
01:04:36,415 --> 01:04:39,627
I traded the family cow for them beans.

1064
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:41,629
Course'n, it wasn't my family's cow.

1065
01:04:41,796 --> 01:04:44,799
It was some other family's family cow.
That's why I got eight to ten.

1066
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:49,053
Always know which cow is yours.

We're all goners,
thanks to that little stinky!

1070

I told him not to take the goose,
but all he wanted was his revenge!

1071
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:05,945
Don't take the goose. Why?

Oh, no.

1075
01:05:15,037 --> 01:05:17,706
And she will be out for blood

1076
01:05:17,873 --> 01:05:21,377
when she comes back for her baby.

Drop the weapon.

1088

Very good.

1089
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:27,526
Step aside.

1090

Huh?

I hope you can forgive me.

1096
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:51,175
Apology accepted!

1097
01:06:52,593 --> 01:06:54,553
I don't really have time for you.

1098

I have to save the town
from the Great Terror!

Wait, Puss!

1100
01:06:59,016 --> 01:07:01,018
Don't you see? I'm here because...

1101
01:07:02,353 --> 01:07:04,522
I am here because you made me realize

1102

that there is something
I care about more than gold.

1103

Something?

1104
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:13,989
OK. Someone.

1105
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:16,700
He's about two feet tall,
wears high heels.

1106

Handsome?

1107

He's very handsome.

01:07:20,663 --> 01:07:22,581
- A real beefcake?
- Mm-hm.

1109
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:24,041
- A stallion?
- Yes.

- Tiger?
- Oh, brother.

1111

I saved you!

You owed me one.

1118
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:44,812
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

1119

So now you owe me two.
