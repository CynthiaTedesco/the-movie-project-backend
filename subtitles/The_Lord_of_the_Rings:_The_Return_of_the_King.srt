1
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:54,744
Be thou, Aragorn, well.

2
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,069
Father.

3
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:25,179
Father.

4
01:42:33,233 --> 01:42:36,046
I give hope to the Dúnedain.

5
01:42:39,242 --> 01:42:43,201
I have kept no hope for myself.

6
02:12:44,062 --> 02:12:47,433
Hail Earendil brightest of the Stars!

7
03:44:16,031 --> 03:44:20,656
Out of the Great Sea...

8
03:44:20,658 --> 03:44:27,057
...to Middle-Earth I am come.

9
03:44:29,356 --> 03:44:34,098
In this place will I abide...

10
03:44:34,100 --> 03:44:40,773
...and my heirs...

11
03:44:40,775 --> 03:44:50,221
...unto the ending of the world.

12
03:44:58,099 --> 03:44:59,346
Thank you.

13
03:54:16,939 --> 03:54:19,659
The sea calls us home.
