1
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,587
Ronson's down.

2
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,256
He needs medical evac.

3
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,091
Where is it? Is it there?

4
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,175
Hard drive's gone.

5
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,177
Are you sure?

6
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,141
It's gone. Give me a minute.

7
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,184
They must have it.
Get after them.

8
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,190
I'm stabilizing Ronson.

9
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,525
We don't have the time.

10
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,193
I have to stop the bleeding!

11
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,279
Leave him!

12
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,315
Have you got him?

13
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,275
He's in the black Audi.

14
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,194
What about Ronson?

15
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,361
He's been hit.

16
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,572
We're sending an emergency
evacuation squad.

17
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,282
They'll be too bloody late!

18
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:40,951
He's seen us.

19
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,496
Medical evac for Ronson
five minutes away.

20
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,837
That's all right.
You weren't using it.

21
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,258
I wasn't using that one, either.

22
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,972
Keep your head down.

23
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,133
Just get clear!

24
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,720
Tanner, which way?

25
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,513
Keep going.
I can direct you from here.

26
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,181
You both know
what's at stake here.

27
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,850
We can't afford
to lose that list.

28
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:28,976
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,132
Where are they now?

30
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,676
They appear to be on the
rooftops of the Grand Bazaar.

31
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,939
Take a left. There's a bridge.
You can cut him off.

32
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,221
Down, sir!

33
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,076
What happened?
They're on the train, ma'am.

34
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,369
What do you mean on the train?

35
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,816
I mean,
they're on top of a train.

36
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,312
Well, get after them,
for God's sake!

37
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,196
She's going out of range.

38
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,655
We've lost tracking.
We're blind here.

39
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,657
What's going on?
I'm still with them.

40
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,868
Get me CCTV,
satellite, anything!

41
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,169
What was that?

42
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,754
VW Beetles.

43
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,422
I think.

44
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,033
Bond!
He's uncoupling the cars.

45
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,823
007, are you all right?

46
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,992
Just changing carriages.

47
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,579
What's going on? Report!

48
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,414
It's rather hard
to explain, ma'am.

49
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,207
007's still in pursuit.

50
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,816
Looks like there
isn't much more road.

51
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,901
I don't think I
can go any further.

52
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,937
I may have a shot.

53
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,279
It's not clean.

54
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,031
Repeat, I do not
have a clean shot.

55
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,498
There's a tunnel ahead.
I'm gonna lose them.

56
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,292
Can you get into
a better position?

57
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,002
Negative. There's no time.

58
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,130
Take the shot.

59
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,425
I said take the shot.

60
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,470
I can't! I may hit Bond.

61
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,804
Take the bloody shot!

62
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,537
Agent down.

63
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,900
It's like being summoned
to the headmaster's study.

64
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,403
It's a new Chairman.
Just standard procedure.

65
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,655
Bloody waste of my
time is what I call it.

66
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,824
I'm sorry to have
to deal with such

67
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,909
a delicate subject at
our first encounter.

68
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,996
But...

69
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,332
I have to be frank with you.

70
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,501
I think that
would be a good idea.

71
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,548
The Prime Minister's concerned.

72
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,176
Well, you can tell him my operatives
are pursuing every avenue.

73
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,345
Have you considered
pulling out the agents?

74
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,847
I've considered every option.

75
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,266
Forgive me,
that sounds like an evasion.

76
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,351
Forgive me, but why am I here?

77
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:28,440
Three months ago, you lost the
computer drive containing the identity

78
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,025
of almost every
NATO agent embedded in

79
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,570
terrorist organizations
across the globe.

80
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,073
A list which, in the eyes of
our allies, never existed.

81
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:41,077
So if you'll forgive me, I think
you know why you're here.

82
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,037
Are we to call this
"civilian oversight"?

83
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,708
No, we're to call
this "retirement planning."

84
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,420
Your country has only the
highest respect for you

85
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,547
and your many years of service.

86
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,466
When your current
posting is completed,

87
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,719
you'll be awarded
GCMG with full honors.

88
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,889
Congratulations.

89
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:02,765
You're firing me.

90
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,310
No, ma'am, I'm here to oversee
the transition period

91
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,146
leading to your voluntary
retirement in two months' time.

92
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,164
Your successor has yet to be
appointed, so we'll be asking you...

93
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,942
I'm not an idiot, Mallory.

94
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,737
I know I can't do
this job forever

95
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,031
but I'll be damned if I'm
going to leave the department

96
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,158
in worse shape than I found it.

97
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,827
M, you've had a great run.

98
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,954
You should leave with dignity.

99
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,249
To hell with dignity. I'll
leave when the job's done.

100
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,478
Yes?

101
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,147
Now?

102
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:57,111
Ma'am, alert from Q-Branch. Someone's
trying to decrypt the stolen hard drive.

103
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,614
We're tracing
the encryption signal.

104
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,282
Localizing now.

105
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,787
Centering in the UK.

106
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,207
London.

107
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,292
Get us back to base
as soon as possible.

108
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,801
It's coming from MI6.

109
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,135
What?

110
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,429
The data packet is
linking to our network.

111
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,140
Correction.
This is behind our firewall.

112
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:27,767
We should shut down.

113
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,851
No, track it.

114
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,062
We have to know
where it's coming from.

115
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,981
Strip the headers.
Trace the source.

116
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,024
How the hell did they
get into our system?

117
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,985
Getting trace back now.

118
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,157
It appears...

119
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,244
It appears to be
your computer, ma'am.

120
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,996
Shut it down.

121
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,169
What is this?

122
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,526
For God's sake!

123
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,071
Just get out of the way!

124
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,699
Don't you recognize the car?
Madam.

125
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,019
This is CNN Breaking News.

126
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,688
Emergency crews are still
attempting to assess

127
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,191
the damage as
investigators hunt for leads

128
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,401
in what now
appears to be a major

129
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,612
terrorist attack in
the heart of London.

130
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,450
No-one has yet claimed responsibility
for what sources are calling

131
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,871
a possible "cyber-terrorist assault"
on the British Secret Service.

132
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,248
Early reports from
the scene indicate

133
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,584
at least six dead,
many more injured,

134
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,712
with victims being evacuated
to local hospitals

135
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,631
within minutes of the explosion.

136
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,818
It's time to go, ma'am.

137
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,073
I'm going to find
whoever did this.

138
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,040
Where the hell have you been?

139
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,793
Enjoying death.

140
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,714
007 reporting for duty.

141
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,681
Why didn't you call?

142
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,142
You didn't get the postcard?

143
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,394
You should try it some time.
Get away from it all.

144
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,354
It really lends perspective.

145
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,815
Ran out of drink
where you were, did they?

146
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,650
What was it you said?

147
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,153
"Take the bloody shot."

148
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,696
I made a judgment call.

149
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,324
You should have trusted me
to finish the job.

150
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,326
It was the possibility
of losing you

151
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,995
or the certainty of losing
all those other agents.

152
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,998
I made the only decision
I could and you know it.

153
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,334
I think you lost your nerve.

154
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,920
What do you expect,
a bloody apology?

155
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,713
You know the rules of the game.

156
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,256
You've been
playing it long enough.

157
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,382
We both have.

158
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,593
Maybe too long.

159
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,929
Speak for yourself.

160
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,516
Ronson didn't make it, did he?

161
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,685
No.

162
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,523
So this is it.

163
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,943
We're both played out.

164
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,071
Well, if you believe that,
why did you come back?

165
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,864
Good question.

166
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,451
Because we're under attack.

167
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,455
And you know we need you.

168
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,961
Well, I'm here.

169
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:15,299
You'll have to be debriefed and
declared fit for active service.

170
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,219
You can only return to duty
when you've passed the tests,

171
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,721
so take them seriously.

172
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,307
And a shower might be in order.

173
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,559
I'll go home and change.

174
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,730
We've sold your flat,
put your things into storage.

175
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,901
Standard procedure on the death
of an unmarried employee

176
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,278
with no next of kin.

177
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,072
You should have called.

178
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,949
I'll find a hotel.

179
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,576
Well, you're bloody
well not sleeping here.

180
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,121
The assailant hacked into
the environmental control system,

181
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,775
locked out the safety protocols

182
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,279
and turned on the gas, all of which
should have been impossible.

183
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,781
On top of that,
they hacked into her files.

184
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,201
They knew her appointments, knew
she'd be out of the building.

185
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,120
They weren't targeting her.

186
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,706
They wanted her to see it.

187
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,417
Where are we, Tanner?

188
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,835
New digs.

189
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,888
The old building was declared
"strategically vulnerable".

190
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,140
That's putting it mildly.

191
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,643
He was able to breach the most
secure computer system in Britain.

192
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,520
So we're on war footing now.

193
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,523
This was part of
Churchill's bunker.

194
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,233
We're still discovering tunnels

195
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,651
dating back to the 18th Century.

196
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,154
Quite fascinating,
if it wasn't for the rats.

197
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,822
When do I see M?

198
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:05,367
Tomorrow you'll see M and
Mallory, too, if you're lucky.

199
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:06,660
Who's Mallory?

200
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,497
The new Chairman of the Intelligence
and Security Committee.

201
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,664
Charming man.
I think you and he

202
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,166
are really going to hit it off.

203
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,420
Welcome to the new MI6.

204
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,564
We've attempted to trace
the computer message, but

205
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,692
it was sent by an asymmetrical
security algorithm,

206
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,361
which bounced the signal
all over the globe

207
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,446
through over
a thousand different servers.

208
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,240
And now that they've
accessed M's codes,

209
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,034
it's only a matter of time before
they're able to decrypt the list.

210
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,620
Q-Branch have been analyzing the
picture but so far nothing.

211
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,040
The general feeling is it's
probably someone from her past.

212
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,709
Perhaps when she was running
things in Hong Kong.

213
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,211
She's no idea what it all means.

214
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,462
You believe that?

215
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,670
The truth is, we don't have
a clue who took the list

216
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,051
or what they plan to do with it.

217
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,184
We can always do this later.

218
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,105
You know what? Let's.

219
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:26,133
I'd like to start with some
simple word associations.

220
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,636
Just tell me the first word
that pops into your head.

221
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,180
For example, I might say "Day"
and you might say...

222
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,306
Wasted.

223
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,895
All right.

224
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,609
Gun.

225
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,695
Shot.
Agent.

226
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,197
Provocateur.

227
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,281
Woman.

228
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,324
Provocatrix.

229
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,533
Heart.

230
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,660
Target.

231
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:54,870
Bird.

232
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,205
Sky.

233
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:57,414
M.

234
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,582
Bitch.

235
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,086
Sunlight.

236
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,337
Swim.

237
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,172
Moonlight.
Dance.

238
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,507
Murder.

239
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,925
Employment.

240
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,219
Country.
England.

241
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:10,889
Skyfall.

242
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,274
Done.

243
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,532
Well, this is going well.

244
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,165
Get these analyzed.

245
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,751
For her eyes only.

246
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,781
She's ready for you.

247
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,367
I'm sorry, have we met before?

248
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,286
I'm the one who
should say "sorry".

249
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,374
It was only four ribs.

250
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,876
Some of the less vital organs.

251
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,088
Nothing major.

252
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,053
Not enough
excitement in Istanbul?

253
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,805
I've been reassigned.

254
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,973
Temporary suspension
from field work.

255
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,558
Really?

256
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,310
Something to do
with killing 007.

257
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,437
Well, you gave it
your best shot.

258
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,314
That was hardly my best shot.

259
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,733
I'm not sure I
could survive your best.

260
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,652
I doubt you'll get the chance.

261
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,072
Well, do me a favor, will you? If
they do ever let you back out there,

262
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:37,825
warn me first.

263
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,161
I'm assisting Gareth Mallory
in the transition,

264
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,163
and then I'll be
back in the field.

265
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,998
That's what you want?

266
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,583
Yes, of course.

267
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,335
It's not for everyone.

268
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,754
007. It's this way.

269
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:56,260
In your defense, a moving
target is much harder to hit.

270
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,930
Then you better keep moving.

271
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,359
The whole office
goes up in smoke

272
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,236
and that bloody thing survives.

273
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:18,240
Your interior decorating tips have
always been appreciated, 007.

274
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,577
007, Gareth Mallory.

275
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,120
I hope I haven't
missed anything.

276
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,705
The PM does
prattle on in a crisis.

277
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,956
Bond.

278
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,458
Mallory.

279
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,090
I've just been
reviewing Bond's tests.

280
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,719
It seems you've passed...
by the skin of your teeth.

281
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,929
You're back on active service.

282
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,015
Congratulations.

283
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,266
Thank you.

284
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,101
I'll...

285
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,311
I'll be outside.

286
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,646
I only have one question.

287
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,232
Why not stay dead?

288
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,945
You have the perfect way out.
Go and live quietly somewhere.

289
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,324
Not many field agents get
to leave this cleanly.

290
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,117
Do you get out
in the field much?

291
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,830
You don't need to be an
operative to see the obvious.

292
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,458
It's a young man's game.

293
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,252
Look, you've been
seriously injured.

294
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,671
There's no shame in saying
you've lost a step.

295
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,758
The only shame would be not
admitting it until it's too late.

296
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,845
Hire me or fire me.
It's entirely up to you.

297
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,932
If he says he's ready,
he's ready.

298
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,519
Perhaps you can't see it,
or maybe you won't.

299
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,312
What exactly are you implying?

300
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,314
You're sentimental about him.

301
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,486
As long as I'm head of this department,
I'll choose my own operatives.

302
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,532
Fair enough.

303
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,704
Good luck, 007.

304
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,541
Don't cock it up.

305
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,383
We've analyzed
the shrapnel fragments.

306
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,829
You're lucky it
wasn't a direct hit

307
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,220
or it would have
cut you in half.

308
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,640
It's a depleted uranium shell.
Military grade.

309
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,685
Hard to get,
extremely expensive,

310
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,479
and only used by a select few.

311
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,815
Recognize anyone?

312
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,734
Him.

313
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,154
Okay. Name's Patrice.

314
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,699
He's a ghost. No known residence
or country of origin.

315
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,409
So how do we find him?

316
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:28,745
Well, luckily, we still have one
or two friends left in the CIA.

317
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,664
They're after him for the
Yemeni ambassador's murder,

318
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,541
and they're getting close.

319
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,668
Intel is he's
going to be in Shanghai

320
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,587
in two days time,
probably on a job.

321
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,339
You're to go there and await
further instructions.

322
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,425
If he turns up, he's yours.

323
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,886
Find out who he works for
and who has the list.

324
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,055
Then terminate him, for Ronson.

325
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,682
With pleasure.

326
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,531
Is there anything
else you want to tell me?

327
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,146
No.

328
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,025
Report to the new Quartermaster
for your documentation.

329
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,569
He hasn't set up
shop yet, but Tanner will

330
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,696
put you two together.
Good luck.

331
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:04,948
Thank you.

332
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,494
007.

333
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,707
You are ready for this?

334
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,126
Yes, ma'am.

335
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,215
I didn't know Bond
passed the tests.

336
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,051
He didn't.

337
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,041
Always makes me feel
a little melancholy.

338
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:59,961
A grand old warship being
ignominiously hauled away for scrap.

339
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,550
The inevitability of time,
don't you think?

340
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,554
What do you see?

341
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,183
A bloody big ship.

342
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,519
Excuse me.

343
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,270
007...

344
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,857
I'm your new Quartermaster.

345
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,277
You must be joking.

346
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,488
Why, because I'm not
wearing a lab coat?

347
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,615
Because you still have spots.

348
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,451
My complexion is
hardly relevant.

349
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,537
Well, your competence is.

350
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,331
Age is no
guarantee of efficiency.

351
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,209
And youth is no
guarantee of innovation.

352
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,336
I'll hazard I can do more damage

353
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,004
on my laptop
sitting in my pajamas

354
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,715
before my first cup of Earl Grey

355
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,508
than you can do in
a year in the field.

356
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,218
So why do you need me?

357
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,888
Every now and then
a trigger has to be pulled.

358
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,474
Or not pulled.

359
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,728
It's hard to know
which in your pajamas.

360
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,316
Q.

361
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,193
007.

362
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,949
Ticket to Shanghai.

363
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,284
Documentation and passport.

364
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,618
Thank you.

365
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:14,870
And this.

366
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,251
Walther PPK/S 9mm short.

367
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,255
There's a micro-dermal
sensor in the grip.

368
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,925
It's been coded to your palm
print so only you can fire it.

369
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:33,180
Less of a random killing machine,
more of a personal statement.

370
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,681
And this?

371
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,393
Standard issue
radio transmitter.

372
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,397
Activate it and it
broadcasts your location.

373
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,316
Distress signal.

374
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,110
And that's it.

375
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,947
A gun...

376
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,116
...and a radio.

377
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,454
Not exactly Christmas, is it?

378
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,707
Were you expecting
an exploding pen?

379
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,377
We don't really go
in for that anymore.

380
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,887
Good luck out
there in the field.

381
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,474
And please return the
equipment in one piece.

382
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,397
Brave new world.

383
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,606
Who's got the list?

384
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,864
Tell me!
Who are you working for?

385
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,997
Tanner... He's posted
the first five names.

386
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:28,167
Their cover's blown. They're in danger.
Get them out now.

387
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,917
Room service.

388
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,387
I didn't order anything.
Not even you.

389
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,389
I've got some new information.

390
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,144
Aren't you a little overqualified
to be delivering messages?

391
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,897
It's all part of
the learning curve.

392
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,316
And Q's afraid of flying.

393
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,526
Of course he is.

394
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:39,405
So whoever stole the list
has already decrypted it.

395
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,575
They posted the first
five names on the web.

396
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,952
Well, it was only
a matter of time.

397
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,537
Well, that's just the start.

398
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,582
They're posting five more next
week, and the week after.

399
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,376
It's some kind of sadistic game.

400
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,425
Cut-throat razor.

401
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,762
How very traditional.

402
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,766
Well, I like to do some things
the old-fashioned way.

403
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,063
Sometimes the old
ways are the best.

404
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,284
Are you putting your life
in my hands again?

405
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,955
M's...

406
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:32,291
...already
briefed me on the list.

407
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,628
Raising the tantalizing question

408
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,797
of what you're
really doing here.

409
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,551
My official
directive was to help...

410
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,304
"in any way I can."

411
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:49,475
Like spying for Mallory.

412
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:54,146
You know, Mallory's not as bad
as you think.

413
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,149
He's a bureaucrat.

414
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,944
You should do your homework.

415
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,114
Gareth Mallory was
a Lieutenant Colonel...

416
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,950
Lieutenant Colonel in Northern
Ireland, Hereford Regiment.

417
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,536
Spent three months
at the hands of the IRA.

418
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,999
So there's more to
him than meets the eye.

419
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,003
We'll see.

420
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,339
Keep still.

421
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:24,844
This is the tricky part.

422
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,357
Now that's better.

423
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,735
You look the part now.

424
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,157
And what part's that?

425
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,702
Old dog,

426
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,705
new tricks.

427
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:06,112
Good evening.

428
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:07,655
Evening.

429
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:09,615
Don't touch your ear.

430
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,952
I've got three exits,

431
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:15,788
lots of blind spots.

432
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,957
I've got them covered.

433
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:26,298
You look
beautiful in that dress.

434
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:28,092
You don't scrub
up so bad yourself.

435
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:31,137
It's amazing what one can do
with an extra pair of hands.

436
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,305
You're telling me.

437
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,684
Do you gamble?

438
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,519
I like a little
flutter now and then.

439
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,649
Who doesn't like
to take chances?

440
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,990
Good evening, sir.
How may I help you?

441
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,159
I'd like to cash
this in, please.

442
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,167
One moment, sir.

443
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,201
Good fortune tonight, sir.

444
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,875
Let's hope so.

445
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,552
With compliments of the house.

446
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,387
Thank you.

447
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,078
Now you can afford
to buy me a drink.

448
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:23,582
Maybe I'll even stretch to two.

449
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:27,253
I'm guessing I've got four
million euros in here.

450
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:30,214
Not bad. I like this game.

451
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,466
Why don't we play another?

452
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:35,594
I don't gamble.

453
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,599
I'm not very lucky.

454
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,935
A little like our
friend in Shanghai.

455
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,276
I've been waiting to see
who would redeem the chip.

456
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:54,154
You made such a bold entrance
into our little drama.

457
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,574
Did I over-complicate the plot?

458
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:00,786
Who doesn't appreciate
the occasional twist, Mr...?

459
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,705
Bond.

460
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,081
James Bond.

461
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,625
Severine.

462
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:11,463
So, Mr. Bond, shall we discuss your
next performance over that drink?

463
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,632
I'd like that.

464
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,804
Will your friends be joining us?

465
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,642
That, I'm afraid, is inevitable.

466
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:28,188
She's pretty.

467
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,523
Now, now.

468
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,817
If you like that sort of thing.

469
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,194
I'll keep you posted.

470
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,166
Perfect.

471
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,713
Would you mind if I asked
you a business question?

472
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,341
Depends on the question.

473
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:58,552
It has to do with death.

474
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,890
A subject in which
you're well-versed.

475
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,850
And how would you know that?

476
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:09,063
Only a certain kind of woman
wears a backless dress

477
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:12,399
with a Beretta 70
strapped to her thigh.

478
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,611
One can never be
too careful when

479
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:18,530
handsome men in
tuxedos carry Walthers.

480
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,911
I am correct in
assuming you killed Patrice?

481
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,372
Yes.

482
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,917
Might I ask why?

483
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,920
I want to meet your employer.

484
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,726
Be careful what you wish for.

485
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:50,854
You're scared.

486
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,607
Thank you for the drink,

487
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,236
Mr. Bond.

488
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,079
You put on a good show.

489
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,208
But ever since we sat down,
you haven't stopped

490
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,293
looking at your bodyguards.

491
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,297
Now, three of them
is a bit excessive.

492
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:21,218
They're controlling you.
They're not protecting you.

493
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:26,640
The tattoo on your wrist
is Macau sex trade.

494
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:31,270
You belonged to one of the houses.
What were you? 12? 13?

495
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,982
I'm guessing he
was your way out.

496
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:38,444
Perhaps you
thought you were in love.

497
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:42,322
But that was a long time ago.

498
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:46,785
You know nothing about it.

499
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:50,456
I know when a woman is afraid
and pretending not to be.

500
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,836
How much do you know about fear?

501
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,172
All there is.

502
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,300
Not like this.

503
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,471
Not like him.

504
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,348
I can help you.

505
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,476
I don't think so.

506
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:11,643
Let me try.

507
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,481
How?

508
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:18,317
Bring me to him.

509
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:22,154
Can you kill him?

510
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:23,322
Yes.

511
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:25,991
Will you?

512
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,494
Someone usually dies.

513
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,042
Perhaps you can.

514
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,469
When I leave,
they're going to kill you.

515
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:50,474
If you survive, I'm on the Chimera.
North harbor.

516
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,060
Berth seven.

517
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:56,563
We cast off in an hour.

518
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,071
Very nice to have met you,
Mr. Bond.

519
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,241
Good luck.

520
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:34,703
Good luck with that.

521
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:00,479
Thank you.

522
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:06,777
Put it all on red.

523
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,323
It's the circle of life.

524
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:36,640
Yes!

525
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,396
It's time to cast off.

526
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,524
All right.

527
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:43,915
I like you better
without your Beretta.

528
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:49,254
I feel naked without it.

529
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:07,647
Good evening.

530
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:11,234
The controversy surrounding the
Ministry of Defence has escalated today

531
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:14,988
as images of the Husein assassination
continue to circulate.

532
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:17,074
We should warn you, some viewers

533
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,950
might find these
images disturbing.

534
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,622
Captain Husein, an MI6 operative
embedded in the Middle East,

535
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:25,707
was one of
the five agents exposed

536
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,626
in what is now being considered

537
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:31,296
the greatest internal security
breach in modern British history.

538
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:35,467
The Prime Minister continues to
express public support for MI6

539
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,677
while the opposition has taken
the position...

540
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:40,532
Has taken the position we're a
bunch of antiquated bloody idiots

541
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:43,642
fighting a war we don't understand
and can't possibly win.

542
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:45,894
Look, three of my agents
are dead already.

543
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,854
Don't embroil me
in politics now.

544
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:51,316
The Prime Minister's ordered an inquiry.
You'll have to appear.

545
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:54,736
Standing in the stocks at midday?
Who's antiquated now?

546
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,147
For Christ's sake, listen to yourself.
We're a democracy,

547
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,783
accountable to the people
we're trying to defend.

548
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,994
We can't keep working in the shadows.
There are no more shadows.

549
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:04,913
You don't get this, do you?

550
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:09,376
Whoever's behind this, whoever's
doing it, he knows us.

551
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:12,754
He's one of us. He comes
from the same place as Bond.

552
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:14,881
The place you say doesn't exist.

553
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:17,676
The shadows.

554
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:57,841
It's not too late.
We could turn back now.

555
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,349
I wouldn't be so sure.

556
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:46,473
They abandoned it
almost overnight.

557
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,894
He made them think there was a
leak at the chemical plant.

558
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,607
It's amazing the panic you can
cause with a single computer.

559
01:09:57,109 --> 01:10:00,612
He wanted the island,
so he took it.

560
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,783
Does he always
get what he wants?

561
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:07,244
More than you know.

562
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:11,623
I'm sorry.

563
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,445
Hello, James. Welcome.

564
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:45,323
Do you like the island?

565
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:50,203
My grandmother had an island.

566
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,873
Nothing to boast of. You could
walk around it in an hour.

567
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,043
But still, it was,
it was a paradise for us.

568
01:10:57,878 --> 01:11:00,171
One summer, we went for a visit

569
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:04,301
and discovered the place had
been infested with rats!

570
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:08,888
They'd come on a fishing boat and
gorged themselves on coconut.

571
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:11,725
So how do you get
rats off an island?

572
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:14,394
My grandmother showed me.

573
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:18,023
We buried an oil
drum and hinged the lid,

574
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:20,400
then wired coconut
to the lid as bait.

575
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,531
And the rats would
come for the coconut and...

576
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:26,197
...they would
fall into the drum.

577
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:30,410
And after a month, you
have trapped all the rats.

578
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,079
But what do you do then?

579
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,041
Throw the drum into the ocean?

580
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:39,044
Burn it? No.

581
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:41,421
You just leave it.

582
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,758
And they begin to get hungry.

583
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,385
And one by one...

584
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,389
...they start eating each other

585
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:54,893
until there are only two left.
The two survivors.

586
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,687
And then what?
Do you kill them? No.

587
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:01,608
You take them and release them
into the trees.

588
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:04,778
But now they don't
eat coconut anymore.

589
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,447
Now they only eat rat.

590
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,451
You have changed their nature.

591
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:14,829
The two survivors,

592
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,332
this is what she made us.

593
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:22,128
I made my own choices.

594
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,506
You think you did.

595
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,092
That's her genius.

596
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:33,014
Station H.
Am I right? Hong Kong.

597
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,935
'86 to '97.

598
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,896
Back then, I was her favorite.

599
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:43,566
And you're not nearly the agent
I was, I can tell you that.

600
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:49,739
Just look at you, barely held together
by your pills and your drink.

601
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:51,616
Don't forget my
pathetic love of country.

602
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:57,288
You're still clinging to your
faith in that old woman.

603
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:00,125
When all she does is lie to you.
She never lied to me.

604
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,835
No?
No.

605
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:04,379
What did you score in your
marksmanship evaluation?

606
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:05,755
70.

607
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:08,466
40.

608
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,929
Did she tell you the psychologist
cleared you for duty?

609
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:15,348
Yes.
No. No.

610
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:28,278
Medical evaluation: Fail.
Physical evaluation: Failed.

611
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:30,780
Psychological evaluation:
"Alcohol

612
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,116
and substance
addiction indicated."

613
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:38,288
"Pathological
rejection of authority

614
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,832
based on
unresolved childhood trauma."

615
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,174
"Subject is not
approved for field duty

616
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,343
and immediate suspension
from service advised."

617
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,721
What is this if not betrayal?

618
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:58,850
She sent you after me knowing you're
not ready, knowing you'll likely die.

619
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:01,519
Mommy was very bad!

620
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:27,378
See what she's done to you?

621
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:31,382
Well, she never
tied me to a chair.

622
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,176
Her loss.

623
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,224
Are you sure this is about M?

624
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:40,683
It's about her.

625
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:43,895
And you, and me.

626
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:47,899
You see,
we are the last two rats.

627
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:50,360
We can either eat each other...

628
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:58,952
...or eat everyone else.

629
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:05,250
How you're trying to remember
your training now.

630
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,212
What's the regulation
to cover this?

631
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:16,094
Well, first time
for everything. Yes?

632
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:22,100
What makes you think
this is my first time?

633
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:25,395
Mr. Bond!

634
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:31,776
All that physical stuff...
So dull, so dull.

635
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:35,864
Chasing spies...

636
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:38,032
so old-fashioned!

637
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:43,288
Your knees must be killing you.

638
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,419
England.

639
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:52,297
The Empire! MI6!

640
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,757
You're living in a ruin as well,

641
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,634
you just don't know it yet.

642
01:15:58,012 --> 01:16:02,473
At least here there are no old ladies
giving orders and no little...

643
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:04,559
Bip!

644
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:07,145
Gadgets from
those fools in Q-Branch.

645
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:14,694
If you wanted, you could pick your
own secret missions. As I do.

646
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:20,491
Name it.

647
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:26,247
Destabilize a multinational
by manipulating stocks...

648
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:27,415
Bip. Easy.

649
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:31,836
Interrupt transmissions from a
spy satellite over Kabul...

650
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,129
Done.

651
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:37,800
Rig an election in Uganda.
All to the highest bidder.

652
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:40,511
Or a gas explosion in London.

653
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:43,181
Just point and click.

654
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:45,308
Well, everybody needs a hobby.

655
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:52,982
So what's yours?

656
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:57,195
Resurrection.

657
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:02,825
Let me show you something.

658
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:17,382
Tells a story, doesn't it?

659
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:23,346
They left the island so quickly,

660
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,223
they couldn't
decide what to take,

661
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:27,433
what to leave,
what was important.

662
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:31,688
And seeing this every day reminds
me to focus on the essentials.

663
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:35,566
There's nothing... nothing
superfluous in my life.

664
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:39,404
When a thing is redundant,
it is eliminated.

665
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:51,749
50-year-old Macallan.

666
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:55,211
A particular favorite
of yours, I understand.

667
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,757
So, what's the toast?

668
01:18:02,553 --> 01:18:04,387
"To the women we love"?

669
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:16,607
Darling.

670
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:20,278
Darling, your lovers are here.

671
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:27,285
No, no, no, no.

672
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:29,829
Stand up straight.
Keep still.

673
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,624
And whatever you do,
don't lose your head.

674
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,168
Don't lose...

675
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:36,836
your head.

676
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:41,466
Don't lose your head.

677
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:45,261
Time to redeem
your marksmanship scores.

678
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:48,139
Let's see.

679
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:53,144
Who can be the first to knock
the glass from her head?

680
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:01,986
And just to be sporting,
I'll let you go first.

681
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,507
Let's see who ends up on top.

682
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:37,355
I can't believe it.

683
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:41,150
I can't believe it!
Did you really die that day?

684
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:45,988
Is there any, any of
the old 007 left?

685
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,873
My turn.

686
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:02,380
I win.
What do you say to that?

687
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,176
It's a waste of good Scotch.

688
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:22,108
What are you going to do now? Take
me back to her? All on your own?

689
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:24,569
Who says I'm on my own?

690
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:45,923
It's the latest
thing from Q-Branch.

691
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:48,426
It's called a radio.

692
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,616
All right, time to say hello.

693
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:46,651
You're smaller than I remember!

694
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:49,654
Whereas I barely
remember you at all.

695
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:53,157
Strange. For me,
it feels just like yesterday.

696
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:56,535
Are you surprised?

697
01:21:56,828 --> 01:22:00,081
Not particularly. But then you
always were a slippery one.

698
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:02,541
Maybe that's why
you liked me so much.

699
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,377
You flatter yourself.

700
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:06,003
No remorse.

701
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:10,549
Just as I had imagined.

702
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:12,843
Regret is unprofessional.

703
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:21,185
"Regret is unprofessional."

704
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:26,357
They kept me for five months in a
room with no air. They tortured me.

705
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:29,527
And I protected your secrets.
I protected you.

706
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:33,948
But they made me suffer.
And suffer.

707
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:37,535
And suffer.

708
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,538
Until I realized...

709
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:44,041
...it was you who betrayed me.

710
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,044
You betrayed me.

711
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:51,465
So, I had only one thing left.

712
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:56,887
My cyanide capsule
in my back left molar.

713
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:59,557
You remember, right?

714
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,730
So I broke the tooth and...

715
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,232
...bit into the capsule.

716
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,234
And it...

717
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,407
It burned all my insides.

718
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:18,617
But I didn't die.

719
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,582
Life clung to me like a disease.

720
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:30,254
And then...

721
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:34,258
I understood why I had survived.

722
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:40,431
I needed to look in
your eyes one last time.

723
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,436
Well, I hope it was worth it.

724
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:51,442
Mr. Silva, you're going to be
transferred to Belmarsh Prison

725
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:54,445
where you'll be
remanded in custody

726
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:56,280
until the Crown
Prosecution Service

727
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:58,157
deem you fit to
stand trial for...

728
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,451
Say my name. Say it.

729
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:02,620
My real name.

730
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:05,164
I know you remember it.

731
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,626
Your name is on
the memorial wall

732
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:10,795
of the very
building you attacked.

733
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,297
I will have it struck off.

734
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:18,219
Soon your past will be as
nonexistent as your future.

735
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,138
I'll never see you again.

736
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:25,976
Do you know what it does to you?

737
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:30,398
Hydrogen cyanide?

738
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:45,496
Look upon your work,

739
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:47,832
Mother.

740
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:28,456
Let me know what you recover
from his computer.

741
01:25:28,582 --> 01:25:32,042
Has he transmitted the lists? If
so, to whom? I want this resolved.

742
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:33,210
Yes, ma'am.

743
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:42,052
His name is Tiago Rodriguez.

744
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:44,221
He was a brilliant agent.

745
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:48,392
But he started operating beyond
his brief, hacking the Chinese.

746
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:53,147
The handover was coming up and they
were onto him, so I gave him up.

747
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:56,400
I got six agents in return
and a peaceful transition.

748
01:25:56,776 --> 01:25:59,653
We should go, ma'am. Board of
Inquiry begins in 30 minutes.

749
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:02,156
I want to know
what's on that computer.

750
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:17,463
Now, looking at
Silva's computer,

751
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:21,884
it seems to me he's done a number
of slightly unusual things.

752
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:24,970
He's established failsafe
protocols to wipe the memory

753
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:27,640
if there's any attempt
to access certain files.

754
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:31,185
Only six people in the world could
program safeguards like that.

755
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:33,312
Of course there are.
Can you get past them?

756
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:35,648
I invented them.

757
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:40,152
Right, then.

758
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:44,657
Let's see what you've
got for us, Mr. Silva.

759
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,452
We're in.

760
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,419
Sir, what do you make of this?

761
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,260
It's his Omega site.

762
01:27:05,303 --> 01:27:06,971
Most encrypted level he has.

763
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:12,643
Looks like obfuscated code
to conceal its true purpose.

764
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:16,105
Security through obscurity.

765
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:20,526
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I might have order?

766
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:23,320
I'd like to begin
the proceedings.

767
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:28,158
We're gathered today
to address important issues

768
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:30,828
concerning the future
of our national security.

769
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:38,502
Going somewhere?

770
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:44,216
So you believe your stewardship
of MI6 during the recent crisis

771
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:45,676
has been up to scratch?

772
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:49,138
Well, I believe we have
apprehended the responsible party

773
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,015
and are taking
all necessary steps

774
01:27:51,141 --> 01:27:53,851
to ensure that the sensitive
information is contained.

775
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:56,979
So it's a job well done.

776
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,825
I'm not saying
it's gone perfectly, but...

777
01:27:58,982 --> 01:28:01,609
You'll forgive me for not
putting up the bunting.

778
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,030
I find it rather difficult
to overlook monumental

779
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,030
security breaches
and dead operatives

780
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:08,949
for which you are almost
single-handedly responsible.

781
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:14,330
He's using a polymorphic
engine to mutate the code.

782
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:16,665
Whenever I try to
gain access, it changes.

783
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,877
It's like solving a Rubik's
cube that's fighting back.

784
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:27,051
Stop.

785
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:30,179
Go in on that.

786
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:37,895
Granborough.

787
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:42,358
Granborough Road. It's an old Tube
station on the Metropolitan Line.

788
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:44,109
Been closed for years.

789
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:47,738
Use that as a key.

790
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,751
Look, it's a map!

791
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:04,088
It's London.

792
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:07,466
Subterranean London.

793
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:11,261
What's going on?
Why are the doors open?

794
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:22,731
No.

795
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:25,067
Can someone tell me how the
hell he got into our system?

796
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,698
Shit.

797
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:33,826
Shit, shit, shit.

798
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:36,787
He hacked us.

799
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:45,838
No.

800
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:55,180
Q.

801
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:57,015
He's gone.

802
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:08,569
I'm in a stairwell
below isolation.

803
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:10,320
Do you read me, Q?

804
01:30:10,447 --> 01:30:11,989
I can hear you.
I'm looking for you.

805
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,209
Got you.
Tracking your location.

806
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:26,462
Just keep moving forward.

807
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:29,047
Enter the next
service door on your right.

808
01:30:35,889 --> 01:30:38,050
If you're through that door,
you should be in the Tube.

809
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:40,142
I'm in the Tube.

810
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:44,813
Bond, this isn't an escape.
This was years in the planning.

811
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:47,524
He wanted us to capture him, he
wanted us to access his computer.

812
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,234
It was all planned.

813
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:52,863
Blowing up HQ. Knowing
the emergency protocols.

814
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:54,698
Knowing we'd retreat down here.

815
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:59,203
I've got all that. It's what he's
got planned next that worries me.

816
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:02,748
District Line is the closest. There's
a service door on your left.

817
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:05,459
Got it.

818
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:10,380
It won't open.

819
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:11,757
It will.
Put your back into it.

820
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:14,301
Why don't you come down here
and put your back into it?

821
01:31:18,056 --> 01:31:19,681
No, it's stuck.

822
01:31:20,683 --> 01:31:23,060
Good.
There's a train coming.

823
01:31:28,066 --> 01:31:29,900
That's vexing.

824
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:44,206
I'm through.

825
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:46,542
Told you.

826
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:48,627
We alerted security.
Police are on their way.

827
01:32:26,165 --> 01:32:27,457
Where are you now?

828
01:32:27,584 --> 01:32:28,834
Temple Tube station.

829
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:30,627
Along with half of London.

830
01:32:35,425 --> 01:32:36,758
I see you. There you are.

831
01:32:37,343 --> 01:32:41,013
I know where I am, Q.
Where's he?

832
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:43,098
Give us a second.
I'm looking for him.

833
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,683
Mind the gap.

834
01:32:51,608 --> 01:32:53,483
There's too many people.
I can't see him.

835
01:32:53,735 --> 01:32:55,736
Welcome to rush
hour on the Tube.

836
01:32:56,362 --> 01:32:57,988
Not something
you'd know much about.

837
01:32:58,489 --> 01:33:00,574
Mind the gap.

838
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:11,627
The train's leaving.
Do I get on the train?

839
01:33:12,211 --> 01:33:14,880
Don't get on. I'm not sure he's on it.
Give us a minute.

840
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:18,717
Do I get on the train?

841
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:25,682
Bond.

842
01:33:25,808 --> 01:33:27,643
What?
Get on the train.

843
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:43,408
He's keen to get home.

844
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:45,661
Will you open the door, please?

845
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:50,248
Open the door.

846
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:55,420
Health and Safety.
Carry on.

847
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,261
Where are you?

848
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:05,430
Take a wild guess, Q.

849
01:34:05,848 --> 01:34:08,225
He's in disguise,
dressed as a policeman.

850
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:09,851
Of course he is.

851
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:33,667
Where's he going?
Where's he going?

852
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:43,885
He's going for M. Tell Tanner.
Get her out of there.

853
01:34:44,303 --> 01:34:47,764
You've overlooked, or chosen
to ignore, hard evidence

854
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:51,518
and consistently,
almost obstinately...

855
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:54,187
Silva's escaped.
Bond's in pursuit.

856
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:57,024
We need to get you to a
secure location immediately.

857
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:59,026
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna show her my back.

858
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:01,278
Are we straining your attention?

859
01:35:02,071 --> 01:35:05,157
No. Please, Minister, proceed.

860
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:14,666
Excuse me.

861
01:35:33,269 --> 01:35:34,311
Move! Move!

862
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:39,876
It's as if you
insist on pretending

863
01:36:40,002 --> 01:36:42,003
we still live in
a golden age of espionage

864
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:44,965
where human intelligence was
the only resource available.

865
01:36:45,508 --> 01:36:47,801
Well, I find this
rather old-fashioned belief

866
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:50,220
demonstrates
a reckless disregard for...

867
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:52,639
Excuse me, Minister,
I don't mean to interrupt,

868
01:36:52,723 --> 01:36:54,850
but just for
the sake of variety,

869
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:57,310
might we actually
hear from the witness?

870
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:00,564
Of course.

871
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:05,026
Thank you.

872
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,432
I won't miss next time,
Mr. Silva.

873
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:39,269
Not bad. Not bad, James,
for a physical wreck.

874
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:41,813
Oi. Thank you.

875
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:43,273
You caught me.

876
01:37:45,193 --> 01:37:48,111
Now, here's your prize.

877
01:37:48,362 --> 01:37:51,781
The latest thing
from my local toy store.

878
01:37:52,241 --> 01:37:54,451
It's called radio.

879
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,711
I do hope that wasn't for me.

880
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:06,463
No.

881
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:08,423
But that is.

882
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:01,184
Chairman, Ministers.

883
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,812
Today I've repeatedly heard how

884
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:06,189
irrelevant my
department has become.

885
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:08,400
Why do we need agents?
The Double-O section?

886
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:10,527
Isn't it all rather quaint?

887
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:15,156
Well, I suppose I see a
different world than you do.

888
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:19,869
And the truth is that
what I see frightens me.

889
01:39:21,831 --> 01:39:25,667
I'm frightened because our enemies
are no longer known to us.

890
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:28,086
They do not exist on a map.

891
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:30,672
They're not nations.
They are individuals.

892
01:39:33,926 --> 01:39:35,510
Look around you.
Who do you fear?

893
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:39,389
Can you see a face?
A uniform? A flag? No.

894
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:42,892
Our world is not
more transparent now.

895
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:44,686
It's more opaque.

896
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:46,396
It's in the shadows.

897
01:39:47,898 --> 01:39:49,899
That's where we must do battle.

898
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:53,987
So, before you declare us
irrelevant, ask yourselves,

899
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:57,866
how safe do you feel?

900
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:04,164
I've just one more thing to say.

901
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:07,250
My late husband was a
great lover of poetry.

902
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:08,835
And...

903
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:13,256
I suppose some of it sunk in,
despite my best intentions.

904
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:18,428
And here today I remember
this, I think from Tennyson:

905
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:24,100
"We are not now that strength,

906
01:40:24,352 --> 01:40:27,103
which in old days
Moved earth and heaven;"

907
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:30,774
"That which we are, we are;"

908
01:40:31,567 --> 01:40:34,611
"One equal temper
of heroic hearts,"

909
01:40:35,237 --> 01:40:37,947
Made weak by time

910
01:40:38,366 --> 01:40:39,783
and fate,

911
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:42,619
but strong in will.

912
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,913
To strive, to seek,

913
01:40:45,748 --> 01:40:47,248
to find

914
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:49,584
and not to yield."

915
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:12,959
Go, go, go, go!

916
01:42:13,043 --> 01:42:14,043
Move!

917
01:42:14,503 --> 01:42:16,045
Move! Go! Move!

918
01:42:56,504 --> 01:42:59,589
007, what the hell are we doing?
Are you kidnapping me?

919
01:42:59,757 --> 01:43:01,424
That would be one
way of looking at it.

920
01:43:04,512 --> 01:43:06,679
Too many people are
dying because of me.

921
01:43:06,931 --> 01:43:09,098
If he wants you, he'll
have to come and get you.

922
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:11,643
We've been one step behind
Silva from the start.

923
01:43:11,727 --> 01:43:13,895
It's time to get out in front,
change the game.

924
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:16,064
And I'm to be the bait?

925
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:22,237
All right. But just us.
No one else.

926
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:26,115
Q? I need help.

927
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:28,284
I'm tracking the car.
Where are you going?

928
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:30,328
I've got M.
We're about to disappear.

929
01:43:30,829 --> 01:43:31,913
What?

930
01:43:32,122 --> 01:43:34,290
I need you to lay a trail of
breadcrumbs impossible to follow

931
01:43:34,375 --> 01:43:36,626
for anyone except Silva.
Think you can do it?

932
01:43:38,587 --> 01:43:40,547
I'm guessing this
isn't strictly official.

933
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:41,798
Not even remotely.

934
01:43:42,091 --> 01:43:45,009
So much for my promising
career in espionage.

935
01:43:53,769 --> 01:43:56,229
I'm not hiding in there,
if that's your brilliant plan.

936
01:43:56,313 --> 01:43:58,022
We're changing vehicles.

937
01:43:58,857 --> 01:44:02,277
Trouble with company cars is
they have trackers.

938
01:44:11,912 --> 01:44:14,914
And I suppose that's
completely inconspicuous.

939
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:16,791
Get in.

940
01:44:39,648 --> 01:44:41,524
It's not very comfortable,
is it?

941
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:45,528
Are you gonna
complain the whole way?

942
01:44:45,654 --> 01:44:47,697
Go on then, eject me.
See if I care.

943
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:51,993
Where are we going?

944
01:44:53,912 --> 01:44:55,204
Back in time.

945
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:58,625
Somewhere we'll
have the advantage.

946
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:01,836
It's a fine line.

947
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:04,464
Make the breadcrumb too small
and he might miss it.

948
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:06,799
Too big and Silva
will smell a rat.

949
01:45:07,217 --> 01:45:09,552
But do you think even Silva
will be able to spot that?

950
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:12,180
He's the only one who could.

951
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:15,683
Sir.

952
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:19,979
What are you doing?

953
01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:21,397
We're just... monitoring.

954
01:45:21,523 --> 01:45:24,150
Creating a false tracking
signal for Silva to follow.

955
01:45:25,069 --> 01:45:26,986
Well, sir...
Well, no.

956
01:45:27,196 --> 01:45:29,072
Excellent thinking.
Get him isolated.

957
01:45:29,239 --> 01:45:31,157
Send him on the A9.
It's the direct route.

958
01:45:31,241 --> 01:45:33,409
You can monitor his progress
more accurately

959
01:45:33,535 --> 01:45:35,370
and confirm it with
the traffic cameras.

960
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:37,622
But what if the PM finds out?

961
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:40,541
Then we're all buggered.

962
01:45:41,251 --> 01:45:42,585
Carry on.

963
01:46:24,878 --> 01:46:26,713
Is this where you grew up?

964
01:46:30,968 --> 01:46:32,844
How old were you when they died?

965
01:46:36,557 --> 01:46:38,641
You know the answer to that.

966
01:46:40,978 --> 01:46:43,104
You know the whole story.

967
01:46:50,946 --> 01:46:53,573
Orphans always make
the best recruits.

968
01:46:59,747 --> 01:47:01,330
Storm's coming.

969
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:02,517
Christ.

970
01:48:05,145 --> 01:48:07,188
No wonder you never came back.

971
01:49:00,951 --> 01:49:02,368
James.

972
01:49:02,578 --> 01:49:04,370
James Bond.

973
01:49:04,621 --> 01:49:05,621
Good God.

974
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:08,749
Are you still alive?

975
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:12,211
It's nice to see you, too.

976
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:16,966
M, this is Kincade.

977
01:49:17,467 --> 01:49:19,302
Gamekeeper here
since I was a boy.

978
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:20,887
Pleased to meet you, Emma.

979
01:49:21,013 --> 01:49:22,138
Mr. Kincade.

980
01:49:24,099 --> 01:49:25,739
You're a tad late.
They've sold the place,

981
01:49:25,976 --> 01:49:27,226
when they thought you were dead.

982
01:49:27,311 --> 01:49:28,978
It seems they were wrong.

983
01:49:30,272 --> 01:49:31,606
What are you doing here?

984
01:49:31,982 --> 01:49:33,649
Some men are coming to kill us.

985
01:49:35,319 --> 01:49:36,559
But we're gonna kill them first.

986
01:49:38,488 --> 01:49:39,906
Then we'd better get ready.

987
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:43,910
Do we still have a gun room?

988
01:49:47,623 --> 01:49:52,001
They sold the lot to a collector
from Idaho or some such place.

989
01:49:52,461 --> 01:49:54,587
They were shipped out weeks ago.

990
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:56,505
There's just...

991
01:49:57,174 --> 01:50:00,676
your father's old hunting rifle.

992
01:50:01,803 --> 01:50:03,638
We couldn't let that go.

993
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:11,020
And this is what we've got.

994
01:50:12,689 --> 01:50:15,691
There might be a couple of sticks
of dynamite from the quarry.

995
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:18,361
But if all else fails,

996
01:50:18,779 --> 01:50:23,032
sometimes the old
ways are the best.

997
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:31,540
So who is it we're
supposed to be fighting?

998
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:34,210
No "we" in it, Kincade.

999
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:36,295
This is not your fight.

1000
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:39,548
Try and stop me,
you jumped-up little shit.

1001
01:50:41,176 --> 01:50:44,595
Now, remember what I taught you.
Don't let it pull to the left.

1002
01:50:46,056 --> 01:50:47,890
I'll do my best.

1003
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:58,609
What did you say
you did for a living?

1004
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:15,626
Emma!

1005
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:18,045
I brought you some things.

1006
01:51:21,258 --> 01:51:23,426
The nights get cold here.

1007
01:51:23,885 --> 01:51:25,845
Thank you, Mr. Kincade.

1008
01:51:27,264 --> 01:51:28,345
It's a beautiful old house.

1009
01:51:28,432 --> 01:51:29,473
She is.

1010
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:35,354
And like all great ladies,
she still has her secret ways.

1011
01:51:35,856 --> 01:51:36,981
Let me show you this.

1012
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:43,446
Priest's hole?

1013
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:46,115
Yeah, from Reformation times.

1014
01:51:46,616 --> 01:51:48,784
The tunnel leads under the moor.

1015
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:51,078
If you get in danger,
this is the place to come.

1016
01:51:51,747 --> 01:51:57,043
The night I told him his parents had
died, he hid in here for two days.

1017
01:51:59,463 --> 01:52:00,629
When he did come out...

1018
01:52:01,298 --> 01:52:02,965
he wasn't a boy anymore.

1019
01:52:04,509 --> 01:52:06,761
Must get on.

1020
01:54:07,174 --> 01:54:09,091
I fucked this up, didn't I?

1021
01:54:10,802 --> 01:54:11,969
No.

1022
01:54:13,889 --> 01:54:15,598
You did your job.

1023
01:54:20,729 --> 01:54:22,396
I read your obituary of me.

1024
01:54:24,149 --> 01:54:25,274
And?

1025
01:54:25,442 --> 01:54:26,567
Appalling.

1026
01:54:27,402 --> 01:54:28,903
Yeah, I knew you'd hate it.

1027
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:33,532
I did call you "an exemplar
of British fortitude".

1028
01:54:34,409 --> 01:54:36,076
That bit was all right.

1029
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:42,416
You ready?

1030
01:54:43,001 --> 01:54:46,086
I was ready before
you were born, son.

1031
01:56:05,375 --> 01:56:06,875
Welcome to Scotland.

1032
01:57:23,745 --> 01:57:24,787
You dropped something.

1033
01:57:51,314 --> 01:57:52,356
You hurt?

1034
01:57:53,233 --> 01:57:55,567
Only my pride.
I never was a good shot.

1035
01:58:01,574 --> 01:58:04,535
He's not here.

1036
01:58:39,070 --> 01:58:40,904
Always got to make an entrance.

1037
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:44,533
You two, go to the kitchen.
Now.

1038
01:59:08,725 --> 01:59:09,725
Get behind the arch!

1039
01:59:53,186 --> 01:59:54,728
Go to the chapel.
Use the tunnel.

1040
02:01:16,644 --> 02:01:20,856
Everyone, listen to me! Don't
you dare touch her. She's mine.

1041
02:01:37,874 --> 02:01:39,394
Can your friend
come out and say hello?

1042
02:02:47,193 --> 02:02:49,277
Come on. This way.

1043
02:03:47,128 --> 02:03:49,171
I always hated this place.

1044
02:03:59,557 --> 02:04:01,016
Are you getting warm?

1045
02:05:29,981 --> 02:05:32,148
Just make sure Bond's dead!

1046
02:05:35,528 --> 02:05:37,737
Now it's me and her.

1047
02:07:35,856 --> 02:07:39,317
You see what comes of all this
running around, Mr. Bond?

1048
02:07:40,486 --> 02:07:42,737
All this jumping and fighting.

1049
02:07:42,905 --> 02:07:44,781
It's exhausting!

1050
02:07:47,952 --> 02:07:49,411
Relax.

1051
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:52,831
You need to relax.

1052
02:08:11,642 --> 02:08:14,436
Well...
Mother's calling.

1053
02:08:16,063 --> 02:08:18,189
I'll give her
a goodbye kiss for you.

1054
02:08:37,585 --> 02:08:39,627
Oh, my God.

1055
02:10:37,288 --> 02:10:39,164
Of course.

1056
02:10:39,582 --> 02:10:41,207
It had to be here.

1057
02:10:43,586 --> 02:10:45,211
It had to be this way.

1058
02:10:46,672 --> 02:10:48,131
Thank you.

1059
02:10:48,257 --> 02:10:49,966
I can't find it no...
Don't.

1060
02:10:53,929 --> 02:10:56,514
Please. Don't.

1061
02:11:11,822 --> 02:11:14,240
You're hurt. You're hurt.

1062
02:11:18,495 --> 02:11:23,082
What have they done to you?

1063
02:11:55,574 --> 02:11:57,116
Free both of us.

1064
02:11:57,576 --> 02:11:59,285
Free both of us...

1065
02:12:00,621 --> 02:12:01,871
with the same bullet.

1066
02:12:03,624 --> 02:12:06,501
Do it.

1067
02:12:08,629 --> 02:12:09,837
Only you can do it.

1068
02:12:10,631 --> 02:12:11,881
Do it.

1069
02:12:54,883 --> 02:12:56,676
Last rat standing.

1070
02:13:06,937 --> 02:13:09,939
007. What took you so long?

1071
02:13:10,232 --> 02:13:13,192
Well, I got into
some deep water.

1072
02:13:29,209 --> 02:13:31,294
I suppose it's...

1073
02:13:31,712 --> 02:13:34,047
too late to make a run for it?

1074
02:13:40,220 --> 02:13:42,138
Well, I'm game if you are.

1075
02:13:52,566 --> 02:13:54,901
I did get one thing right.

1076
02:15:21,697 --> 02:15:23,865
I didn't even know
you could come up here.

1077
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:27,034
Hate to waste a view.

1078
02:15:27,411 --> 02:15:29,120
I can see why.

1079
02:15:30,914 --> 02:15:33,791
I thought you were going
back out on active service.

1080
02:15:35,294 --> 02:15:37,086
I declined.

1081
02:15:38,755 --> 02:15:40,131
You said it yourself,

1082
02:15:40,716 --> 02:15:42,467
fieldwork's not for everyone.

1083
02:15:43,427 --> 02:15:46,304
If it helps, I feel a lot safer.

1084
02:15:51,602 --> 02:15:53,478
Her will was read today.

1085
02:15:54,396 --> 02:15:55,897
She left you this.

1086
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:11,037
Maybe it was her way of telling
you to take a desk job.

1087
02:16:11,914 --> 02:16:13,664
Just the opposite.

1088
02:16:16,877 --> 02:16:18,169
Thank you.

1089
02:16:37,105 --> 02:16:39,649
You know, we've never formally
been introduced.

1090
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:44,779
Well, my name's Eve.

1091
02:16:45,572 --> 02:16:46,989
Eve Moneypenny.

1092
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:50,535
Well, I look forward to our
time together, Miss Moneypenny.

1093
02:16:51,036 --> 02:16:55,206
Me, too. I'm sure we'll have
one or two close shaves.

1094
02:16:57,584 --> 02:16:58,626
Morning, 007.

1095
02:16:58,752 --> 02:16:59,794
Good morning, Tanner.

1096
02:17:00,212 --> 02:17:01,212
He'll see you now.

1097
02:17:16,645 --> 02:17:17,979
How's the arm, sir?

1098
02:17:18,647 --> 02:17:21,107
What? It's fine.

1099
02:17:21,233 --> 02:17:22,483
It'll get better.

1100
02:17:22,609 --> 02:17:25,486
All pretty shocking for
someone unused to fieldwork.

1101
02:17:28,490 --> 02:17:31,993
So, 007...
Lots to be done.

1102
02:17:36,164 --> 02:17:38,082
Are you ready to
get back to work?

1103
02:17:40,002 --> 02:17:42,086
With pleasure, M.

1104
02:17:44,339 --> 02:17:46,340
With pleasure.
