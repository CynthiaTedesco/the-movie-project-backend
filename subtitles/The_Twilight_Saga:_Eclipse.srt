1
00:00:13,069 --> 00:00:15,401
Took a job

2
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:17,871
Working late

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,036
Jacking cars from out of state

4
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,508
Who's there ?

5
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:05,145
Who's there?

6
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:20,930
Help!

7
00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:47,591
What do you want?

8
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,571
Some say the world will end in fire

9
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:36,711
Some say in ice

10
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,449
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire

11
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,148
But if I had to perish twice

12
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,722
I think I know enough of hate

13
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,823
To say that for destruction ice

14
00:02:56,602 --> 00:02:58,434
Is also great

15
00:03:00,273 --> 00:03:02,070
And would suffice

16
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:05,704
You know, I've got an English final.

17
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:08,004
I gotta focus.

18
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:24,328
Marry me.

19
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:26,691
No.

20
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:36,907
Marry me.

21
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:43,014
Change me.

22
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,690
Okay, I will if you marry me.

23
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:52,919
It's called a compromise.

24
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,464
Let's just call it coercion.

25
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:02,093
It's not fair.

26
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:05,765
Marriage is just...

27
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,831
It's a piece of paper.

28
00:04:09,877 --> 00:04:13,210
Where I'm from,
it's the way one says, "I love you."

29
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:18,079
Well, where I come from, at my age,

30
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:23,113
it's the way one says,
"I just got knocked up.

31
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,091
So, you're worried
about what people will think?

32
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:35,200
You know,
two out of three marriages end in divorce.

33
00:04:36,338 --> 00:04:41,742
Well, I think you'll find
the vampirelhuman divorce rate

34
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,607
is a little lower.

35
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:50,051
So marry me.

36
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:55,922
I can't.

37
00:04:57,993 --> 00:05:00,120
I have to be back at 4:00.

38
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:25,545
4:00 on the dot.

39
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:29,049
That kid trying to brown-nose me now
or something?

40
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,251
He has a name.
Now he's too punctual for you?

41
00:05:41,638 --> 00:05:42,832
Okay....

42
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:46,940
You understand
why you're being punished, right?

43
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,942
I know, I put you through hell.

44
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:51,605
Yes, you did.

45
00:05:53,316 --> 00:05:56,342
But I have other reasons for grounding you.

46
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:57,716
Like...

47
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:04,860
I just want you to get some separation
from him.

48
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:10,289
Dad, there's nothing you can say.

49
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:14,398
Edward is in my life.

50
00:06:16,907 --> 00:06:18,966
Yeah, I'm gathering that.

51
00:06:21,078 --> 00:06:23,638
So, all right, how about this?

52
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:26,248
I'll make you a deal.

53
00:06:27,284 --> 00:06:29,844
You're not grounded anymore

54
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:37,091
if you use your new-found freedom to
see some of your other friends, too, like...

55
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:38,952
Like Jacob.

56
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:41,458
He's going through
a really tough time right now.

57
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:43,727
His dad's really worried about him.

58
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:46,532
I remember when that was you.

59
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:49,604
You needed a friend.

60
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:51,566
Jake was there.

61
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:58,380
Hey, it's Jake. Leave a message.

62
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:03,450
Jacob hadn't talked to me in weeks.

63
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:08,125
I wanted to fix it, he just...
He wouldn't give me the chance.

64
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:23,492
''I miss you too.
Doesn't change anything.''

65
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:13,386
And tumbling, tumbling

66
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,159
Don't go fascination

67
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:25,442
If just for tonight darling, let's get lost

68
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,380
If just for tonight darling

69
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,448
Let's get lost

70
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:40,788
If just for tonight darling

71
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:43,384
Let's get lost

72
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,440
You scared me.

73
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,983
You're going down to the reservation.

74
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,678
How did you...

75
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,384
Alice.

76
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,384
Hey, did you do this to my truck?

77
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,688
Bella, you have to understand.

78
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,528
Your safety is everything to me.

79
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,033
Jacob's not gonna hurt me.

80
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,832
Not intentionally,
but the wolves have no control.

81
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:26,929
Edward.

82
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:31,304
I have.... until graduation to see him.

83
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,605
And then I'll be one of you,

84
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,416
and he'll hate me forever.

85
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,514
Well, I'm sorry.

86
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,729
No way. Stop.
Throw it away.

87
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,132
Good.
Hey.

88
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,763
Just in time. All right, check it out.
All right. Let's see, we got.

89
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,364
My fellow students. Right?
Good.

90
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,739
Cute.
Right? We are the future.

91
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,108
Anything is possible, if you just believe.

92
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:06,703
Nice.

93
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:08,251
Blah, blah, blah...

94
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,237
Perfect.

95
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,544
And you got yourself a speech.

96
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,882
No, this'll be my speech when I want
everyone to throw diplomas at my head.

97
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,546
So, thank you.

98
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,655
You gotta embrace the clichés, Jess.

99
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,091
They are the bread and butter
of all valedictorians.

100
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,722
And that is why you are not valedictorian.

101
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,924
And Jess doesn't need clichés.

102
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,091
The speech is gonna be epic.

103
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,767
Epic? It'll change lives.

104
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:32,166
I've decided to throw a party.

105
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:35,440
After all, how many times
are we gonna graduate high school?

106
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:37,667
A party? At your place?

107
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:40,906
I've never seen your house.

108
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:42,506
No one's ever seen their house.

109
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,274
Another party, Alice?

110
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:45,711
It'll be fun.

111
00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:47,482
Yeah. That's what you said last time.

112
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:54,018
Hey, Angela.
Yeah?

113
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,084
Do you need some help with those?

114
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:03,161
be sending money
'cause it's the polite thing to do,

115
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:04,295
and then you'll be raking it in.

116
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:06,397
Wait a minute. People give you money?

117
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:27,553
I know you know what she saw. Tell me.

118
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,457
It was nothing.

119
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:32,228
You looked worried.

120
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:36,602
Just that everyone noticed
how strange Alice is.

121
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:40,041
I think that ship sailed long ago.

122
00:10:43,378 --> 00:10:45,243
I wonder what's wrong.

123
00:10:45,314 --> 00:10:48,078
Their son went missing in Seattle
over a year ago.

124
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:50,811
Charlie's doing what he can, but...

125
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:55,586
You know something about this?

126
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:01,527
We've been tracking the situation in Seattle
for a while.

127
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:04,931
Unexplained disappearances. Killings.

128
00:11:05,735 --> 00:11:10,035
If the situation gets any more conspicuous,
the Volturi will step in.

129
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:14,102
If they go to Seattle, they could come here.

130
00:11:14,177 --> 00:11:15,644
They could see I'm still human.

131
00:11:15,712 --> 00:11:17,304
It won't get that far.

132
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:20,243
But we'll go to Seattle if we have to.

133
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:24,979
I'll fax these down, first thing.
Thank you.

134
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:27,680
Hey.
Hey.

135
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:31,620
You ready for dinner?
Yeah.

136
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:34,759
It is still just you and I, right?

137
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:38,163
No, I'm just dropping her off.

138
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:40,026
See you later.

139
00:11:40,136 --> 00:11:41,296
Bye.

140
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:47,431
Bella, my parents wanted to remind you
about the airline ticket

141
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,479
you got for your birthday.
What airline ticket?

142
00:11:52,148 --> 00:11:54,777
A round trip ticket to see Mom in Florida.

143
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,084
That was generous.

144
00:11:57,154 --> 00:11:59,588
It expires soon,
so you might want to use it this weekend.

145
00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:02,649
Well, I can't just drop everything and go.

146
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,988
It might be your last chance to see her
before you graduate.

147
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:09,198
Might not be a bad idea.

148
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:12,633
Get out of town for a couple days.
Get some distance.

149
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:15,098
Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing Mom.

150
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,202
As long as you use the companion ticket.

151
00:12:19,276 --> 00:12:21,403
Wait. There's two tickets?

152
00:12:23,914 --> 00:12:25,245
Super.

153
00:12:25,582 --> 00:12:27,777
That makes me really happy.

154
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:32,652
I did want to see my mom.

155
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:36,284
I wanted to know
that her life was full and satisfying.

156
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,690
Aren't you gonna miss this?

157
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:44,567
Can't you just feel the vitamin D
soaking up in your pores?

158
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,467
Yeah, I am gonna miss this.

159
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:55,310
You know, colleges in Florida
are a lot sunnier.

160
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:02,478
I'm just saying,
if you go to the University of Alaska,

161
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:04,579
I'm never gonna see you.

162
00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:11,127
They have a really great science program.

163
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:13,855
You mean, Edward program?

164
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:18,993
The way he watches you,

165
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:23,033
it's like he's willing to leap in front of you
and take a bullet or something.

166
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:25,472
Is that a bad thing?

167
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:27,542
It's an intense thing.

168
00:13:28,713 --> 00:13:30,772
You're different with him.

169
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,343
He moves, you move.

170
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,511
Like magnets.

171
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:38,720
I don't know, we're just...

172
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,657
In love. I get it.

173
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:46,954
I just want to make sure
you're making the right choices for you.

174
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:49,700
You know, 'cause you're the one
that's gonna have to live with them.

175
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:56,368
All right, enough with the heavy.

176
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:04,541
Mom.

177
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:06,448
Congraduation.

178
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,282
I didn't want you
to spend any of your money.

179
00:14:08,354 --> 00:14:10,117
I didn't, come on.

180
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:25,798
Are these all our old trip T-shirts?
Mmm-hmm.

181
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:28,272
Get out!
I saved them all.

182
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:31,367
I thought they'd make a good quilt,
keep you warm up in Alaska.

183
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:35,413
Remember this one? Ensenada.

184
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,051
The Snake Pit.
Yeah.

185
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:41,481
But this one is my favorite, here.

186
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:43,614
The three-headed lobster from Maine.

187
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:46,687
This is amazing.
Honey, I'm glad you like it.

188
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,250
I just figured, you know,
when you get older,

189
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:49,625
have kids, we can add to it.

190
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:52,563
Maybe go visit the world's largest
ketchup bottle or something.

191
00:14:52,632 --> 00:14:53,929
Thanks.

192
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,335
I'm glad you like it.

193
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:02,308
Just thought you should have
a little piece of me up there in Alaska.

194
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:06,709
Mom...
Yeah?

195
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:11,952
I miss you.

196
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,921
Honey, I miss you, too.

197
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,041
Are you sure this is where you saw her?

198
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,973
She's almost here.

199
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:51,981
On your left!

200
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:29,188
Wait!

201
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:30,761
She's in their territory.

202
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:33,896
She'll get away!

203
00:16:35,604 --> 00:16:37,162
No, she won't!

204
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:13,833
Emmett, no!

205
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:48,637
Do you regret going?

206
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:51,906
No.

207
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,848
It was really great seeing my mom.

208
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:58,687
Just really hard saying goodbye.

209
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:01,150
It doesn't have to be goodbye.

210
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:03,352
Is that why you asked me to go?

211
00:18:03,494 --> 00:18:06,327
You thought I was gonna change my mind?

212
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:09,226
I'm always hoping for that.

213
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,028
What?

214
00:18:13,537 --> 00:18:16,370
If I asked you to stay in the car, would you?

215
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,045
Of course not.

216
00:18:36,561 --> 00:18:37,755
Hey.

217
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:40,362
Charlie said you left town.

218
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:42,828
Yeah. To visit my mom. Why?

219
00:18:43,802 --> 00:18:46,532
He's checking to see if you're still human.

220
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:48,734
Look, I'm here to warn you.

221
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:51,602
If your kind come on our land again...

222
00:18:52,377 --> 00:18:53,401
Wait, what?

223
00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:57,271
You didn't tell her?

224
00:18:57,682 --> 00:18:58,876
Just leave it alone, Jacob.

225
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:01,974
Tell me what?

226
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:06,057
Emmett and Paul had a misunderstanding.

227
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:08,087
It's nothing to worry about.

228
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,490
Listen to you.

229
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:11,689
Did you lie to get her out of town, too?

230
00:19:11,763 --> 00:19:13,492
You should just leave.

231
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:15,090
Now.

232
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:17,994
She has a right to know.

233
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:20,229
She is the one the redhead wants.

234
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,433
Victoria?

235
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:26,871
Alice's vision.

236
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:29,938
I was trying to protect you.

237
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:31,943
By lying to me.

238
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:37,716
Okay, we're gonna talk about this, but...

239
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,916
You.

240
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:41,958
Why haven't you called me back?

241
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,464
I had nothing to say.

242
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:51,225
Well, I have tons. Hold on.
Hey.

243
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:54,536
Bella.

244
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:56,534
Edward, you have to trust me.

245
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,201
I do trust you.

246
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:00,243
It's him I don't trust.

247
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:14,858
Hey, lose the grin, Jacob.
We're just going for a ride.

248
00:20:14,928 --> 00:20:15,952
Hold on tight.

249
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:24,094
Last born of the clan

250
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:27,299
First one to be free

251
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:30,366
Lived inside a house

252
00:20:30,444 --> 00:20:32,605
Are you sure this is a good idea?

253
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:36,649
I am the vampire girl, remember?

254
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:39,217
Hey, look who's back!

255
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:40,442
What up, Bella?

256
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,181
Quil? You, too?
Yep.

257
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:43,682
Finally made the pack.

258
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:45,281
I'm glad you're here, Bella.

259
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:48,020
Maybe we can get a break
from Jake's obsessive inner monologue.

260
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:49,186
I wish Bella would call.

261
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:50,994
I wish Bella wouldn't call.

262
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:53,863
Maybe I should call Bella.
Maybe I should call Bella and hang up.

263
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:57,330
All right, you can shut up now.

264
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,735
Bella, this is Leah Clearwater,
Harry's daughter.

265
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:07,338
Hey. I'm really sorry about your father.

266
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:10,148
If you're here to torture Jacob some more,
feel free to leave.

267
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:15,047
Fun, isn't she?

268
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,884
Bella, hi!
Hey.

269
00:21:19,193 --> 00:21:22,060
I was wondering
when we'd see your face around here again.

270
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:23,494
Yeah. Same here.

271
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:24,653
Sam, we good?

272
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:28,393
We're good. She won't be getting
through our line any time soon.

273
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:30,460
Cool.
Yeah, that's right boys!

274
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:42,080
So when did Leah join the pack?

275
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,214
Around when her dad died.
Her brother, Seth, also phased.

276
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,320
He's only 15,
one of the youngest we've had.

277
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:54,526
Sam keeps him home studying,
but he's chomping at the bit.

278
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,127
I wish it was Leah who'd stay home.

279
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,528
Come on, don't be such a guy.

280
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:03,070
No, it's not a chick thing.

281
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:06,236
It's, you know, a triangle thing.

282
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,470
We all have to live
the LeahlSamlEmily pain-fest.

283
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,245
Wolf telepathy, remember?

284
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:16,076
So Sam dumps Leah for Emily?

285
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,620
Yeah, it wasn't like that.
Sam hates himself for hurting Leah.

286
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,949
But Emily was the one.

287
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,058
I guess it sort of chooses you sometimes.

288
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,033
It's more than some crush, Bella.

289
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,262
Sam imprinted on Emily.

290
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:38,367
Do I even want to know what that is?

291
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,212
Imprinting on someone is like...

292
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:54,648
Like when you see her,

293
00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:57,722
everything changes.

294
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:03,028
All of a sudden,
it's not gravity holding you to the planet.

295
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,430
It's her.

296
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:08,201
Nothing else matters.

297
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:11,464
You would do anything,

298
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:14,805
be anything for her.

299
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,079
Sounds like you know the feeling.

300
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:25,252
Have you

301
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:29,326
imprinted on someone?

302
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:35,921
You'd know if I had.

303
00:23:40,104 --> 00:23:43,130
I just have a direct line to Sam's thoughts.

304
00:23:44,942 --> 00:23:46,671
So for now you're

305
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:48,473
still you.

306
00:23:51,115 --> 00:23:53,140
And you're still you.

307
00:23:54,318 --> 00:23:55,478
Yeah.

308
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:02,322
Until graduation.

309
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:05,459
Graduation?

310
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:08,827
You knew this was gonna happen.

311
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,992
Not in a month!

312
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:16,440
I mean, not before you've...
You've even lived.

313
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:19,501
Or before I could...

314
00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:27,146
For a second, just a second, I thought...

315
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:31,384
But he's got his hooks in you so deep...

316
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,855
I decided this, not him.

317
00:24:34,926 --> 00:24:37,292
Bella, they're not even alive.

318
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:39,854
It makes me sick.

319
00:24:42,534 --> 00:24:45,332
Better you really be dead than one of them.

320
00:24:58,651 --> 00:25:00,084
I can't believe you said that.

321
00:25:04,757 --> 00:25:06,987
Edward was right, I shouldn't have come.

322
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:09,960
Bella, come on. Please.

323
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:14,293
I'm sorry.

324
00:26:24,037 --> 00:26:28,337
You know, Edward could
at least respect meal times.

325
00:26:29,142 --> 00:26:30,404
I was just with Jake.

326
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:32,267
Oh.

327
00:26:33,547 --> 00:26:34,845
Good.

328
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:42,786
I'll just give you two some privacy, then.

329
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:47,094
Hey.
Do you understand how worried I've been?

330
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:48,928
I was perfectly safe.

331
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:51,157
I almost broke the treaty to make sure.

332
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:55,327
I know I smell like a dog. I'm sorry.
No, something's wrong.

333
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,171
Edward, what's wrong?

334
00:27:04,245 --> 00:27:06,236
Someone's been in here.

335
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:13,910
Who was it?
Someone we know?

336
00:27:14,856 --> 00:27:17,950
This stranger, I didn't recognize his scent.

337
00:27:18,025 --> 00:27:19,686
A nomad passing through?

338
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,728
A passerby wouldn't
have left Bella's father alive.

339
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,133
The scent disappeared
about 5 miles south of Bella's house.

340
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:28,902
Someone's orchestrating this.

341
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:30,336
Victoria?

342
00:27:31,006 --> 00:27:32,564
I would have seen her decide.

343
00:27:32,808 --> 00:27:33,900
Has to be the Volturi.

344
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,238
I don't think it's the Volturi, either.

345
00:27:37,312 --> 00:27:39,075
I've been watching Aro's decisions, too.

346
00:27:39,147 --> 00:27:40,478
So we keep looking.

347
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:42,983
We'll also take shifts
guarding Bella at her house.

348
00:27:43,485 --> 00:27:44,884
Another protection detail?

349
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:46,684
Rosalie.

350
00:27:47,756 --> 00:27:48,745
No, she's right.

351
00:27:49,224 --> 00:27:53,661
You can't protect me, watch my dad
and search for the intruder.

352
00:27:53,729 --> 00:27:55,492
And for Victoria.

353
00:27:55,564 --> 00:27:57,225
And keep yourselves fed.

354
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,096
I'm not leaving you here defenseless.

355
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:01,727
Well, I'm not gonna let you starve.

356
00:28:02,204 --> 00:28:04,195
And I wouldn't be unprotected. I have...

357
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:07,436
What?

358
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,548
Whoever it was, he left his stink behind.

359
00:28:18,254 --> 00:28:21,985
It'll be hard to miss when we cross it again.
We'll handle it from here.

360
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:24,853
We don't need you to handle anything.

361
00:28:24,928 --> 00:28:26,020
Or anyone.

362
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:27,756
I could care less what you need.

363
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,764
All right, we're done here.

364
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:31,800
No, you're done here.
Stop!

365
00:28:32,635 --> 00:28:36,127
I'm tired of this.
From now on, I'm Switzerland, okay?

366
00:28:37,473 --> 00:28:39,407
Edward hated the idea,

367
00:28:39,475 --> 00:28:42,171
but it wasn't about rivalry anymore.

368
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:45,609
It was about my safety, and Charlie's.

369
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:51,120
In the days that followed,
I got them to at least try to work together.

370
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:59,222
The wolves took over
so the Cullens could hunt.

371
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:04,293
It wasn't exactly an easy alliance.

372
00:29:20,651 --> 00:29:21,913
Doesn't he own a shirt?

373
00:29:27,157 --> 00:29:28,454
I'm good here. You should go.

374
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,353
I'm not gonna be gone long.

375
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:33,988
Don't rush. You need to hunt.

376
00:29:50,715 --> 00:29:52,649
Maybe rush a little bit.

377
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:00,086
Hey, beautiful.
Hi.

378
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:12,765
So, what do you wanna do today?

379
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:15,829
Bike, hike, just hang? Your call.

380
00:30:16,341 --> 00:30:18,241
But we're going to a party tonight.

381
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:22,977
Are you sure this is okay?

382
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:25,879
I really hate being a party crasher.

383
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:28,980
Technically,
you're a council meeting crasher.

384
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:34,385
You see? The council leaders,
Dad, Quil's grandpa and Sue Clearwater.

385
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,351
She took over for Harry when he died.

386
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:39,227
Okay, I should not be here.

387
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,424
You're okay. I thought...

388
00:30:43,536 --> 00:30:47,233
I mean, they thought it would
be good for you to hear the histories.

389
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:48,864
The histories?

390
00:30:49,442 --> 00:30:52,343
The tribe's histories? Aren't they secret?

391
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:56,808
We all got a role to play,
and you're part of this.

392
00:30:57,616 --> 00:31:00,642
I mean, it's the first time
Seth, Leah and Quil'll hear them, too.

393
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:03,882
But you are the first outsider. Ever.

394
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:09,193
If I had known that, I would have, like...

395
00:31:10,096 --> 00:31:12,496
I don't know, dressed better.
Jake!

396
00:31:13,766 --> 00:31:16,758
Hey.
It's about time you got here.

397
00:31:16,836 --> 00:31:19,862
Paul's been hoovering the grub,
but I saved you some burgers.

398
00:31:19,939 --> 00:31:21,770
Good looking out, bro.

399
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:24,976
Bella, this is Seth Clearwater,
Leah's brother.

400
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:26,375
Hi.
Newest member of the pack.

401
00:31:27,113 --> 00:31:29,207
Newest. Bestest. Brightest.

402
00:31:29,282 --> 00:31:30,772
And slowest.

403
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:36,388
Come on, your dad's about to start.
Okay.

404
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:41,454
The Quileutes have been a small tribe
from the beginning,

405
00:31:42,095 --> 00:31:45,121
but we have always had magic in our blood.

406
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,562
We were great spirit warriors,

407
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:53,730
shape-shifters that transformed
to the powerful wolf.

408
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:59,167
This enabled us to scare off our enemies

409
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:01,505
and protect our tribe.

410
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:08,112
One day,
our warriors came across a creature.

411
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:11,648
It looked like a man,

412
00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:13,920
but it was hard like stone

413
00:32:14,694 --> 00:32:16,560
and cold as ice.

414
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:40,812
Our warriors' sharp teeth
finally tore it apart,

415
00:32:40,888 --> 00:32:44,085
but only fire would completely destroy it.

416
00:32:45,493 --> 00:32:48,826
They lived in fear
that the cold man was not alone.

417
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:51,896
And they were right.

418
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:59,239
She took her vengeance out on the village.

419
00:33:01,876 --> 00:33:04,208
Our elder chief, Taha Aki,

420
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:09,376
was the only spirit warrior left
to save the tribe after his son was killed.

421
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:25,222
Taha Aki's third wife
could see that he would lose.

422
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:29,800
The third wife was no magical being,

423
00:33:30,505 --> 00:33:32,735
with no special powers but one,

424
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:36,004
courage.

425
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:50,752
The third wife's sacrifice
distracted the cold woman

426
00:33:50,826 --> 00:33:53,420
long enough for Taha Aki to destroy her.

427
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:57,262
She saved the tribe.

428
00:33:57,767 --> 00:34:00,861
Over time, our enemies have disappeared.

429
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:03,835
But one remains,

430
00:34:05,341 --> 00:34:06,831
the cold ones.

431
00:34:09,779 --> 00:34:12,077
Our magic awakens when they're near,

432
00:34:12,348 --> 00:34:14,213
and we sense it now.

433
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:15,717
We feel the threat in our blood.

434
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:20,248
Something terrible is coming,

435
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:24,658
and we must all be ready,

436
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:26,925
all of us.

437
00:34:54,224 --> 00:34:56,215
What did you do to me?

438
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:01,821
I'm so...

439
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,129
Yeah. I know.

440
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:06,997
We'll find you someone to drink.

441
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:08,493
Mine!

442
00:35:15,846 --> 00:35:18,542
Just try not to get killed, will you?

443
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:24,011
I'm gonna need numbers.

444
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,619
Seattle is in a state of terror.

445
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:31,559
Police are baffled by
the escalating murders and disappearances.

446
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:35,531
Theories range from a vicious new gang
to a wildly active serial killer.

447
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,624
Reporting live...

448
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:40,000
It's getting worse.
We're going to have to do something.

449
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:44,505
It takes more than one of our kind
to cause the damage they're reporting.

450
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:48,735
Quite a few more.
And they're undisciplined, conspicuous.

451
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,178
It's newborns.

452
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,714
What, like new vampires?

453
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,810
In the first few months after the change.

454
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:59,482
That's when
we're at our most uncontrollable. Vicious.

455
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,021
Insane with thirst.

456
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,824
Something to look forward to.

457
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:09,758
No one's trained these newborns,
but this isn't random.

458
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,760
Someone's creating an army.

459
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:15,231
Well, now we're definitely going to Seattle.

460
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,002
An army of vampires?

461
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,067
And they've been created to fight someone.

462
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,841
We're the only clan even close to Seattle.

463
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:23,381
Regardless of why
they were made,

464
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:26,577
if we don't put a stop to them,
the Volturi will.

465
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,711
I'm surprised they've let it go on this long.

466
00:36:28,788 --> 00:36:30,221
Maybe they're behind it.

467
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,186
In Italy, I read Aro's mind.

468
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,023
He wants me and Alice to join him,

469
00:36:36,095 --> 00:36:39,258
but he knows we'll never choose him
as long as our family's still alive.

470
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,993
An army could solve that for him.

471
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:51,803
Hey.

472
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:54,475
Did you eat dinner yet?

473
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,077
No, I haven't.

474
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,686
This kid, Riley Biers,
disappeared over a year ago,

475
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:10,354
and his poor parents have been papering
Seattle with these things ever since.

476
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,923
You think they should just give up?

477
00:37:16,937 --> 00:37:19,565
Well, I wouldn't if it were you.

478
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:23,407
Not ever.

479
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:31,649
I have to figure out
what to tell people.

480
00:37:32,819 --> 00:37:35,481
Why I won't be home for Christmases,

481
00:37:36,122 --> 00:37:38,317
and why I won't visit,

482
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,485
why they'll never see me again.

483
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:46,563
After a few decades,
everyone you know will be dead.

484
00:37:49,302 --> 00:37:50,633
Problem solved.

485
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:58,334
Why are you so against
me becoming like you?

486
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,472
I've told you.

487
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:05,280
Be honest with me.

488
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:08,054
There's more.

489
00:38:08,523 --> 00:38:12,983
I know the consequences
of this choice you're making.

490
00:38:18,232 --> 00:38:19,631
I've lived through it.

491
00:38:21,502 --> 00:38:24,130
And to let you suffer that...

492
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:29,268
You believe I have a soul, and I don't.

493
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,372
But to risk yours,

494
00:38:34,448 --> 00:38:37,542
just for the sake of
never having to lose you,

495
00:38:39,854 --> 00:38:42,118
that's the most selfish thing I'll ever do.

496
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:50,521
I thought that you were afraid
that I'd be too different.

497
00:38:52,701 --> 00:38:57,900
You know, like, I wouldn't be warm,
and I wouldn't smell the same.

498
00:39:07,649 --> 00:39:09,276
You'll always be my Bella.

499
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:33,530
My Bella, just less fragile.

500
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,613
Gosh, it's so pretty here.

501
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:55,255
So, Alice has planned
a big graduation party.

502
00:39:56,399 --> 00:39:57,491
Which you're invited to.

503
00:40:02,205 --> 00:40:04,867
Yeah, I figured that.

504
00:40:12,615 --> 00:40:13,775
What?

505
00:40:15,752 --> 00:40:18,277
I just wanted to do this differently.

506
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,019
Smoother.

507
00:40:21,591 --> 00:40:23,525
But now I'm out of time.

508
00:40:24,862 --> 00:40:26,159
Do what?

509
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:29,659
You need to hear the truth, Bella,

510
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,632
understand all your options.

511
00:40:34,204 --> 00:40:35,967
And you need to know

512
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,771
that I'm in love with you,

513
00:40:41,245 --> 00:40:44,271
and I want you to choose me
instead of him.

514
00:40:46,316 --> 00:40:48,511
I thought you understood.

515
00:40:51,355 --> 00:40:53,823
I don't feel that way for you.
I don't buy it.

516
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:55,791
What don't you buy?

517
00:40:57,294 --> 00:40:58,591
That's how I feel.

518
00:40:59,363 --> 00:41:02,924
You feel something else for me.
You just won't admit it.

519
00:41:04,268 --> 00:41:06,236
So I'm not giving up.

520
00:41:07,037 --> 00:41:09,164
I'm gonna fight for you

521
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:14,671
until your heart stops beating.

522
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:16,775
Well, then you're not gonna
have to fight for long.

523
00:41:16,848 --> 00:41:19,146
You're rushing into it because
you're afraid you'll change your mind.

524
00:41:19,217 --> 00:41:20,809
No, I'm not.

525
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,017
I know what I want.

526
00:41:25,457 --> 00:41:28,483
You wouldn't have to change for me, Bella,

527
00:41:29,194 --> 00:41:31,389
or say goodbye to anybody.

528
00:41:32,464 --> 00:41:35,024
I can give you more than him.

529
00:41:36,034 --> 00:41:40,266
I mean, he probably can't even kiss you
without hurting you.

530
00:41:41,706 --> 00:41:43,071
Feel that?

531
00:41:44,075 --> 00:41:46,305
Flesh and blood.

532
00:41:46,945 --> 00:41:48,674
And warmth.

533
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:01,618
God!

534
00:42:03,295 --> 00:42:04,523
God!

535
00:42:12,371 --> 00:42:13,395
Edward!

536
00:42:13,472 --> 00:42:15,736
If you ever touch her
against her will again...

537
00:42:15,808 --> 00:42:17,799
Don't do this here!
She's not sure what she wants.

538
00:42:17,877 --> 00:42:19,310
Don't do this here!
Let me give you a clue.

539
00:42:19,378 --> 00:42:20,777
Wait for her to say the words.

540
00:42:20,846 --> 00:42:23,110
Fine! And she will.

541
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:24,881
Jacob, just go, okay?

542
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,680
Hey, hey, hey! Easy, guys. Easy.

543
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,749
Let's take it down a notch. All right?

544
00:42:33,993 --> 00:42:35,085
What's going on?

545
00:42:38,998 --> 00:42:39,987
I kissed Bella.

546
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,036
And she broke her hand.

547
00:42:48,307 --> 00:42:49,501
Punching my face.

548
00:42:51,745 --> 00:42:53,110
Total misunderstanding.

549
00:42:55,749 --> 00:42:57,148
It's just a sprain.

550
00:42:57,317 --> 00:42:59,478
It should heal fairly quickly.

551
00:43:00,987 --> 00:43:04,423
Trying to walk and chew gum
at the same time again, Bella?

552
00:43:05,258 --> 00:43:06,748
I punched a werewolf in the face.

553
00:43:06,927 --> 00:43:10,522
Badass.
You're gonna be one tough little newborn.

554
00:43:11,665 --> 00:43:13,428
Tough enough to take you on.

555
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:21,172
Don't worry about it.

556
00:43:24,444 --> 00:43:26,036
Got any leads?

557
00:43:26,413 --> 00:43:30,747
No sign of the intruder. But Victoria
continues to make appearances.

558
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:40,851
Go blather to someone else
about the joys of becoming a newborn.

559
00:43:45,399 --> 00:43:46,627
Okay...

560
00:43:47,702 --> 00:43:49,135
Rosalie,

561
00:43:51,272 --> 00:43:53,968
I don't understand what I did
to make you hate me so much.

562
00:43:54,308 --> 00:43:55,366
Hate...

563
00:43:57,445 --> 00:43:58,605
I don't hate you.

564
00:44:01,782 --> 00:44:04,649
I don't particularly like you, but...

565
00:44:09,223 --> 00:44:11,316
Bella, I envy you.

566
00:44:12,326 --> 00:44:13,588
What?

567
00:44:14,896 --> 00:44:17,194
That's ridiculous.
No, it's not.

568
00:44:19,433 --> 00:44:20,900
You have a choice.

569
00:44:21,168 --> 00:44:22,635
I didn't.

570
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:27,200
None of us did.
But you do, and you're choosing wrong.

571
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:31,211
I don't care
how miserable your human life is.

572
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,708
My life is not miserable.

573
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:41,151
I mean, it's not perfect.
Nobody's life is perfect.

574
00:44:41,623 --> 00:44:43,022
Mine was.

575
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:45,625
Absolutely perfect.

576
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:49,261
There were things I still wanted,

577
00:44:50,465 --> 00:44:51,955
to be married, with a nice house

578
00:44:52,034 --> 00:44:54,229
and a husband to kiss me
when he came home,

579
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:56,729
a family of my own.

580
00:44:57,673 --> 00:45:01,040
Royce King was the most eligible bachelor
in town.

581
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,975
I barely knew him.

582
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:12,209
But I was young.
I was in love with the idea of love.

583
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:17,247
On the last night of my life,
I left a friend's house late.

584
00:45:17,326 --> 00:45:18,817
I wasn't far from home.

585
00:45:18,895 --> 00:45:20,590
There she is.

586
00:45:20,663 --> 00:45:21,687
Hey, Rose!

587
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:25,065
Come over here! Here. Hold this.

588
00:45:25,935 --> 00:45:27,596
Hey, come over here.

589
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:30,369
We've been waiting for you.

590
00:45:31,274 --> 00:45:32,935
There she is.

591
00:45:34,344 --> 00:45:36,039
Royce. Royce!

592
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,243
You're drunk.

593
00:45:39,315 --> 00:45:42,807
Isn't she lovely, John?
I told you she was a looker.

594
00:45:42,885 --> 00:45:45,410
It's hard to say with all those clothes on.

595
00:45:45,822 --> 00:45:47,016
What do you say, Rose?

596
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:49,524
Why don't we take off a few layers?
Stop it, stop it.

597
00:45:49,993 --> 00:45:51,961
Stop. Stop!

598
00:45:54,464 --> 00:45:55,795
I'll see you tomorrow.

599
00:45:55,865 --> 00:45:57,196
Sober.

600
00:45:58,735 --> 00:46:00,100
Hey, where do you think you're going?

601
00:46:00,169 --> 00:46:02,569
I said, get... Come back... Hey!
Stop! Stop! Get off me!

602
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:04,606
You'll do as I say!
Let go of me! Stop!

603
00:46:04,674 --> 00:46:07,007
Stop! Let go! Stop!

604
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:12,739
They left me in the street,
thinking I was dead.

605
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,050
Believe me, I wanted to be.

606
00:46:16,754 --> 00:46:18,881
Carlisle found me. He smelled all the blood.

607
00:46:19,356 --> 00:46:22,154
Thought he was helping me.
I'm sorry.

608
00:46:24,928 --> 00:46:27,226
I got my revenge on them.

609
00:46:28,732 --> 00:46:30,393
One at a time.

610
00:46:30,801 --> 00:46:33,565
Saved Royce for last,
so he'd know I was coming.

611
00:46:52,156 --> 00:46:54,522
I was a little theatrical back then.

612
00:47:03,401 --> 00:47:06,302
Things got better after I found Emmett.

613
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,901
But we'll always be this.

614
00:47:14,612 --> 00:47:15,806
Frozen.

615
00:47:16,948 --> 00:47:18,472
Never moving forward.

616
00:47:20,351 --> 00:47:23,946
That's what I miss the most. Possibilities.

617
00:47:25,323 --> 00:47:27,848
Sitting on a front porch somewhere,

618
00:47:28,093 --> 00:47:30,721
Emmett, gray-haired, by my side,

619
00:47:30,795 --> 00:47:33,423
surrounded by our grandchildren.

620
00:47:34,732 --> 00:47:36,461
Their laughter.

621
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:41,371
I understand that that's what you want.

622
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,181
But there's nothing
I'm ever gonna want more

623
00:47:53,919 --> 00:47:55,511
than Edward.

624
00:47:56,255 --> 00:47:58,189
You're wrong again.

625
00:48:00,025 --> 00:48:03,927
After you've been changed,
there's one thing you'll want more,

626
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:05,761
one thing you'll kill for.

627
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:10,032
Blood.

628
00:48:15,808 --> 00:48:18,971
What did I say about a low profile?

629
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,290
Something's coming.

630
00:48:35,395 --> 00:48:39,491
Something bigger than any of us alone.

631
00:48:40,934 --> 00:48:45,496
And if you can't control yourselves,

632
00:48:48,308 --> 00:48:50,401
we're all going to die.

633
00:48:54,714 --> 00:48:57,012
What's done is done, just

634
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:01,985
clean up after yourselves.

635
00:49:10,664 --> 00:49:13,690
They've already drawn too much attention.

636
00:49:13,767 --> 00:49:15,098
So has our inaction.

637
00:49:16,136 --> 00:49:19,799
Others may begin to question
the Volturi's effectiveness.

638
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,207
Let them.

639
00:49:27,748 --> 00:49:29,909
Maybe we should consult with Aro.

640
00:49:34,989 --> 00:49:37,253
Aro's decisions are being watched.

641
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,056
We must decide.

642
00:49:43,497 --> 00:49:46,694
Then decide, sister. It's time.

643
00:49:48,669 --> 00:49:50,432
Yes, it is.

644
00:49:55,343 --> 00:49:58,141
Either we let them do
what they were created for,

645
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:01,010
or we end them.

646
00:50:01,949 --> 00:50:03,917
Decisions, decisions.

647
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:18,729
When we were five, they asked us
what we wanted to be when we grew up.

648
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,896
Our answers were things
like astronaut, president,

649
00:50:23,538 --> 00:50:26,234
or, in my case, a princess.</font>

650
00:50:26,308 --> 00:50:28,936
When we were 10, they asked again.

651
00:50:29,011 --> 00:50:33,880
We answered rock star, cowboy
or, in my case, a gold medalist.

652
00:50:34,883 --> 00:50:38,614
But now that we've grown up,
they want a serious answer.

653
00:50:39,187 --> 00:50:41,178
Well, how about this?

654
00:50:41,957 --> 00:50:43,481
Who the hell knows?

655
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,920
Yeah!

656
00:50:47,763 --> 00:50:49,958
This isn't the time to make
hard-and-fast decisions.

657
00:50:50,032 --> 00:50:51,693
This is the time to make mistakes.

658
00:50:52,734 --> 00:50:55,703
Take the wrong train
and get stuck somewhere.

659
00:50:55,771 --> 00:50:58,433
Fall in love a lot.

660
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:04,040
Major in philosophy, because there's
no way to make a career out of that.

661
00:51:04,113 --> 00:51:07,947
Change your mind, and change it again,
because nothing's permanent.

662
00:51:09,118 --> 00:51:11,678
So make as many mistakes as you can.

663
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:14,851
That way, someday,
when they ask what we want to be,

664
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:16,690
we won't have to guess.

665
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:19,753
We'll know.

666
00:51:47,323 --> 00:51:48,620
You made it!

667
00:51:49,093 --> 00:51:51,584
Hey. What did you think of my speech?

668
00:51:51,662 --> 00:51:54,631
Too easy-breezy? Too self-helpful?
You hated it?

669
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:57,292
No. I think you pretty much nailed it.
Yeah?

670
00:51:57,601 --> 00:51:59,899
It's like I was born to lead, right?

671
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:01,733
I love this song! Let's go.

672
00:52:26,663 --> 00:52:27,994
What are you doing here?

673
00:52:28,465 --> 00:52:30,330
You invited me, remember?

674
00:52:31,101 --> 00:52:35,037
Was my right hook too subtle for you?
That was me uninviting you.

675
00:52:35,873 --> 00:52:39,435
Look, Bella, I'm sorry about, you know,

676
00:52:40,979 --> 00:52:43,447
the kiss and your hand.

677
00:52:44,349 --> 00:52:48,479
I'd blame it on the whole inner animal thing,
but it was really just me

678
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,815
being an ass.

679
00:52:51,589 --> 00:52:53,022
I'm really sorry.

680
00:52:54,659 --> 00:52:56,490
I brought you something.

681
00:52:56,795 --> 00:53:00,060
A graduation present. I made it myself.

682
00:53:00,965 --> 00:53:02,398
Wow.

683
00:53:02,867 --> 00:53:04,164
You made this?

684
00:53:05,136 --> 00:53:06,728
It's really pretty.

685
00:53:07,005 --> 00:53:08,404
Thanks.

686
00:53:23,154 --> 00:53:24,212
I'll be right back.

687
00:53:27,293 --> 00:53:30,490
Alice, what'd you see?
The decision's been made.

688
00:53:30,563 --> 00:53:32,121
What's going on?

689
00:53:32,198 --> 00:53:34,689
You're not going to Seattle.
No.

690
00:53:35,868 --> 00:53:37,768
They're coming here.

691
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:39,962
They'll be here in four days.

692
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:41,939
This could turn into a bloodbath.

693
00:53:42,107 --> 00:53:43,131
Who's behind it?

694
00:53:43,209 --> 00:53:45,677
I didn't see anyone I recognized.

695
00:53:46,278 --> 00:53:47,267
Maybe one.

696
00:53:48,447 --> 00:53:51,848
I know his face. He's local. Riley Biers.

697
00:53:52,685 --> 00:53:53,709
He didn't start this.

698
00:53:53,786 --> 00:53:55,777
Whoever did is staying out of the action.

699
00:53:56,121 --> 00:53:58,487
They must be playing with the blind spots
in your vision.

700
00:53:58,557 --> 00:54:00,525
Either way, the army is coming

701
00:54:00,593 --> 00:54:02,220
and there aren't enough of us
to protect the town.

702
00:54:02,294 --> 00:54:05,195
Hold up. What damn army?

703
00:54:05,264 --> 00:54:07,232
Newborns. Our kind.

704
00:54:07,466 --> 00:54:08,592
What are they after?

705
00:54:08,834 --> 00:54:10,734
They were passing around Bella's scent.

706
00:54:11,136 --> 00:54:12,433
A red blouse.

707
00:54:12,505 --> 00:54:15,873
They're after Bella?
What the hell does this mean?

708
00:54:15,942 --> 00:54:18,843
It means an ugly fight. With lives lost.

709
00:54:23,984 --> 00:54:26,179
All right. We're in.

710
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,680
No. You'd get yourselves killed. No way.

711
00:54:30,223 --> 00:54:32,487
I wasn't asking for permission.

712
00:54:33,093 --> 00:54:34,492
Edward?

713
00:54:38,331 --> 00:54:39,821
It means more protection for you.

714
00:54:41,234 --> 00:54:45,898
Jacob, do you believe
Sam would agree to an understanding?

715
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:50,269
As long as we get to kill some vampires.

716
00:54:50,343 --> 00:54:51,367
Jasper?

717
00:54:51,444 --> 00:54:53,469
They'll give us the numbers.

718
00:54:54,681 --> 00:54:58,674
Newborns won't know they even exist.
That'll give us an edge.

719
00:54:58,752 --> 00:55:00,185
We'll need to coordinate.

720
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:04,087
Carlisle, they're gonna get hurt.
We'll all need some training.

721
00:55:04,157 --> 00:55:07,127
Fighting newborns requires knowledge
that Jasper has.

722
00:55:07,194 --> 00:55:09,287
You're welcome to join us.

723
00:55:10,631 --> 00:55:13,725
All right. Name the time and place.

724
00:55:13,801 --> 00:55:17,635
Jake, you don't know
what you're getting yourself into.

725
00:55:19,073 --> 00:55:20,438
Bella,

726
00:55:21,042 --> 00:55:22,942
this is what we do.

727
00:55:23,477 --> 00:55:24,808
You should be happy.

728
00:55:25,446 --> 00:55:28,108
Look at us, working together.

729
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:32,110
You are the one who wanted us
to get along. Remember?

730
00:55:41,662 --> 00:55:42,890
Again!

731
00:55:56,011 --> 00:55:58,206
It's a graduation present.

732
00:56:17,366 --> 00:56:20,164
They don't trust us enough
to be in their human forms.

733
00:56:20,235 --> 00:56:22,362
They came. That's what matters.

734
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:25,402
Will you translate?

735
00:56:30,445 --> 00:56:31,742
Hey, Jake.

736
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,252
Welcome.

737
00:56:41,456 --> 00:56:45,257
Jasper has experience with newborns.
He'll teach us how to defeat them.

738
00:56:48,698 --> 00:56:50,359
They want to know
how the newborns differ from us.

739
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:53,460
They're a great deal stronger than us

740
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:56,403
because their own human blood
lingers in their tissues.

741
00:56:57,173 --> 00:57:00,267
Our kind is never more physically powerful

742
00:57:00,743 --> 00:57:02,938
than in our first several months of this life.

743
00:57:06,482 --> 00:57:10,282
Carlisle's right. That's why they are created.

744
00:57:11,654 --> 00:57:15,556
A newborn army doesn't need thousands
like a human army,

745
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:18,753
but no human army
could stand against them.

746
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:23,490
Now, the two most important things
to remember are, first,

747
00:57:23,566 --> 00:57:27,002
never let them get their arms around you.
They'll crush you instantly.

748
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,628
And second,

749
00:57:29,872 --> 00:57:32,637
never go for the obvious kill.

750
00:57:34,144 --> 00:57:36,374
They'll be expecting that,

751
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,244
and you will lose.

752
00:57:40,818 --> 00:57:42,046
Emmett.

753
00:57:44,221 --> 00:57:47,520
Even if they stick to humming

754
00:57:47,591 --> 00:57:49,115
Holding on a song to see them

755
00:57:49,193 --> 00:57:51,923
Don't hold back.
Not in my nature.

756
00:57:51,995 --> 00:57:54,020
Sick of, sick of, sick of love

757
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:02,469
When you went down, the men came callin'

758
00:58:02,539 --> 00:58:06,771
Changing to stone as you wept from fallin'

759
00:58:06,844 --> 00:58:08,505
Never lose focus.

760
00:58:15,385 --> 00:58:19,219
When you went down, the men came callin'

761
00:58:21,426 --> 00:58:25,487
Changing to stone as you wept from fallin'

762
00:58:29,534 --> 00:58:30,865
One more thing.

763
00:58:31,736 --> 00:58:34,296
Never turn your back on your enemy.

764
00:58:34,372 --> 00:58:38,103
Singing in tones that makes things summer

765
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:48,978
I got the skills

766
00:58:49,053 --> 00:58:54,548
I'm in love with you

767
00:58:54,626 --> 00:58:58,528
Everything you taught me, honey

768
00:58:58,596 --> 00:59:00,723
It never even mattered really

769
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:06,965
This song's about my love for you

770
00:59:21,587 --> 00:59:23,919
Some of you are gonna get hurt.

771
00:59:26,592 --> 00:59:29,720
Some of you could get killed
because of me.

772
00:59:33,132 --> 00:59:35,930
It's gonna be 100 times worse
than this, right?

773
00:59:58,592 --> 01:00:00,059
Done for the day.

774
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,537
Jasper?

775
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:20,609
Are you sure
there's nothing I can do to help?

776
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:24,207
Well, your presence alone, your scent,
will distract the newborns.

777
01:00:24,284 --> 01:00:28,311
Their hunting instinct will take over
and drive them crazy.

778
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,916
Good. I'm glad.

779
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:37,427
Hey. How do you know so much about this?

780
01:00:39,432 --> 01:00:43,493
I didn't have quite the same upbringing
as my adopted siblings.

781
01:00:49,877 --> 01:00:53,142
Those bites are like mine.
Battle scars.

782
01:00:55,483 --> 01:00:58,145
All the training
the Confederate Army gave me

783
01:00:58,219 --> 01:01:00,687
was useless against the newborns.

784
01:01:01,455 --> 01:01:04,288
Still, I never lost a fight.

785
01:01:10,197 --> 01:01:13,223
This happened during the Civil War?

786
01:01:13,301 --> 01:01:16,031
I was the youngest major
in the Texas cavalry,

787
01:01:16,103 --> 01:01:18,799
all without having seen any real battle.

788
01:01:18,873 --> 01:01:20,033
Until?

789
01:01:22,043 --> 01:01:23,908
Till I met a certain immortal.

790
01:01:24,845 --> 01:01:26,312
Maria.

791
01:01:31,152 --> 01:01:32,449
I was riding back to Galveston

792
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,148
after evacuating a column
of women and children

793
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:37,185
when I saw them.

794
01:01:38,393 --> 01:01:40,156
I immediately offered them my aid.

795
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,638
Lovely. And an officer.

796
01:01:58,213 --> 01:02:02,843
You'd better do it, Maria.
I can never stop once I've started.

797
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:10,119
What's your name, soldier?
Major Jasper Whitlock, ma'am.

798
01:02:11,093 --> 01:02:12,856
I hope you survive.

799
01:02:13,962 --> 01:02:16,590
You may be of great use to me.

800
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:23,901
Maria was creating an army?
They were very common in the South.

801
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:29,472
There were constant brutal battles
for territory.

802
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:31,842
Maria won them all.

803
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:37,679
She was smart, careful, and she had me.

804
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:42,754
I was her second in command.

805
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:46,318
My ability to control emotions
served her well.

806
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:49,598
I trained her newborns,

807
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:57,765
an endless occupation since she never
let them live beyond their first year.

808
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:03,011
It was my job to dispose of them.

809
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,034
I could feel everything they felt.

810
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:41,746
I thought what Maria and I had was love.

811
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:46,884
But I was her puppet.
She pulled the strings.

812
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:50,960
I didn't know there was another way

813
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:55,160
till I found Alice.

814
01:03:56,967 --> 01:03:59,299
Now, she'd seen me coming, of course.

815
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:01,863
You kept me waiting long enough.

816
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:07,505
My apologies, ma'am.

817
01:04:09,514 --> 01:04:11,812
I don't know what I'd have become
without her.

818
01:04:14,252 --> 01:04:16,652
You never have to be that again.

819
01:04:44,616 --> 01:04:45,674
Jasper.

820
01:04:47,051 --> 01:04:49,019
I want you to do something for me.

821
01:04:49,087 --> 01:04:51,386
Kill her.

822
01:05:05,871 --> 01:05:06,997
What is it?

823
01:05:10,643 --> 01:05:12,167
The intruder,

824
01:05:13,812 --> 01:05:15,473
the newborn army,

825
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:20,048
they're all her puppets.

826
01:05:22,188 --> 01:05:23,416
Victoria.

827
01:05:24,623 --> 01:05:27,888
Alice would have seen
if she wanted to make an army.

828
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,761
Unless she's hiding behind them
and she's letting someone else decide.

829
01:06:02,028 --> 01:06:03,893
Welcome to the army.

830
01:06:13,173 --> 01:06:16,870
I'm not just gonna hide
while you're out taking all the risks for me.

831
01:06:17,677 --> 01:06:21,078
If it's Victoria involved, I need to keep you
as far away from the fight as possible.

832
01:06:21,147 --> 01:06:24,605
Jasper said that I could be of help.
We won't need your help.

833
01:06:24,684 --> 01:06:27,517
With the wolves in this, it's an easy win.

834
01:06:27,587 --> 01:06:30,216
The rest of us
aren't gonna have enough to do.

835
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:32,657
Okay.
Either it's so dangerous that I have to hide

836
01:06:32,727 --> 01:06:34,752
or it's so easy
that you're gonna be sidelined. Which is it?

837
01:06:34,829 --> 01:06:37,320
It's dangerous for you, it's easy for us.

838
01:06:39,267 --> 01:06:43,931
I think it's dangerous for us to be apart.
How many times do we have to prove that?

839
01:06:44,972 --> 01:06:49,705
I'll be worried. You'll be worried.
And we'll both be more vulnerable.

840
01:06:52,313 --> 01:06:54,042
Okay, you're right.

841
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:58,310
So I'm coming with you.
No, we both stay away together.

842
01:06:58,753 --> 01:07:01,620
I can't make you choose
between me and your family.

843
01:07:01,689 --> 01:07:04,715
The only way I can protect you
is to be with you.

844
01:07:08,929 --> 01:07:12,990
You're not fighting?
What, did you pull a muscle or something?

845
01:07:13,067 --> 01:07:15,467
He's doing it for me, okay?
Whatever.

846
01:07:16,837 --> 01:07:18,066
Just tell me the plan.

847
01:07:19,007 --> 01:07:20,975
This field will give us
an advantage in battle.

848
01:07:21,043 --> 01:07:23,841
We need to lure the newborns
with Bella's scent,

849
01:07:24,579 --> 01:07:26,342
but it needs to end here.

850
01:07:26,415 --> 01:07:28,042
Edward and I are going to a campsite.

851
01:07:28,116 --> 01:07:31,449
Even if he carries me,
they'll still pick up on our scents.

852
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,488
Your stench, however, is revolting.

853
01:07:33,555 --> 01:07:35,682
Dude, you really
don't wanna start comparing stinks.

854
01:07:35,757 --> 01:07:39,352
What he means is that your scent
will mask mine if you carry me.

855
01:07:40,228 --> 01:07:43,254
Done.
This is not a good idea.

856
01:07:43,332 --> 01:07:48,326
Edward, they won't want
to get anywhere near his odor.

857
01:07:48,603 --> 01:07:50,594
Okay. Let's just try it.

858
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:55,741
Eau de wolf coming up.
Run.

859
01:08:06,054 --> 01:08:08,615
So you gonna ask me
to sit out of the fight, too?

860
01:08:08,691 --> 01:08:10,818
Or don't you care about my safety?

861
01:08:11,294 --> 01:08:16,732
Of course, I care. But you'd say no.
I won't have a choice, anyways.

862
01:08:17,967 --> 01:08:22,267
Since I let Sam be alpha male,
I gotta live with the shots he calls.

863
01:08:23,506 --> 01:08:25,406
Since you let Sam be alpha?

864
01:08:26,676 --> 01:08:30,476
I didn't wanna be in a pack,
let alone be its leader.

865
01:08:32,348 --> 01:08:33,440
Wow.

866
01:08:34,951 --> 01:08:37,920
Chief Jacob.
Opted out.

867
01:08:39,055 --> 01:08:41,353
But every choice has its consequences.

868
01:08:41,924 --> 01:08:44,484
Some more than others.
Don't start.

869
01:08:44,994 --> 01:08:47,963
Everybody makes choices.
You're gonna have to accept mine.

870
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:51,431
But you can love
more than one person at a time.

871
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:55,130
I've seen it. With Sam, Emily and Leah.

872
01:08:56,673 --> 01:09:01,610
Well, I'm not a wolf. I can't imprint.
It has nothing to do with imprinting.

873
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:06,409
It has to do with feeling something
for somebody.

874
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:09,678
And I know you feel something for me.

875
01:09:10,888 --> 01:09:14,016
I can sense how I make you feel, physically.

876
01:09:15,893 --> 01:09:17,656
I make you nervous.

877
01:09:21,965 --> 01:09:23,193
Jake.

878
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:26,702
Don't worry.

879
01:09:27,638 --> 01:09:31,005
I promised I wouldn't kiss you again
till you asked.

880
01:09:31,642 --> 01:09:35,237
You're gonna be keeping that promise
for a while, chief.

881
01:09:38,248 --> 01:09:41,775
All I picked up was wolf stench. No Bella.

882
01:09:45,023 --> 01:09:47,457
This will work.
Great.

883
01:09:55,533 --> 01:09:57,228
Yes. Scout's honor.

884
01:09:58,002 --> 01:10:00,903
Okay, Alice, don't be a stranger.
Okay.

885
01:10:02,607 --> 01:10:05,599
Your alibi for the battle is all arranged.
Really?

886
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,806
I told your father that our whole family's
going camping this weekend,

887
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,314
so you and I are having a sleepover
at my house.

888
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:15,417
Charlie's going fishing, anyway.
Charlie?

889
01:10:15,954 --> 01:10:19,390
You guys are on first name basis now?
Me, he likes.

890
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:24,190
Actually, you and Edward
will have the house to yourself tonight.

891
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:28,823
Like alone?

892
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:33,094
We're all going hunting.
Powering up for the battle.

893
01:10:35,841 --> 01:10:36,933
You're welcome.

894
01:10:39,144 --> 01:10:42,910
Hey. You want a sandwich?
No, I'm good.

895
01:10:44,984 --> 01:10:46,975
Well, the sister, I like.

896
01:10:48,153 --> 01:10:51,054
Alice. Yeah, she's great.

897
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:00,999
Hey, Dad, I was wondering.

898
01:11:02,535 --> 01:11:05,595
Why didn't you get remarried? After Mom.

899
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:14,775
I don't know.
Guess I still haven't met the right gal.

900
01:11:17,182 --> 01:11:19,275
Why?
I don't know.

901
01:11:22,589 --> 01:11:26,616
I thought you just maybe gave up
on the whole institution of it,

902
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:29,194
of marriage.

903
01:11:30,997 --> 01:11:32,624
But do you think there's any value in it?

904
01:11:34,901 --> 01:11:37,927
Yeah. Yeah, marriage has value.

905
01:11:40,006 --> 01:11:41,598
When you're older.

906
01:11:42,609 --> 01:11:43,871
Much older.

907
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:47,671
Like your mother.

908
01:11:48,081 --> 01:11:50,481
It seemed to work out fine for her
the second time around,

909
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:53,451
later in life.
Yeah, I guess.

910
01:11:56,056 --> 01:12:00,390
I mean, you definitely don't wanna
have to get married because you weren't

911
01:12:01,461 --> 01:12:02,860
careful.

912
01:12:04,831 --> 01:12:08,267
What?
Look, you know what I'm talking about.

913
01:12:09,669 --> 01:12:12,901
There's things you need to think about
if you're gonna be physically intimate.

914
01:12:12,974 --> 01:12:15,568
Okay. Don't have "the talk" with me, please.

915
01:12:15,643 --> 01:12:18,203
Well, it's just as embarrassing for me
as it is for you.

916
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:19,644
I doubt that.

917
01:12:19,714 --> 01:12:22,148
And don't bother,
'cause Mom beat you to it like 10 years ago.

918
01:12:22,216 --> 01:12:24,116
Well, you didn't have a boyfriend
10 years ago.

919
01:12:24,185 --> 01:12:26,585
I'm sure things work the same way.

920
01:12:28,923 --> 01:12:30,618
All right, so...

921
01:12:32,526 --> 01:12:34,960
You guys are taking precautions and...

922
01:12:35,029 --> 01:12:37,998
Okay, Dad, please,
just don't worry about that.

923
01:12:39,066 --> 01:12:42,092
Edward is old school.

924
01:12:44,438 --> 01:12:48,033
Old school. Great. What's that?
Like, code for something?

925
01:12:48,109 --> 01:12:50,771
Oh, my God. Dad. I'm a virgin.

926
01:12:51,779 --> 01:12:55,340
Okay! Good. Glad we covered that.
Me, too.

927
01:12:59,888 --> 01:13:01,219
Virgin.

928
01:13:02,824 --> 01:13:05,122
I'm liking Edward a little bit more now.

929
01:13:16,004 --> 01:13:18,234
What are you doing outside?
What's wrong?

930
01:13:19,508 --> 01:13:20,736
Nothing.

931
01:13:40,529 --> 01:13:43,327
It seems only fair
that I be represented, as well.

932
01:13:47,936 --> 01:13:49,768
It's really pretty.

933
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:52,031
Thanks.

934
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:01,906
There's a bed.

935
01:14:03,219 --> 01:14:05,653
I thought you might need one to sleep in.

936
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:10,584
I think an air mattress would have sufficed.

937
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:13,561
Is this too much?
No.

938
01:14:14,731 --> 01:14:16,426
No, it's perfect.

939
01:14:18,034 --> 01:14:21,470
I wanna ask you something.
Anything.

940
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:29,041
Okay, marriage is the condition for you
to change me yourself, right?

941
01:14:31,948 --> 01:14:33,040
Yes.

942
01:14:36,018 --> 01:14:39,079
Okay. I wanna negotiate my own condition.

943
01:14:41,191 --> 01:14:43,523
Anything you want. It's yours.

944
01:14:45,562 --> 01:14:47,189
You promise?

945
01:14:48,632 --> 01:14:49,826
Yeah.

946
01:14:53,837 --> 01:14:55,168
Okay.

947
01:15:01,712 --> 01:15:02,770
Hey.

948
01:15:11,588 --> 01:15:12,885
Bella.

949
01:15:13,957 --> 01:15:15,151
No.

950
01:15:15,225 --> 01:15:17,523
But you said that you wanted me
to have every human experience.

951
01:15:17,594 --> 01:15:20,757
Not ones that will risk killing you.
You won't.

952
01:15:22,966 --> 01:15:26,060
And everyone says once I'm changed
all I'll want is to slaughter the whole town.

953
01:15:27,438 --> 01:15:30,532
That part doesn't last forever.
I want you.

954
01:15:32,944 --> 01:15:37,176
While I'm still me.
While I still want you this way.

955
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,914
It's too dangerous.
Try. Just try.

956
01:15:49,794 --> 01:15:54,197
I'll go to some ridiculously expensive
college and let you buy me a car.

957
01:15:54,265 --> 01:15:56,495
I'll marry you. Just try.

958
01:15:59,804 --> 01:16:02,705
You were searching

959
01:16:03,608 --> 01:16:07,442
For release

960
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:11,582
You took my hand

961
01:16:11,983 --> 01:16:15,647
Added a plan

962
01:16:15,721 --> 01:16:19,885
You gave me your heart

963
01:16:26,799 --> 01:16:33,728
I know you're pleased to go

964
01:16:37,877 --> 01:16:40,368
Stop trying to take your clothes off.

965
01:16:40,446 --> 01:16:43,108
You wanna do that part?
Not tonight.

966
01:17:03,502 --> 01:17:04,663
You...

967
01:17:08,174 --> 01:17:10,108
You mean, you don't...

968
01:17:12,078 --> 01:17:13,170
That's fine.

969
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:18,710
Believe me, I want to.

970
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:22,821
I just want to be married to you first.

971
01:17:26,192 --> 01:17:28,490
You really make me feel
like I'm some sort of villain

972
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:31,655
trying to steal your virtue or something.

973
01:17:34,067 --> 01:17:36,262
It's not my virtue I'm concerned about.

974
01:17:38,672 --> 01:17:40,333
Are you kidding?

975
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:44,934
It's just one rule I wanna leave unbroken.

976
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:51,011
It might be too late for my soul,
but I will protect yours.

977
01:17:52,185 --> 01:17:54,882
I know that's not a modern notion.

978
01:17:54,956 --> 01:17:58,119
It's not modern. It's ancient.

979
01:18:01,228 --> 01:18:03,287
I'm from a different era.

980
01:18:05,633 --> 01:18:09,160
Things were a lot less complicated.

981
01:18:11,405 --> 01:18:15,865
And if I'd have met you back then,
I would have courted you.

982
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:23,244
We'd have taken chaperoned strolls
and iced tea on the porch.

983
01:18:34,061 --> 01:18:36,427
I may have stolen a kiss or two,

984
01:18:37,531 --> 01:18:42,469
but only after asking
your father's permission.

985
01:18:44,773 --> 01:18:46,331
I would have got down on one knee,

986
01:18:53,215 --> 01:18:56,184
and I would have
presented you with a ring.

987
01:19:03,258 --> 01:19:04,350
This was my mother's.

988
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:13,590
Isabella Swan, I promise to love you
every moment of forever.

989
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:18,433
And would you do me
the extraordinary honor of marrying me?

990
01:19:24,312 --> 01:19:25,677
Yes.

991
01:19:47,537 --> 01:19:49,630
You're not coming with us?

992
01:19:58,214 --> 01:20:00,705
It'll be a last minute decision.

993
01:20:02,718 --> 01:20:07,951
I told you how it works.
The Cullens have powers.

994
01:20:09,158 --> 01:20:13,857
Don't underestimate them, Riley.
You'll have the numbers,

995
01:20:14,831 --> 01:20:20,031
but they'll be able
to anticipate your every move.

996
01:20:21,438 --> 01:20:24,202
According to your friend?
Yes.

997
01:20:24,808 --> 01:20:27,675
My dead friend.

998
01:20:30,447 --> 01:20:33,712
Laurent found out about the things
they could do,

999
01:20:35,719 --> 01:20:37,550
and they killed him.

1000
01:20:39,423 --> 01:20:41,618
But not before he told me.

1001
01:20:46,763 --> 01:20:48,594
Maybe he was wrong.

1002
01:20:51,668 --> 01:20:58,164
I mean, this is supposed to be
Cullen territory.

1003
01:20:59,276 --> 01:21:03,212
We've been tearing it up
and I've never even seen them here.

1004
01:21:04,248 --> 01:21:06,011
You don't trust me.

1005
01:21:07,217 --> 01:21:11,746
With my life. I'm just saying...
I'm doing this for us.

1006
01:21:11,823 --> 01:21:16,886
So that we can feed
without their retaliation.

1007
01:21:16,961 --> 01:21:20,727
I can't live in fear anymore,
waiting for them to attack.

1008
01:21:20,798 --> 01:21:22,493
I won't let them.

1009
01:21:23,668 --> 01:21:28,435
I am going to end the Cullen clan.

1010
01:21:31,309 --> 01:21:32,708
I swear.

1011
01:21:49,894 --> 01:21:53,227
I love you so much.

1012
01:22:13,852 --> 01:22:15,251
You're going overboard.

1013
01:22:15,854 --> 01:22:18,414
If this is all I can contribute,
I wanna be thorough.

1014
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:20,720
The newborns'll be frantic.

1015
01:22:22,928 --> 01:22:26,329
It's okay.
Don't make yourself uncomfortable.

1016
01:22:26,398 --> 01:22:27,729
It doesn't bother me anymore.

1017
01:22:29,835 --> 01:22:31,029
Since when?

1018
01:22:31,503 --> 01:22:34,529
Since I spent 24 hours
thinking you were dead.

1019
01:22:36,175 --> 01:22:38,405
You're not wearing your ring.

1020
01:22:39,912 --> 01:22:42,278
Well, I didn't want to risk losing it.

1021
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:45,639
Or risk Jacob seeing it.

1022
01:22:48,888 --> 01:22:52,790
I think we should wait to tell him.
I mean, at least till after the fight.

1023
01:22:52,859 --> 01:22:55,487
If you're having second thoughts...
I'm not.

1024
01:22:55,562 --> 01:22:59,658
I just want him to have a clear head.
Whose head is unclear?

1025
01:23:01,201 --> 01:23:02,896
Nobody's I hope.

1026
01:23:03,903 --> 01:23:06,872
Alice says there's a storm coming.
Yeah, I can feel it.

1027
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:09,905
We should get going.

1028
01:23:11,044 --> 01:23:13,512
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

1029
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:24,256
Something up?

1030
01:23:27,193 --> 01:23:30,890
Bunch of vampires trying to kill me.
Same old same old.

1031
01:24:48,877 --> 01:24:49,969
Thank you.

1032
01:24:52,547 --> 01:24:55,607
You should get back before the storm hits.
No, I'm staying.

1033
01:24:56,351 --> 01:24:59,081
You'll need my connection to the pack
to keep tabs on what's going on.

1034
01:24:59,154 --> 01:25:02,681
You're not gonna fight?
Seth will spell me in the morning.

1035
01:25:03,058 --> 01:25:05,993
He's not happy about missing the action
but it'll keep him out of trouble.

1036
01:25:07,763 --> 01:25:09,321
Let's get you inside.

1037
01:25:27,517 --> 01:25:32,682
I should have chosen a site lower down.
No, it's fine. I'm okay.

1038
01:25:33,356 --> 01:25:34,948
What can I do?

1039
01:25:47,703 --> 01:25:51,002
I can't sleep
with all that teeth chattering going on.

1040
01:25:58,281 --> 01:26:02,514
Forget it.
She may need her toes someday.

1041
01:26:03,787 --> 01:26:07,120
And let's face it, I am hotter than you.

1042
01:26:12,196 --> 01:26:17,065
Get your hand off me.
Keep your hands off her.

1043
01:26:17,568 --> 01:26:19,058
Don't fight.

1044
01:26:22,439 --> 01:26:24,236
If she gets sick, it's on you.

1045
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:43,486
Wow, you're freezing, Bella.

1046
01:26:44,595 --> 01:26:48,053
Relax. You'll warm up soon.

1047
01:26:49,633 --> 01:26:52,194
Faster if you took your clothes off.

1048
01:26:52,270 --> 01:26:54,932
Jake.
Survival 101.

1049
01:27:26,638 --> 01:27:29,869
Can you at least attempt
to control your thoughts?

1050
01:27:32,277 --> 01:27:35,872
I really get under
that ice-cold skin of yours, don't I?

1051
01:27:38,216 --> 01:27:39,343
What?

1052
01:27:40,386 --> 01:27:43,048
Are you doubting her feelings for you?

1053
01:27:45,724 --> 01:27:46,816
Nice.

1054
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:53,296
So picking through my brain's okay,
but letting me into yours, forget it.

1055
01:27:57,303 --> 01:27:58,463
Look.

1056
01:28:00,039 --> 01:28:02,906
I know she's in love with you.
Good.

1057
01:28:03,576 --> 01:28:05,908
But she's in love with me, too.

1058
01:28:08,147 --> 01:28:10,672
She just won't admit it to herself.

1059
01:28:13,686 --> 01:28:16,120
I can't tell if you're right.

1060
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:19,114
Then let me ask you something.

1061
01:28:20,192 --> 01:28:22,922
If she chooses me...
She won't.

1062
01:28:23,495 --> 01:28:24,826
If she did,

1063
01:28:26,565 --> 01:28:27,964
would you try to kill me?

1064
01:28:29,603 --> 01:28:31,696
That's an intriguing idea.

1065
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:39,738
But, no. I couldn't hurt her like that.

1066
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,644
So you'd just turn her into
a blood-sucking demon like you?

1067
01:28:44,451 --> 01:28:47,352
I don't want that. I never wanted that.

1068
01:28:47,787 --> 01:28:50,312
So stop her.
I tried.

1069
01:28:52,125 --> 01:28:54,855
I left.
But you gave up too quickly.

1070
01:28:56,796 --> 01:29:01,699
If you'd stayed away another 6 months,
I could've made her happy.

1071
01:29:02,469 --> 01:29:03,800
Trust me.

1072
01:29:05,305 --> 01:29:10,140
You have to consider
that I might be better for her than you are.

1073
01:29:12,812 --> 01:29:14,746
I have considered that.

1074
01:29:18,452 --> 01:29:20,613
I know you can protect her.

1075
01:29:23,257 --> 01:29:28,092
But you can give her a life, a human life.
That's all I want for her.

1076
01:29:31,265 --> 01:29:32,323
But I'm not...

1077
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:36,666
I'm not going to force her into anything
ever again.

1078
01:29:39,106 --> 01:29:42,439
The last time I tried,
it almost killed us both.

1079
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:47,179
Yeah. That I remember.

1080
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:53,683
When you thought she was gone,

1081
01:29:56,023 --> 01:29:57,786
that you'd lost her,

1082
01:30:00,294 --> 01:30:03,195
how did you cope?

1083
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,997
There are no words.

1084
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:15,475
But I wouldn't wish it on anyone, Jacob.

1085
01:30:18,213 --> 01:30:21,740
This might sound odd,
but I'm glad you're here.

1086
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:23,914
Meaning,

1087
01:30:24,953 --> 01:30:27,922
"As much as I'd love to kill you,
I'm glad she's warm."

1088
01:30:31,059 --> 01:30:33,357
If we weren't natural enemies

1089
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:36,830
and you weren't trying to
steal my reason for existing,

1090
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,327
I might actually like you.

1091
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:42,666
Well,

1092
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:48,437
if you weren't planning on sucking the life
out of the girl I love,

1093
01:30:49,344 --> 01:30:50,675
I might...

1094
01:30:57,754 --> 01:31:00,814
No. Not even then.

1095
01:31:09,165 --> 01:31:12,464
But she could still change her mind,
you know.

1096
01:31:19,242 --> 01:31:20,607
Then I'd let her go.

1097
01:31:40,763 --> 01:31:42,355
Right. Hey, Seth.

1098
01:31:45,569 --> 01:31:48,504
Where's Jacob? Did he already...
Not yet.

1099
01:31:50,374 --> 01:31:54,140
He's checking to see if the woods are clear
before he goes.

1100
01:32:01,251 --> 01:32:04,812
I'm really sorry about last night.
That couldn't have been easy on you.

1101
01:32:05,255 --> 01:32:08,247
It definitely won't make my list
of top 10 favorite evenings.

1102
01:32:09,326 --> 01:32:13,456
You have a list?
All 10 I spent with you.

1103
01:32:14,898 --> 01:32:19,267
Number one is when you said
you'd marry me, Mrs. Cullen.

1104
01:32:23,106 --> 01:32:27,008
This is the 21st century.
I at least want to hyphenate my name.

1105
01:32:27,845 --> 01:32:31,303
You're marrying him?
Jake, I...

1106
01:32:35,687 --> 01:32:39,145
You knew he was listening!
He deserves to know.

1107
01:32:40,525 --> 01:32:42,083
Jake, stop!
Bella, let him...

1108
01:32:42,193 --> 01:32:43,319
Don't!

1109
01:32:46,397 --> 01:32:47,455
Jake, stop!

1110
01:32:51,135 --> 01:32:54,593
Jake, please!
I'm done! I'm so done!

1111
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,068
What can I do?

1112
01:32:57,141 --> 01:33:01,339
You can't do anything. I can,
by going out there and killing something.

1113
01:33:01,412 --> 01:33:04,006
No! You're not thinking clearly!
Don't do that!

1114
01:33:04,215 --> 01:33:06,877
Maybe I'll get myself killed
and make it simple for you.

1115
01:33:06,951 --> 01:33:09,385
No! Just, Jake, stay.

1116
01:33:11,289 --> 01:33:12,483
Why?

1117
01:33:14,359 --> 01:33:16,054
Give me one good reason.

1118
01:33:17,195 --> 01:33:19,129
Because I don't wanna lose you.

1119
01:33:20,765 --> 01:33:22,131
It's not good enough.

1120
01:33:23,535 --> 01:33:25,400
Because you're too important.

1121
01:33:28,841 --> 01:33:32,333
Still not good enough.
Jacob!

1122
01:33:36,582 --> 01:33:37,844
Kiss me.

1123
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:44,678
I'm asking you to kiss me.

1124
01:34:32,472 --> 01:34:35,100
That should have been our first kiss.

1125
01:34:40,714 --> 01:34:42,113
I gotta go.

1126
01:34:45,051 --> 01:34:46,450
I'll be back.

1127
01:35:16,684 --> 01:35:20,085
You saw.
No, but...

1128
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,851
Jacob's thoughts are pretty loud.

1129
01:35:24,392 --> 01:35:25,916
I don't know what happened.

1130
01:35:27,928 --> 01:35:29,361
You love him.

1131
01:35:33,768 --> 01:35:35,565
I love you more.

1132
01:35:37,304 --> 01:35:38,669
I know.

1133
01:35:53,355 --> 01:35:55,084
It's starting.

1134
01:36:55,017 --> 01:36:56,245
Jacob just got there.

1135
01:37:02,692 --> 01:37:04,216
He's good.

1136
01:38:02,519 --> 01:38:03,645
Someone's hurt?

1137
01:38:05,055 --> 01:38:08,081
She's close. I can hear her thoughts.

1138
01:38:08,492 --> 01:38:09,720
Seth, go.

1139
01:38:14,699 --> 01:38:17,065
She knew we weren't there,
but she caught my scent.

1140
01:38:17,535 --> 01:38:19,628
She knew you'd be with me.

1141
01:38:20,271 --> 01:38:21,738
She found us.

1142
01:38:25,343 --> 01:38:27,004
She's not alone.

1143
01:38:36,154 --> 01:38:38,952
Riley, listen to me.

1144
01:38:40,391 --> 01:38:43,451
Victoria's just using you to distract me.

1145
01:38:44,229 --> 01:38:45,696
She knows I'll kill you.

1146
01:38:49,367 --> 01:38:53,133
In fact, she'll be glad
she doesn't have to deal with you anymore.

1147
01:38:53,805 --> 01:38:58,174
Don't listen, Riley.
I told you about their mind tricks.

1148
01:38:58,243 --> 01:39:02,077
I can read her mind.
So I know what she thinks of you.

1149
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:04,242
He's lying.

1150
01:39:04,316 --> 01:39:08,980
She only created you and this army
to avenge her true mate, James.

1151
01:39:10,155 --> 01:39:13,283
That's the only thing she cares about.
Not you.

1152
01:39:15,928 --> 01:39:19,386
There's only you. You know that.

1153
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:25,463
Think about it. You're from Forks.

1154
01:39:27,373 --> 01:39:28,533
You know the area.

1155
01:39:29,642 --> 01:39:31,507
That's the only reason she chose you.

1156
01:39:33,212 --> 01:39:35,442
She doesn't love you.

1157
01:39:35,514 --> 01:39:40,508
Riley. Don't let him do this to us.

1158
01:39:42,955 --> 01:39:44,422
You know I love you.

1159
01:39:58,605 --> 01:40:00,004
You're dead.

1160
01:40:14,654 --> 01:40:17,054
You won't get another chance
like this again.

1161
01:40:21,394 --> 01:40:22,884
You want her.

1162
01:40:24,698 --> 01:40:27,929
You want me to feel the pain you felt
when I killed James,

1163
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:32,732
when I tore him to pieces,

1164
01:40:35,241 --> 01:40:37,937
when I turned him into ash,

1165
01:40:40,113 --> 01:40:44,073
when I turned him into nothing.

1166
01:42:04,199 --> 01:42:05,359
Victoria!

1167
01:42:06,802 --> 01:42:07,996
Victoria!

1168
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:10,462
Victoria!

1169
01:43:04,594 --> 01:43:07,529
Something is wrong.
Alice needs us to go.

1170
01:43:08,465 --> 01:43:09,557
Now.

1171
01:43:32,589 --> 01:43:35,649
How long?
A few minutes. Maybe 10?

1172
01:43:35,726 --> 01:43:37,091
The pack needs to leave.

1173
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:39,651
The Volturi won't honor
a truce with the werewolves.

1174
01:43:46,637 --> 01:43:47,695
Leah, don't!

1175
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:06,684
Jacob!

1176
01:44:10,061 --> 01:44:12,621
Jacob. Hold on.
Carlisle's gonna take care of you.

1177
01:44:12,697 --> 01:44:14,858
The bones on the right half of his body
are shattered.

1178
01:44:16,601 --> 01:44:18,967
Bella.
Jake, I'm right here.

1179
01:44:20,972 --> 01:44:23,236
Jacob, you idiot, I had it!
Leah!

1180
01:44:23,308 --> 01:44:25,970
I need to set the bones
before his accelerated healing kicks in.

1181
01:44:26,044 --> 01:44:28,342
It's already starting.
We need to get him out of here.

1182
01:44:28,413 --> 01:44:31,280
We're not gonna win a fight
with the Volturi.

1183
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:34,079
We'll take him back to Billy's.
I'll be there soon as I can.

1184
01:44:34,619 --> 01:44:35,677
Hang in there, Jake.

1185
01:44:46,432 --> 01:44:49,196
It's okay. We got you.
We got you.

1186
01:44:50,169 --> 01:44:51,295
They're coming.

1187
01:45:12,858 --> 01:45:14,120
Impressive.

1188
01:45:14,193 --> 01:45:18,755
I've never seen a coven escape
an assault of this magnitude intact.

1189
01:45:18,831 --> 01:45:20,389
We were lucky.

1190
01:45:21,867 --> 01:45:23,459
I doubt that.

1191
01:45:25,371 --> 01:45:28,829
It appears we missed an entertaining fight.
Yes.

1192
01:45:29,575 --> 01:45:32,237
It's not often we're rendered unnecessary.

1193
01:45:32,311 --> 01:45:35,110
If you'd arrived a half hour ago,
you would have fulfilled your purpose.

1194
01:45:36,783 --> 01:45:37,943
Pity.

1195
01:45:41,621 --> 01:45:43,179
You missed one.

1196
01:45:50,230 --> 01:45:52,664
We offered her asylum
in exchange for her surrender.

1197
01:45:53,967 --> 01:45:55,730
That wasn't yours to offer.

1198
01:45:58,872 --> 01:45:59,998
Why did you come?

1199
01:46:06,346 --> 01:46:07,574
Who created you?

1200
01:46:09,416 --> 01:46:11,976
You don't need to do that.
She'll tell you anything you want to know.

1201
01:46:12,886 --> 01:46:14,148
I know.

1202
01:46:16,256 --> 01:46:20,124
I don't know! Riley wouldn't tell us.

1203
01:46:21,227 --> 01:46:23,287
He said our thoughts weren't safe.

1204
01:46:23,364 --> 01:46:26,629
Her name was Victoria.
Perhaps you knew her.

1205
01:46:27,535 --> 01:46:30,800
Edward,
if the Volturi had knowledge of Victoria,

1206
01:46:30,871 --> 01:46:31,860
they would have stopped her.

1207
01:46:33,407 --> 01:46:34,704
Isn't that right, Jane?

1208
01:46:37,111 --> 01:46:38,601
Of course.

1209
01:46:40,081 --> 01:46:41,139
Felix.

1210
01:46:42,450 --> 01:46:43,883
She didn't know what she was doing.

1211
01:46:45,820 --> 01:46:48,152
We'll take responsibility for her.

1212
01:46:48,723 --> 01:46:50,350
Give her a chance.

1213
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:58,359
The Volturi don't give second chances.
Keep that in mind.

1214
01:46:59,633 --> 01:47:02,500
Caius will be interested to know
that she's still human.

1215
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:04,963
The date is set.

1216
01:47:07,341 --> 01:47:11,004
Take care of that, Felix. I'd like to go home.

1217
01:47:39,241 --> 01:47:40,731
Hey.</font>

1218
01:47:46,515 --> 01:47:50,007
It's been going on for a while.
Doc's re-breaking his bones.

1219
01:47:50,085 --> 01:47:51,916
Why did he have to butt in?
I could've taken that tick.

1220
01:47:51,987 --> 01:47:53,511
Give it a rest, Leah.

1221
01:48:00,095 --> 01:48:01,927
The worst is over. He'll be all right.

1222
01:48:02,965 --> 01:48:04,125
I gave him some morphine,

1223
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,532
but his body temperature
will burn it off soon.

1224
01:48:06,602 --> 01:48:08,661
I'll come back to set up a drip.

1225
01:48:09,205 --> 01:48:10,638
Thank you.

1226
01:48:20,583 --> 01:48:21,777
He's asking for you.

1227
01:48:37,099 --> 01:48:38,157
Hey, Jake.

1228
01:48:41,737 --> 01:48:42,999
Hey.

1229
01:48:55,886 --> 01:48:59,686
I was worried about you.
You were worried about me?

1230
01:49:01,458 --> 01:49:03,050
Yeah.

1231
01:49:04,061 --> 01:49:06,859
I guessed Edward would read my thoughts.

1232
01:49:09,533 --> 01:49:12,991
Was he hard on you?
He wasn't even mad at me.

1233
01:49:14,238 --> 01:49:15,398
Or you.

1234
01:49:16,907 --> 01:49:18,397
Well, damn.

1235
01:49:20,911 --> 01:49:24,870
He's better than I thought.
He's not playing a game.

1236
01:49:27,417 --> 01:49:28,679
Right.

1237
01:49:32,222 --> 01:49:33,519
Bella.

1238
01:49:36,827 --> 01:49:39,661
He's not as perfect as you think.

1239
01:49:43,201 --> 01:49:44,896
I know who he is.

1240
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,640
Can we just not talk about that?

1241
01:49:52,844 --> 01:49:55,904
I'd rather get all the re-breaking done
at once.

1242
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:04,853
Well, at least I know
I did everything I could.

1243
01:50:08,693 --> 01:50:12,026
It wasn't easy making you admit
your feelings for me.

1244
01:50:15,466 --> 01:50:18,492
I only fought them because I knew
they wouldn't change anything.

1245
01:50:26,711 --> 01:50:29,647
I'm exactly right for you, Bella.

1246
01:50:32,151 --> 01:50:36,815
It would be as easy as breathing, with me.

1247
01:50:42,828 --> 01:50:45,126
You know I love you.

1248
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:54,805
You know how much I wish it was enough.

1249
01:51:06,685 --> 01:51:07,845
Should I come back?

1250
01:51:11,056 --> 01:51:12,751
I need some time.

1251
01:51:17,464 --> 01:51:19,557
But I'll always be waiting.

1252
01:51:24,804 --> 01:51:27,602
Until my heart stops beating.

1253
01:51:29,576 --> 01:51:30,907
Maybe even then.

1254
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,300
August 13th?
Yeah. It's a month before my birthday.

1255
01:51:58,905 --> 01:52:01,999
I don't need to be
another year older than you.

1256
01:52:02,809 --> 01:52:04,606
Alice said she could get the wedding
together by then.

1257
01:52:05,713 --> 01:52:07,408
I'm sure she can.

1258
01:52:09,784 --> 01:52:11,445
There's no rush.

1259
01:52:14,021 --> 01:52:17,218
I've chosen my life. I want
to start living it.

1260
01:52:18,192 --> 01:52:21,650
And so you're gonna let Alice
plan the whole thing?

1261
01:52:21,996 --> 01:52:26,490
The dress, the reception, the guest list.

1262
01:52:26,567 --> 01:52:29,365
I mean, who knows who
she's gonna invite?

1263
01:52:31,372 --> 01:52:32,930
Does it matter?

1264
01:52:37,545 --> 01:52:39,479
I just don't know why
you're doing this.

1265
01:52:39,547 --> 01:52:42,744
What? The wedding?
No.

1266
01:52:45,719 --> 01:52:48,552
You're trying to make
everyone else happy,

1267
01:52:49,490 --> 01:52:52,050
but you're already giving
away too much.

1268
01:52:52,993 --> 01:52:54,484
You're wrong.

1269
01:53:02,504 --> 01:53:05,871
This wasn't a choice
between you and Jacob.

1270
01:53:09,711 --> 01:53:13,807
It was between who I should be
and who I am.

1271
01:53:17,519 --> 01:53:22,513
I've always felt out of step,
like literally stumbling through my life.

1272
01:53:25,694 --> 01:53:27,594
I've never felt normal.

1273
01:53:30,132 --> 01:53:32,066
Because I'm not normal.

1274
01:53:33,301 --> 01:53:34,962
I don't want to be.

1275
01:53:36,471 --> 01:53:41,704
I've had to face death
and loss and pain

1276
01:53:43,079 --> 01:53:46,242
in your world,
but I've also never felt stronger

1277
01:53:48,918 --> 01:53:52,251
and more real, more myself.

1278
01:53:54,991 --> 01:53:57,152
Because it's my world, too.

1279
01:54:00,396 --> 01:54:02,159
It's where I belong.

1280
01:54:09,005 --> 01:54:11,166
So it's not just about me?

1281
01:54:13,409 --> 01:54:16,435
No. Sorry.

1282
01:54:18,814 --> 01:54:23,877
I've made a mess trying to figure
all this out, but I wanna do it right.

1283
01:54:25,254 --> 01:54:29,657
And I wanna tie myself to you
in every way humanly possible.

1284
01:54:33,997 --> 01:54:35,555
Starting with a wedding.

1285
01:54:39,836 --> 01:54:41,235
Actually,

1286
01:54:42,139 --> 01:54:47,099
something a little more difficult first.
And maybe even dangerous.

1287
01:54:52,849 --> 01:54:54,282
We have to tell Charlie.

1288
01:54:58,455 --> 01:54:59,717
It's highly dangerous.

1289
01:55:00,791 --> 01:55:02,952
It's a good thing you're bulletproof.

1290
01:55:05,028 --> 01:55:06,552
I'm gonna need that ring.

1291
01:55:31,189 --> 01:55:33,783
All the lives

1292
01:55:35,126 --> 01:55:39,028
Always tempted to trade

1293
01:55:42,467 --> 01:55:44,958
Will they hate me

1294
01:55:45,036 --> 01:55:49,598
For all the choices I've made

1295
01:55:53,478 --> 01:55:59,417
Will they stop when they see me again?

1296
01:56:01,219 --> 01:56:06,782
I can't stop now I know who I am

1297
01:56:09,327 --> 01:56:15,324
Now I'm all yours

1298
01:56:15,401 --> 01:56:18,529
I'm not afraid

1299
01:56:18,604 --> 01:56:23,007
I'm yours always

1300
01:56:23,075 --> 01:56:26,135
Say what they may

1301
01:56:26,211 --> 01:56:29,806
And all your love

1302
01:56:29,882 --> 01:56:33,716
I'll take to a grave

1303
01:56:33,786 --> 01:56:37,313
And all my life

1304
01:56:37,389 --> 01:56:42,486
Starts now

1305
01:56:42,561 --> 01:56:44,392
Tear me down

1306
01:56:44,463 --> 01:56:49,924
They can take you out of my thoughts

1307
01:56:53,706 --> 01:56:57,608
Under every scar

1308
01:56:57,676 --> 01:57:01,613
There's a battle I've lost

1309
01:57:04,617 --> 01:57:10,385
Will they stop when they see us again?

1310
01:57:12,392 --> 01:57:18,092
I can't stop now I know who I am

1311
01:57:20,367 --> 01:57:26,567
Now I'm all yours

1312
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:30,200
I'm not afraid

1313
01:57:30,276 --> 01:57:34,178
I'm yours always

1314
01:57:34,247 --> 01:57:37,410
Say what they may

1315
01:57:37,484 --> 01:57:41,079
And all your love

1316
01:57:41,154 --> 01:57:44,954
I'll take to a grave

1317
01:57:45,024 --> 01:57:51,931
And all my life starts

1318
01:57:52,733 --> 01:57:58,330
I'm all yours

1319
01:57:58,406 --> 01:58:01,807
I'm not afraid

1320
01:58:01,876 --> 01:58:05,937
I'm yours always

1321
01:58:06,013 --> 01:58:09,312
Say what they may

1322
01:58:09,383 --> 01:58:13,046
And all your love

1323
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:16,851
I'll take to a grave

1324
01:58:16,924 --> 01:58:23,659
And all my life starts

1325
01:58:27,535 --> 01:58:30,333
Starts now

1326
01:58:43,385 --> 01:58:46,479
I was a heavy heart to carry

1327
01:58:46,555 --> 01:58:49,456
My beloved was weighed down

1328
01:58:49,524 --> 01:58:52,425
My arms around his neck

1329
01:58:52,494 --> 01:58:55,224
My fingers laced a crown

1330
01:58:55,297 --> 01:58:58,198
I was a heavy heart to carry

1331
01:58:58,266 --> 01:59:01,030
My feet dragged across the ground

1332
01:59:01,102 --> 01:59:04,037
And he took me to the river

1333
01:59:04,105 --> 01:59:07,097
Where he slowly let me drown

1334
01:59:07,175 --> 01:59:10,042
My love has concrete feet

1335
01:59:10,111 --> 01:59:13,603
My love's an iron ball

1336
01:59:13,682 --> 01:59:16,048
Wrapped around your ankles

1337
01:59:16,117 --> 01:59:20,520
Over the waterfall

1338
01:59:21,389 --> 01:59:24,790
I'm so heavy

1339
01:59:25,695 --> 01:59:27,322
Heavy

1340
01:59:27,396 --> 01:59:30,194
Heavy in your arms

1341
01:59:33,202 --> 01:59:37,696
I'm so heavy

1342
01:59:37,773 --> 01:59:39,365
Heavy

1343
01:59:39,442 --> 01:59:43,003
Heavy in your arms

1344
01:59:46,616 --> 01:59:49,676
And is it worth the wait

1345
01:59:49,752 --> 01:59:51,947
All this killing time?

1346
01:59:52,054 --> 01:59:54,921
Are you strong enough to stand

1347
01:59:54,991 --> 01:59:58,654
Protecting both your heart and mine?

1348
01:59:58,728 --> 02:00:00,923
Who is the betrayer?

1349
02:00:00,997 --> 02:00:04,694
Who's the killer in the crowd?

1350
02:00:04,767 --> 02:00:07,531
The one who creeps in corridors

1351
02:00:07,603 --> 02:00:10,071
And doesn't make a sound

1352
02:00:10,139 --> 02:00:13,040
My love has concrete feet

1353
02:00:13,109 --> 02:00:16,671
My love is an iron ball

1354
02:00:16,747 --> 02:00:19,079
Wrapped around your ankles

1355
02:00:19,149 --> 02:00:22,084
Over the waterfall

1356
02:00:22,152 --> 02:00:25,121
My love has concrete feet

1357
02:00:25,188 --> 02:00:28,646
My love's an iron ball

1358
02:00:28,725 --> 02:00:31,216
Wrapped around your ankles

1359
02:00:31,295 --> 02:00:34,787
Over the waterfall

1360
02:00:36,366 --> 02:00:40,598
I'm so heavy

1361
02:00:40,671 --> 02:00:42,263
Heavy

1362
02:00:42,339 --> 02:00:45,365
Heavy in your arms

1363
02:00:48,211 --> 02:00:52,614
I'm so heavy

1364
02:00:52,683 --> 02:00:54,275
Heavy

1365
02:00:54,351 --> 02:00:58,720
Heavy in your arms

1366
02:01:00,991 --> 02:01:04,018
I was a heavy heart to carry

1367
02:01:04,095 --> 02:01:07,496
My beloved was weighed down

1368
02:01:07,565 --> 02:01:10,261
My arms around his neck

1369
02:01:10,335 --> 02:01:13,202
My fingers laced a crown

1370
02:01:13,271 --> 02:01:15,967
I was a heavy heart to carry

1371
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:18,838
But he never let me down

1372
02:01:18,910 --> 02:01:21,845
When he held me in his arms

1373
02:01:21,913 --> 02:01:24,882
My feet never touched the ground

1374
02:01:24,949 --> 02:01:27,110
I'm so heavy

1375
02:01:29,587 --> 02:01:34,081
I'm so heavy in your arms

1376
02:01:47,939 --> 02:01:50,601
Run, run, run away

1377
02:01:50,675 --> 02:01:53,110
So lost, lost

1378
02:01:53,178 --> 02:01:54,270
Never comin'

1379
02:01:54,346 --> 02:01:58,009
Home rollin', rollin' down a track

1380
02:01:58,083 --> 02:02:01,280
No, no, I'm never comin' back

1381
02:02:01,387 --> 02:02:04,686
Hot love pumpin' in my veins

1382
02:02:04,757 --> 02:02:08,215
Our love, I hope it's not too late

1383
02:02:08,293 --> 02:02:09,988
That's the road, that's the load

1384
02:02:10,062 --> 02:02:11,086
That's the role

1385
02:02:11,163 --> 02:02:12,460
I've been down, I've been down

1386
02:02:12,531 --> 02:02:13,930
I've been down

1387
02:02:15,034 --> 02:02:17,969
What part of forever

1388
02:02:18,037 --> 02:02:20,972
Don't you understand?

1389
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:23,634
I could stay, stay, stay

1390
02:02:23,709 --> 02:02:26,769
If that's what you want, want, want

1391
02:02:26,845 --> 02:02:30,144
I'd give it to you, you, you

1392
02:02:30,215 --> 02:02:33,616
If I had a heart, heart, heart

1393
02:02:33,686 --> 02:02:36,849
And we could go, go, go

1394
02:02:36,955 --> 02:02:39,423
And never look back on now

1395
02:02:39,491 --> 02:02:42,757
I'd give it to you, you, you

1396
02:02:42,829 --> 02:02:46,663
If I had a heart

1397
02:02:50,236 --> 02:02:54,070
Imagine eternity

1398
02:02:55,942 --> 02:03:00,038
Doesn't seem that hard

1399
02:03:01,981 --> 02:03:06,782
They say nothing lasts forever

1400
02:03:09,055 --> 02:03:13,856
We'll have to prove them wrong

1401
02:03:13,927 --> 02:03:16,487
I could stay, stay, stay

1402
02:03:16,563 --> 02:03:19,589
If that's what you want, want, want

1403
02:03:19,666 --> 02:03:22,863
I'd give it to you, you, you

1404
02:03:22,969 --> 02:03:26,803
If I had a heart

1405
02:03:26,873 --> 02:03:29,570
And we could go, go, go

1406
02:03:29,643 --> 02:03:33,204
And never look back on now

1407
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:36,545
I'd give it to you, you, you

1408
02:03:36,617 --> 02:03:40,553
If I had a heart
