and respect
all the creatures...

00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,280
The birds are tweeting
at 4:00 in the morning.

167
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,912
I'm like, "Birds, we get it."

168
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,593
Stay low to the ground.

169
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
I got this.

170
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,678
MUFASA: Check the wind,
the shadows...

171
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,675
and wait for
the perfect moment to pounce.

ZAZU: The cheetahs stole
the baboons' dinner,

173
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,216
and now the baboons
are going ape.

174
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,310
Of course, as I say,
cheetahs never prosper.

175
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,515
That's what I say.

176
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,736
Do you get...
I'll say it again.

177

Hyenas in the Pride Lands.

185
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,595
They're on the hunt!

186
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,558
- Where's Sarabi?
- She's leading the charge.

187
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,039
Zazu, take Simba home.

188
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,872
Dad, let me come! I can help.

189
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,556
No, son.
You stay with the other cubs.

190
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,028
I am not a cub.

191
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,799
Come on.

192
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,673
Let's go home.

00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,708
Here we are.

I know how to hunt,

Well, let's hope we're never
attacked by a beetle.

Go back to your den, Simba.
I don't babysit.

Babysit? I'm gonna be the king
of Pride Rock.

206
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,952
My dad showed me
the whole kingdom.

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,156
Said I'm going to rule it all.

Think about it.

When I'm king,
I'll have to give you orders.

211

Tell you what to do.

How weird is that?

You've no idea.

214
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,152
So, your dad showed you
the whole kingdom?

215
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,071
Did he show you the shadows
beyond the northern borders?

216
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,358
No. He said I can't go there.
Ever.

217
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,308
And he's absolutely right.

An elephant graveyard is
no place for a young prince.

An elephant graveyard? Whoa.

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,554
Oh, dear. I've said too much.

221
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,776
Though I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later...

You've been there?

We've all been there.
And it's no place for a cub.

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,029
All those rotting bones...

and burning pools
of oozing mud.

Rotting bones?
Oozing mud?

Promise me
you'll stay away, Simba.

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,351
And remember...

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,714
it's our little secret...

We have to go.

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,432
- Where?
- Watering hole.

235
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,636
Simba, she's having her bath.

236
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,631
And it's time for yours.

But, Mom...

238
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,959
I can do it myself.

Hold still.

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,158
(SIGHS) Come on, Mom!

243
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,558
See? All clean. Can we go?

244
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,235
There's no hyenas.
You just chased them all off.

245
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,312
Just to the watering hole
and no further.

246
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,517
And stay downwind.

247
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,557
And one more little thing.

248
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,517
Zazu will be going with you.

249
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,715

250
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
SARABI: Zazu goes...

251
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,478
or you don't.

252
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,758
ZAZU: Come along. Keep up.
Let's move in a unit.

253
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,399
Okay, buddy system.

254
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,238
So, where are we really going?

255
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
How did you know?

256
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
You hate the water.

257
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,910
I heard
about this place, Nala.

258
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,558
The most incredible,
amazing...

259
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,438
Just tell me where.

260
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,398
An elephant graveyard.

261
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,671
Whoa. How far is it?

262
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,671
Not far. Just to the shadows.

263
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,717
But don't worry,
everyone's been there.

264
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,233
We've never been
that far before.

265
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,277
- What if we get lost?
- Relax, Nala.

266
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,910
I patrolled the entire kingdom
this morning with my dad.

267
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,513
There's nothing
to worry about.

268
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,557
Well, there is one thing.

269
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,200
We have an imminent threat.
Something is approaching.

270
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,271
Oh, wait, scratch that.
That's my own shadow.

271
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,312
How we getting rid
of the dodo?

272
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,118
Trust me, I got this.

273
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,633
Follow me to freedom.

274
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,917
ZAZU: Oh, how lovely it is...

275
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,277
to see the future king
with his future queen.

276
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,198
I could just molt.

277
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,992
What do you mean,
"future queen"?

278
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,993
Well, one day the two of you
will be betrothed.

279
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,958
Intended. Affianced.

280
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,194
Simba, you speak bird?

281
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,429
Married!

282
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,875
Come on.
One day you will be married.

283
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,799
To each other.

284
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,269
SIMBA: Ugh!
NALA: Ew!

285
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,240
Mmm-mmm. That's not
gonna happen, Zazu.

286
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Never ever.

287
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,594
Nala and I are friends.

288
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,916
And besides,
she's afraid of rhinos!

289
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,176
And he's never eaten
an impala.

290
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,235
I've tried it once.

291
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,753
We are never
getting married, Zazu.

292
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,672
A monarch
who ignores tradition?

293
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,592
With an attitude like that,

294
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,955
I'm afraid you'll be
a pretty pathetic king.

295
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,509
Well, I'm not letting anyone
tell me where to go,

296
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
what to do...

297
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,954
and even who to marry.

298
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,951
There will never be a king
like me.

299
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,317
Simba, you can't escape
your destiny.

300
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,993
Just watch.

301
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,192
(SINGING)
I'm gonna be a mighty king

302
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,237
So enemies beware

303
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,353
ZAZU: (SINGING) Well, I've
never seen a king of beasts

304
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,396
With quite so little hair

305
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,317
I'm gonna be the main event
Like no king was before

306
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,320
I'm brushing up
on looking down

307
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,118
Working on my roar

308
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,636
(LAUGHS) Thus far
a rather uninspiring thing

309
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,555
SIMBA: Oh, I just can't wait
to be king

310
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,836
You have rather a long way
to go, young master.

311
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,115
If you think...

312
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,480
SIMBA: No one saying "do this"

313
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,880
ZAZU: Now, when I said that...

314
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,279
NALA: No one saying "be there"

315
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,440
ZAZU: What I meant was...

316
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,471
SIMBA: No one saying
"stop that"

317
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,153
BOTH: No one saying "see here"

318
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,509
Now see here!

319
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,672
SIMBA: Free to run around
all day

320
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,239
ZAZU: Well,
that's definitely out.

321
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,836
Free to do it all my way

322
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,994
I think it's time
that you and I

323
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,877
Arranged a heart-to-heart

324
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,231
Kings don't need advice

325
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,880
From little hornbills
for a start

326
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,712
If this is where the monarchy

that those kings...
