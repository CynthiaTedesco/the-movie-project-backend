an "F"-word to me.</font>

135
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:41,445
<font color="#ffff00">Pile of shit father took
off and bailed, and...</font>

136
00:10:42,657 --> 00:10:46,578
<font color="#ffff00">It's not like I have a lot of strong
role models to draw off of for Todd.</font>

137
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:48,930
<font color="#ffff00">Hey.</font>

138
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,656
<font color="#ffff00">Look at me.</font>

139

<font color="#ffff00">You are not your father.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Besides...</font>

<font color="#ffff00">I will never, ever...</font>

142
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,063
<font color="#ffff00">let our child be named "Todd".</font>

143
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:05,220
<font color="#ffff00">But here's the thing. Isn't
that how it always works?</font>

144
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,028
<font color="#ffff00">Like in Star Wars...</font>

145

<font color="#ffff00">Men are destined to
become their father?</font>

146
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,965
<font color="#ffff00">And then have consensual
sex with their sister?</font>

147
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:15,824
<font color="#ffff00">I think you missed big,
big chunks of that movie.</font>

148

150
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,965
<font color="#ffff00">They give us a chance to
be better than we are.</font>

151
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:30,288
<font color="#ffff00">Better than we used to be.</font>

152

<font color="#ffff00">You're a lot smarter
than you look.</font>

154
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:39,869
<font color="#ffff00">You get the strap-on.
Let's make a superbaby.</font>

155
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:43,696
<font color="#ffff00">I'm pretty sure it doesn't
work that way but we can try.</font>

156
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:47,720
<font color="#ffff00">What about Krystal, with a K?</font>

157
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:49,508
<font color="#ffff00">That's too stripper-y.</font>

159
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:53,713
<font color="#ffff00">No. Too stripper-y too.</font>

160
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:55,552
<font color="#ffff00">Earl?</font>

161
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:00,178
<font color="#ffff00">He's gonna go straight to
jail if we name him Earl.</font>

162
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:03,334
<font color="#ffff00">What about Bruce?</font>

163
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,381
<font color="#ffff00">- Get down.
- What?</font>

164
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,378
<font color="#ffff00">Baby? Baby?</font>

165
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,191
<font color="#ffff00">I'm okay.</font>

166
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:46,128
<font color="#ffff00">Thank God, I didn't have to use
the cream cheese spreader.</font>

167
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:42,679
<font color="#ffff00">Papa, can you hear me?</font>

168
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:47,295
<font color="#ffff00">Is it just me or does "Do you want
to Build A Snowman" from Frozen</font>

169
00:16:47,311 --> 00:16:50,631
<font color="#ffff00">sounds suspiciously like "Papa,
Can You Hear Me" from Yentl?</font>

170

<font color="#ffff00">Papa, can you hear me?</font>

171
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:58,201
<font color="#ffff00">That nobody fucking realizes it.</font>

172
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:01,369
<font color="#ffff00">Go home. You've been here
for three days, okay?</font>

173
00:17:01,468 --> 00:17:05,327
<font color="#ffff00">You smell like somebody shit in a civil
war wound after it had become gangrenous</font>

174
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:09,007
<font color="#ffff00">They should've just amputated it. Why
shit in it. It doesn't make any sense.</font>

175
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:10,797
<font color="#ffff00">I love Frozen.</font>

like ocean loved water.</font>

180
00:17:20,758 --> 00:17:25,773
<font color="#ffff00">George Michael was right. I'm never
gonna dance again. Fuck. He's dead too.</font>

the fact that I think you're...</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Are you pissing? Are you urinating right now? You're
making the face that you make when you're urinating.</font>

188
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:49,874
<font color="#ffff00">You wanna be a contract killer, you're gonna
handle a mop before you handle a gun.</font>

how they are all similar.</font>

190
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,233
<font color="#ffff00">Well, they both have handles.
Now leave me.</font>

191
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:57,298
<font color="#ffff00">Go home, Wade.</font>

192
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,064
<font color="#ffff00">I don't have a home.</font>

193
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,572
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa. Okay, I'm fine.
Honestly, I'm fine.</font>

194
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,814

stands for, Wade?</font>

195
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:09,212
<font color="#ffff00">Fucked up, insecure,
neurotic and emotional.</font>

196
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,892
<font color="#ffff00">According to the...</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Kubler-Ross.</font>

198
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:18,555

Don't you know how to knock?</font>

203
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:12,545
<font color="#ffff00">I thought you saw me.
With your ears.</font>

209
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:29,498
<font color="#ffff00">Probably something terrible.</font>

210
00:19:29,874 --> 00:19:33,405
<font color="#ffff00">- Knowing you.
- It was my fault.</font>

211
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:36,201
<font color="#ffff00">I fucking did this.</font>

212
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:41,045
<font color="#ffff00">And all I wanna do is grab her, see her.
Tell her that I'm sorry and I can't.</font>

213
00:19:42,796 --> 00:19:44,608
<font color="#ffff00">She's gone.</font>

214
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,115
<font color="#ffff00">Sweetheart, can you speak up?</font>

215
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,255
<font color="#ffff00">It's a little hard to hear you with
that pity dick in your mouth.</font>

216
00:19:51,263 --> 00:19:52,466
<font color="#ffff00">Now look, sugar.</font>

217
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:55,341

- Thank you...</font>

words are a treasure.</font>

219

and fortune-teller.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Sometimes it's so bad, we
feel like we're dying.</font>

223
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:14,960
<font color="#ffff00">But we can't really live 'till
we die a little, can we?</font>

224
00:20:16,374 --> 00:20:17,491
<font color="#ffff00">Wade?</font>

- I'm right here, Althea.</font>

226
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:26,756
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe that's the most beautiful
thing I've ever heard.</font>

227
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:29,334
<font color="#ffff00">You're absolutely right.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">I'm about to do
something terrible.</font>

I can't get to you.</font>

not in the right place? What does it...</font>

241
00:22:03,028 --> 00:22:07,168
<font color="#ffff00">I'm terribly sorry for your loss, Wade.
You're broken.</font>

Heart's not, what does that mean?</font>

<font color="#ffff00">You've been sleep
for three days.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">- I took the liberty of dressing you.
- No shit.</font>

246
00:22:22,614 --> 00:22:26,442

- Take your mask off, Wade.</font>

247
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,762
<font color="#ffff00">We must talk. You
need fresh start.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">What, in the
fuck-knuckles is this?</font>

253
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:45,730

ready to be touched yet.</font>

men on the walls.</font>

266
00:23:24,715 --> 00:23:26,979
<font color="#ffff00">Should've brought
my rape whistle.</font>

267
00:23:27,463 --> 00:23:30,276
<font color="#ffff00">Those were already damaged
after they fell there.</font>

268
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,518
<font color="#ffff00">What am I supposed to do around here, anyway.
Sit in a share circle, talk about my feelings?</font>

269
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:37,540
<font color="#ffff00">And how would I do that,
exactly, because...</font>

270
00:23:37,588 --> 00:23:40,049
<font color="#ffff00">Where the fuck is everyone?</font>

271
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:42,322
<font color="#ffff00">It's always just you
and Negasonic Teenage</font>

273
00:23:44,643 --> 00:23:46,283
<font color="#ffff00">I said no touching.</font>

274
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:50,228
<font color="#ffff00">What the... fuck.</font>

275
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,025
<font color="#ffff00">You'd think the studio
would throw us a bone.</font>

276
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,565
<font color="#ffff00">They can't just dust off
one of the famous X-Men?</font>

277
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,824
<font color="#ffff00">How about that pots with the giant
pigeon wings? What do those do in there?</font>

278
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:02,409
<font color="#ffff00">Carry them three feet off the ground
to snatch up the nearest muffin crumb?</font>

Sceond, and more...</font>

283
00:24:13,968 --> 00:24:17,491
<font color="#ffff00">I should've left you in the
self-pitying mess I found you in.</font>

284
00:24:17,516 --> 00:24:20,374
<font color="#ffff00">But this is what friends do.
They show up.</font>

285
00:24:20,414 --> 00:24:22,242
<font color="#ffff00">Not when convenient or easy.</font>

286
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:23,390
<font color="#ffff00">When hard.</font>

neck out for you.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">One of the assholes who
killed Vanessa got away.</font>

291

down and bring them to justice.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">I killed every last one of them.
Except me.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">We were, uhh...</font>

299
00:25:07,477 --> 00:25:09,508
<font color="#ffff00">We were gonna be a family.</font>

300
00:25:09,988 --> 00:25:12,735
<font color="#ffff00">Wade, Vanessa is gone.</font>

301
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:14,899
<font color="#ffff00">She is not coming back.</font>

302

303
00:25:17,874 --> 00:25:20,280
<font color="#ffff00">But, it's family you need.</font>

304
00:25:20,363 --> 00:25:24,417
<font color="#ffff00">You have a good heart. It belongs
here, where it can grow.</font>

305
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,472
<font color="#ffff00">What did you say?</font>

306
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:30,049
<font color="#ffff00">About my heart?</font>

307

<font color="#ffff00">Wade!</font>

310
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:58,873
<font color="#ffff00">Hey. I was just taking Cerebro for a
spin here. Looking deep into the future.</font>

311
00:26:59,488 --> 00:27:02,470
<font color="#ffff00">- This thing...
- That's not how Cerebro works.</font>

- No. You want me to join.</font>

316
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:15,979
<font color="#ffff00">- I'm sorry. What?
- You are ready.</font>

317
00:27:16,006 --> 00:27:18,262
<font color="#ffff00">That's a terrible idea,
and it's gonna end badly.</font>

318
00:27:18,287 --> 00:27:20,307
<font color="#ffff00">You wanna know how I know?
I'll give you a hint.</font>

319
00:27:20,332 --> 00:27:23,534
<font color="#ffff00">It's on my head and smells
like Patrick Stewart.</font>

the Essex House for Mutant Rehabilitation.</font>

323
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:40,778
<font color="#ffff00">A mutant boy is appearing to have some sort
of an incident with police here behind me.</font>

324
00:27:40,803 --> 00:27:43,860
<font color="#ffff00">There are two police vehicles
that are overturned...</font>

325
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:46,756
<font color="#ffff00">A scene of absolute chaos...</font>

wanna fucking die?</font>

328
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:15,801
<font color="#ffff00">It appears as if the X-Men are arriving
with, what appears to be a trainee.</font>

329
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,123
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone calm down.
The pros are here.</font>

330
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:20,943
<font color="#ffff00">We're the X-Men.</font>

331
00:28:20,952 --> 00:28:23,646

racism in the '60s.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">So, respect.</font>

333
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,519
<font color="#ffff00">At ease, officer.</font>

334
00:28:28,652 --> 00:28:30,519
<font color="#ffff00">What are you doing?</font>

Not here.</font>

Not in prison.</font>

Let me talk to the kid.</font>

346
00:28:59,098 --> 00:29:01,902
<font color="#ffff00">You stay here wth your weird...</font>

347
00:29:01,927 --> 00:29:03,691
<font color="#ffff00">Secret sex lips.</font>

348
00:29:05,562 --> 00:29:08,685
<font color="#ffff00">- You wanna die?

349
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:13,022
<font color="#ffff00">- I'll burn your balls off.
- First day. I'm so nervous.</font>

350
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:15,166

351
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:18,776
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. Probably should've
brought a super soaker.</font>

352

Justin Bieber dies.</font>

354
00:29:25,018 --> 00:29:27,979

you Justin Bieber.</font>

355

<font color="#ffff00">Wait, wait. Okay,
let's not do...</font>

356
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,987
<font color="#ffff00">Whatever that is. Okay?</font>

357
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:36,840
<font color="#ffff00">Let's just talk. It's Russell.
Right?</font>

the refrigerator!</font>

You live in this dump? Well guess what?</font>

382
00:30:45,235 --> 00:30:47,703
<font color="#ffff00">I used to live in a
shithole just like it.</font>

397
00:31:56,885 --> 00:31:58,166
<font color="#ffff00">What's that do?</font>

398
00:31:58,198 --> 00:31:59,955

Can't get it off.</font>

00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:12,675

404
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:16,948
<font color="#ffff00">True heroism in action.
We are in your debt.</font>

Anywhere is better than here.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Believe me son, you do not
wanna go to the Icebox.</font>

408
00:32:25,387 --> 00:32:27,133
<font color="#ffff00">Let's get you inside, young man.</font>

409
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:31,056
<font color="#ffff00">No, wait. Wait, you just,
you guys stay there.</font>

410

- Four...</font>

415

<font color="#ffff00">Or five moments.</font>

416
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:08,864
<font color="#ffff00">That's all it takes
to be a hero.</font>

dispenser a hero.</font>

420

421
00:33:20,463 --> 00:33:23,016
<font color="#ffff00">takes only a few moments.</font>

422
00:33:23,055 --> 00:33:27,601
<font color="#ffff00">Few moments doing the ugly
stuff no one else will do.</font>

423

<font color="#ffff00">No!</font>

- Colossus, no!</font>

425
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:40,681

tell, you can always tell.</font>

426
00:33:40,706 --> 00:33:44,417

judge, jury or executioner.</font>

427
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:47,573
<font color="#ffff00">Fuck your rules. I fight
for what's right.</font>

428
00:33:47,581 --> 00:33:49,237
<font color="#ffff00">And sometimes, you
gotta fight dirty.</font>

the last time, Wade.</font>

00:34:22,492 --> 00:34:24,890
<font color="#ffff00">I wonder what gang I'll be in.</font>

431
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,718
<font color="#ffff00">Is there like a sorting hat?</font>

00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,347
<font color="#ffff00">Hard left, douchebag.</font>

God bless America.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Nighty-night, you
annoying prick.</font>

437
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:29,407
<font color="#ffff00">But I'm gonna tell you
what the big lie is.</font>

438
00:35:29,486 --> 00:35:30,759
<font color="#ffff00">Toilet paper.</font>

439

<font color="#ffff00">Toilet paper is
certified appetizer.</font>

00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:35,759
<font color="#ffff00">But then...</font>

441
00:35:36,419 --> 00:35:38,778
<font color="#ffff00">Huggies Natural Care wet wipes.</font>

442
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:42,090
<font color="#ffff00">That's your main course. They're soft.
They're moist.</font>

443
00:35:42,114 --> 00:35:44,067
<font color="#ffff00">They're for babies.</font>

444
00:35:44,146 --> 00:35:48,911
<font color="#ffff00">And finally. One more patch of toilet paper
made me clear out that excess moisture.</font>

445
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,906
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe treat yourself to a glow and go
if you can get you a hair dryer.</font>

446
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:54,687
<font color="#ffff00">Just about thirty seconds
until you get...</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Year?</font>

449

<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

450
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:05,977
<font color="#ffff00">What year is it?</font>

451
00:36:06,149 --> 00:36:08,914
<font color="#ffff00">What kind of dumbass
question is that to ask?</font>

452
00:36:27,423 --> 00:36:30,899
<font color="#ffff00">- You're a long way from your superpowers.
- Yeah.</font>

453
00:36:30,965 --> 00:36:32,055
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

454
00:36:35,631 --> 00:36:37,787
<font color="#ffff00">I wanted to be a superhero.</font>

455
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,370
<font color="#ffff00">Always wanted my own supersuit.</font>

- When's the last time you saw a plus-sized superhero?</font>

457
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,332
<font color="#ffff00">Never. The industry
discriminates.</font>

458
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,231
<font color="#ffff00">Fuck superheroes.</font>

459
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,928
<font color="#ffff00">Fuck everyone.</font>

460

<font color="#ffff00">The first thing I'm gonna do
when I get out of here...</font>

461
00:36:55,014 --> 00:37:00,381
<font color="#ffff00">Burn the Headmaster alive, and then take
a selfie with the smoldering corpse.</font>

462
00:37:00,505 --> 00:37:02,889
<font color="#ffff00">Who says prison
isn't informative?</font>

are healed by my hand.</font>

biggest guy in here.</font>

- That is the biggest guy in here.</font>

though no one's ever seen it,</font>

<font color="#ffff00">they keep a monster
in the basement.</font>

is just unbridled cancer.</font>

I'm basically Hawkeye.</font>

know what you're saying.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">I can hear you rummaging
around in there.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Here to update you on the
story reported earlier...</font>

<font color="#ffff00">After a lengthy stand-off outside the
Essex House for Mutant Rehabilitation,</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, what I mean is the word selfless.
I really don't know what that means.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Sorry you had to see that.
No, I'm glad you heard it.</font>

00:56:58,056 --> 00:57:01,657
<font color="#ffff00">This is convoy 17. Departing the Icebox.
We're inbound.</font>

654
00:57:09,504 --> 00:57:12,277
<font color="#ffff00">Peacetime makes people soft.</font>

655
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:15,691
<font color="#ffff00">I was born into war.</font>

656
00:57:16,738 --> 00:57:18,784
<font color="#ffff00">Bred into it.</font>

657
00:57:19,105 --> 00:57:22,331
<font color="#ffff00">- Okay.
- People think they understand pain.</font>

658
00:57:22,885 --> 00:57:26,322
<font color="#ffff00">What's the most pain
you've ever felt?</font>

659
00:57:27,306 --> 00:57:29,986
<font color="#ffff00">- These strains are pretty...
- I've done a list.</font>

660
00:57:30,775 --> 00:57:35,345
<font color="#ffff00">We're gonna work down it.
Together.</font>

661
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:38,595
<font color="#ffff00">Number one, I'm gonna
bend something.</font>

662
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,110
<font color="#ffff00">Something that was
not meant to bend.</font>

663
00:57:41,134 --> 00:57:43,430
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, I'm gonna stop you right there.
Because I'm not gonna make it to two.</font>

664
00:57:43,447 --> 00:57:46,516
<font color="#ffff00">I won't even make it to one. I
don't do well with pain, you know?</font>

665
00:57:46,532 --> 00:57:49,134
<font color="#ffff00">I'm done for the day.</font>

666
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:51,469
<font color="#ffff00">I cried when they
cancelled Felicity.</font>

667
00:57:51,486 --> 00:57:54,782
<font color="#ffff00">Right. I'm really scared, I get nervous
erections. I got one right now.</font>

668
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:58,579
<font color="#ffff00">Don't look at it, only make it worse. I don't
want you to hurt me and I'll tell you anything,</font>

669
00:57:58,611 --> 00:58:02,719
<font color="#ffff00">anything you wanna know.
Except for where they are.</font>

670
00:58:02,806 --> 00:58:08,282
<font color="#ffff00">Russell's in a convoy heading southbound on Cherry Duggan
parkway. The monster's with him. I wouldn't fuck with him.</font>

671
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:12,384
<font color="#ffff00">Intercept the convoy. Grab the boy.
Not inappropriately.</font>

672
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:15,954
<font color="#ffff00">Know what, I wouldn't fuck with Deadpool
either. Because he's built a team.</font>

673
00:58:15,979 --> 00:58:20,057
<font color="#ffff00">- He's unstoppable.
- He has an ass-pen. He'll stab you with it.</font>

674
00:58:20,074 --> 00:58:22,480
<font color="#ffff00">Watch out for this guy, Cable.</font>

675
00:58:22,488 --> 00:58:25,949
<font color="#ffff00">He's very short. 5'11".
Not like in the comics.</font>

676
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,558
<font color="#ffff00">And if we succeed, we'll
all go home early.</font>

677
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:31,614
<font color="#ffff00">So you go after them Cable.
I warn you.</font>

678
00:58:32,138 --> 00:58:34,556
<font color="#ffff00">There's a wind
advisory in effect.</font>

679
00:58:44,894 --> 00:58:47,136
<font color="#ffff00">A little turbulent out there.</font>

680
00:58:53,898 --> 00:58:56,484
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know much about this
Cable fella, but I guarantee,</font>

681
00:58:56,509 --> 00:58:59,187
<font color="#ffff00">he hasn't killed as many
people as melanoma has.</font>

682
00:59:00,686 --> 00:59:03,774
<font color="#ffff00">- We're getting close.
- As a former X-Man...</font>

683
00:59:03,777 --> 00:59:05,475
<font color="#ffff00">- Trainee.
- Thank you, Bedlam.</font>

684
00:59:05,499 --> 00:59:09,437
<font color="#ffff00">I was always appalled by the blatant
sexism in the group's name.</font>

685
00:59:09,461 --> 00:59:11,382
<font color="#ffff00">"X-Men?" Men?</font>

686
00:59:11,421 --> 00:59:15,803
<font color="#ffff00">The point is our group will be
forward-thinking. Gender neutral.</font>

687
00:59:15,828 --> 00:59:19,124
<font color="#ffff00">From now on, we'll
be known as...</font>

688
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:21,974
<font color="#ffff00">X-Force.</font>

689
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:26,420
<font color="#ffff00">- Isn't that a little derivative?
- I don't recall asking your opinion, Peter.</font>

690
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,981
<font color="#ffff00">That wasn't me.</font>

691
00:59:35,671 --> 00:59:39,860
<font color="#ffff00">Hang along, we are at 1,300 feet.
Intercept the convoy and grab the boy.</font>

692
00:59:39,885 --> 00:59:43,525
<font color="#ffff00">- Let's bring on the carnage, baby!
- Get me on the ground, watch me go!</font>

693
00:59:43,549 --> 00:59:45,369
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah!
- Woo!</font>

694
00:59:47,463 --> 00:59:51,228
<font color="#ffff00">I just... I just wanna say
how proud I am of this team.</font>

695
00:59:51,253 --> 00:59:54,292
<font color="#ffff00">You know, you guys,
look amazing.</font>

696
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:57,166
<font color="#ffff00">Vanisher I have no doubt
you look amazing, too.</font>

697
00:59:57,191 --> 01:00:00,347
<font color="#ffff00">If this is the family that I've
always dreamed of having, I had...</font>

698
01:00:00,707 --> 01:00:03,480
<font color="#ffff00">Shit. I missed out.</font>

699
01:00:03,511 --> 01:00:05,456
<font color="#ffff00">I have struggles
with that sometimes.</font>

700
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:09,138
<font color="#ffff00">- I hate to interrupt but is anybody
nervous about the hard winds?
- Gary.</font>

701
01:00:09,163 --> 01:00:11,890
<font color="#ffff00">- My name's Peter.
- I realize you're new to this. Relax.</font>

702
01:00:11,915 --> 01:00:14,969
<font color="#ffff00">- You've been chosen by a higher power.
- Did he just call himself god?</font>

703
01:00:15,001 --> 01:00:17,051
<font color="#ffff00">- I think he did.
- I'd like to go home.</font>

704
01:00:17,076 --> 01:00:19,996
<font color="#ffff00">And I'd like the McRib to
be available year-round!</font>

705
01:00:20,021 --> 01:00:22,072
<font color="#ffff00">But sometimes dreams
don't come true...</font>

706
01:00:22,074 --> 01:00:24,071
<font color="#ffff00">I spend 10 years
in Special Forces,</font>

707
01:00:24,096 --> 01:00:27,510
<font color="#ffff00">You think we didn't jump out the
plane to get a light breeze?</font>

708
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,661
<font color="#ffff00">Your in this shit now, moustache!</font>

709
01:00:29,731 --> 01:00:31,890
<font color="#ffff00">I'm only yelling to
impress the other guys.</font>

710
01:00:31,915 --> 01:00:34,343
<font color="#ffff00">I'll never let anything
happen to you, Sugarbear.</font>

711
01:00:34,359 --> 01:00:37,679
<font color="#ffff00">Hit it!</font>

712
01:00:44,772 --> 01:00:48,076
<font color="#ffff00">Go! Go! Go!</font>

713
01:01:22,281 --> 01:01:23,875
<font color="#ffff00">Let's get some!</font>

714
01:01:25,243 --> 01:01:26,586
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, yeah!</font>

715
01:01:26,611 --> 01:01:30,001
<font color="#ffff00">Convoy, 12 o'clock.
On my command.</font>

716
01:01:30,189 --> 01:01:32,400
<font color="#ffff00">Deploy!</font>

717
01:01:38,826 --> 01:01:41,029
<font color="#ffff00">A little off-course here.</font>

718
01:01:42,287 --> 01:01:45,287
<font color="#ffff00">Holy mommy fucking shit!</font>

719
01:01:46,396 --> 01:01:50,419
<font color="#ffff00">There they are. Look at these
gorgeous sons of bitches.</font>

720
01:01:51,286 --> 01:01:53,692
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, yeah. That's right, Bedlam.</font>

721
01:01:59,331 --> 01:02:02,096
<font color="#ffff00">Motherfucking village!</font>

722
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:05,980
<font color="#ffff00">Shatterstar. Okay. You got this.</font>

723
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:08,800
<font color="#ffff00">Left. Left!</font>

724
01:02:08,816 --> 01:02:11,566
<font color="#ffff00">Left, you idiot!</font>

725
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:18,656
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I guess we found
something you're not good at.</font>

726
01:02:19,493 --> 01:02:20,875
<font color="#ffff00">Vanisher.</font>

727
01:02:20,985 --> 01:02:23,820
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe the wind can't
blow what it can't see.</font>

728
01:02:26,094 --> 01:02:29,703
<font color="#ffff00">Really? All right. We
can do this with four.</font>

729
01:02:30,133 --> 01:02:32,843
<font color="#ffff00">Sugarbear. You got this, buddy.</font>

730
01:02:32,883 --> 01:02:36,164
<font color="#ffff00">That's the stuff.
That's the X-Force spirit.</font>

731
01:02:36,189 --> 01:02:40,601
<font color="#ffff00">Never underestimate a man in a moustache.
Just ask anyone in Brooklyn.</font>

732
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:44,640
<font color="#ffff00">- You're a goddamn superhero, you!
- X-Force!</font>

733
01:02:44,665 --> 01:02:46,290
<font color="#ffff00">X-Force!</font>

734
01:02:55,684 --> 01:02:58,801
<font color="#ffff00">- Peter.
- I got you. You'll be fine.</font>

735
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,777
<font color="#ffff00">You got this big guy.
There we go, Peter!</font>

736
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:05,777
<font color="#ffff00">- We're X-Force, right?
- We're X-Force!</font>

737
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:11,075
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, my God! What the fuck?</font>

738
01:03:11,107 --> 01:03:13,880
<font color="#ffff00">Fucking acidic vomit!</font>

739
01:03:14,928 --> 01:03:18,185
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, God.</font>

740
01:03:20,723 --> 01:03:25,371
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, I'm over the convoy. Where
did the rest of the team land?</font>

741
01:03:25,574 --> 01:03:27,355
<font color="#ffff00">Good news and bad news.</font>

742
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:30,566
<font color="#ffff00">The bad news is, the
whole team is dead.</font>

743
01:03:30,645 --> 01:03:33,941
<font color="#ffff00">The good news is, I don't think
anyone's gonna miss Shatterstar.</font>

744
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:37,786
<font color="#ffff00">- He was a bit of a prick. But Paul!
- Peter.</font>

745
01:03:37,817 --> 01:03:39,889
<font color="#ffff00">Peter. We'll miss him most.</font>

746
01:03:39,914 --> 01:03:42,945
<font color="#ffff00">But there is a slight chance
Vanisher could make it.</font>

747
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:46,242
<font color="#ffff00">- Nope. No chance. He's dead.
- The whole team?</font>

748
01:03:46,267 --> 01:03:49,689
<font color="#ffff00">- Only the main ones, we're still good.
- Fuck, you are dumb.</font>

749
01:03:49,714 --> 01:03:54,487
<font color="#ffff00">Even after all this time, I still can't talk about
it. Who knew these winds would be so strong?</font>

750
01:03:54,512 --> 01:03:58,887
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone. Everyone on the helicopter.
Everyone not on the helicopter.</font>

751
01:04:06,821 --> 01:04:10,222
<font color="#ffff00">They're headed into the tunnel.</font>

752
01:04:10,391 --> 01:04:14,422
<font color="#ffff00">I'm that kid's only hope. So sit
tight and wait for my word.</font>

753
01:04:14,742 --> 01:04:21,648
<font color="#ffff00">- Whatever. We're gonna lose them. I'm dropping in.
- That's a negative, sole survivor. Luck isn't a superpower.</font>

754
01:04:21,673 --> 01:04:25,712
<font color="#ffff00">- We are so fucked.
- No. We are certainly not fucked.</font>

755
01:04:28,579 --> 01:04:31,406
<font color="#ffff00">Seriously, I don't get it.</font>

756
01:04:31,431 --> 01:04:34,266
<font color="#ffff00">What, you shoot luck
lasers out of your eyes?</font>

757
01:04:35,895 --> 01:04:40,434
<font color="#ffff00">It's just hard to picture. It's
certainly not very cinematic.</font>

758
01:04:42,777 --> 01:04:45,434
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, luck? What coked out,</font>

759

with that little chest turd?</font>

761
01:04:50,235 --> 01:04:53,514
<font color="#ffff00">Probably a guy who
can't draw feet!</font>

762
01:05:03,563 --> 01:05:06,277
<font color="#ffff00">Once again, it all
falls on my shoulders.</font>

763
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:08,793
<font color="#ffff00">It's why I'm cursed
to be a solo act.</font>

764
01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:10,943
<font color="#ffff00">- I'm in.
- I'm sorry. What did you say?</font>

765
01:05:10,968 --> 01:05:14,272
<font color="#ffff00">- I'm in.
- How in the fuck are you in already?</font>

766
01:05:14,297 --> 01:05:19,148
<font color="#ffff00">- Oh, shit. Cable, 12 o'clock!
- Shit! New plan.</font>

767
01:05:19,173 --> 01:05:23,243
<font color="#ffff00">Use all of your imaginary powers to
stop Cable from killing that kid.</font>

768
01:05:23,268 --> 01:05:25,728
<font color="#ffff00">I'm coming up on your six.</font>

769
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:36,845
<font color="#ffff00">That is amazing!</font>

770
01:05:46,221 --> 01:05:50,377
<font color="#ffff00">- Where is he? I can't see him.
- He's on top of you!</font>

771
01:05:51,954 --> 01:05:55,539
<font color="#ffff00">He's going in through the back!
Oh, God, he's inside!</font>

772
01:05:55,564 --> 01:05:58,486
<font color="#ffff00">- You hear yourself, right?
- Accidental double entendres!</font>

773

<font color="#ffff00">Two can play that game.</font>

777
01:06:39,957 --> 01:06:42,136
<font color="#ffff00">Got it! No, I don't.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Hang in there, Dom!
This is really hard.</font>

did not go according to plan.</font>

guy's in the mood.</font>

801

- Friend?</font>

You said it yourself.</font>

The decision is killing me.</font>

everything he wanted to know.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Zip it, Black-Black Widow. I'm flowing. The first
order of business is to get me in front of Cable</font>

01:15:52,944 --> 01:15:57,334
<font color="#ffff00">so I can put all the fucking blood out of his
body and fashion his bones into holiday jewelry.</font>

883
01:15:57,412 --> 01:15:59,294
<font color="#ffff00">Then, I'm gonna take his skin.</font>

884
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:02,724
<font color="#ffff00">And stretch it out over
our homemade mating drum.</font>

Grindr?</font>

to fuck, future boy.</font>

889

<font color="#ffff00">Is that really necessary?</font>

890
01:16:27,032 --> 01:16:30,124
<font color="#ffff00">No. It's his Basic Instinct.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">What can we help you with?</font>

892
01:16:31,992 --> 01:16:34,577
<font color="#ffff00">I'm here to proposition you.</font>

893
01:16:36,148 --> 01:16:39,624
<font color="#ffff00">- He's really teeing it up, is he?
- He gets to make the first joke.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Even if we were...</font>

907
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:10,244
<font color="#ffff00">There's a wind
advisory in effect...</font>

908

friend's about to make his first kill.</font>

909

<font color="#ffff00">No offense, but if
you know so much,</font>

910
01:17:14,998 --> 01:17:17,573
<font color="#ffff00">why not travel back to when he
was a baby and kill him then?</font>

911
01:17:17,598 --> 01:17:22,144
<font color="#ffff00">- Or better yet, head back a little further. Kill baby Hitler.
- I use a device to slide through time.</font>

912
01:17:22,169 --> 01:17:24,683
<font color="#ffff00">The longer I travel, the
harder it is to control.</font>

913
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:29,075
<font color="#ffff00">I got two charges. One to get
me here, one to get me home.</font>

914
01:17:29,481 --> 01:17:34,721
<font color="#ffff00">- That's just lazy writing.
- Your boy's gonna kill the Headmaster in the orphanage tonight.</font>

915
01:17:34,746 --> 01:17:39,761
<font color="#ffff00">- After that, he gets a real taste for it.
- Like 10-year old Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker.</font>

916
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:42,966
<font color="#ffff00">So he keeps killing.
And killing.</font>

917
01:17:43,529 --> 01:17:44,971
<font color="#ffff00">And killing.</font>

918
01:17:44,996 --> 01:17:48,831
<font color="#ffff00">Until one day he kills the
wrong fucking people.</font>

919

<font color="#ffff00">My people.</font>

920
01:17:55,477 --> 01:17:57,046
<font color="#ffff00">Relax.</font>

921
01:17:57,071 --> 01:17:59,789
<font color="#ffff00">I'm retrieving something
from my utility bag.</font>

922
01:17:59,814 --> 01:18:04,501
<font color="#ffff00">It's a goddamn fanny pack and you
know it, you sick son of a bitch.</font>

923
01:18:04,526 --> 01:18:06,947
<font color="#ffff00">The difference is night and day.</font>

924
01:18:08,342 --> 01:18:10,541
<font color="#ffff00">You remind me of my wife.</font>

925
01:18:11,084 --> 01:18:13,436
<font color="#ffff00">- I'm sorry?
- I said, you remind me of my...</font>

926
01:18:13,461 --> 01:18:17,617
<font color="#ffff00">No, I'm sorry that you said that. While making
heavy eye contact and applying lip balm.</font>

927
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:19,562
<font color="#ffff00">She always joked.</font>

928
01:18:19,703 --> 01:18:21,426
<font color="#ffff00">And she was funny.</font>

929
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:24,419
<font color="#ffff00">She filtered her pain.
Replaced it with humor.</font>

930
01:18:24,537 --> 01:18:27,310
<font color="#ffff00">Something I could never master.</font>

931
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:30,163
<font color="#ffff00">It was my fault she died.</font>

932
01:18:31,358 --> 01:18:34,821
<font color="#ffff00">It was my job to stop
people like him.</font>

933
01:18:35,147 --> 01:18:39,081
<font color="#ffff00">I came close, a few times.</font>

934
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:44,048
<font color="#ffff00">I wasn't too happy about that.</font>

935
01:18:44,649 --> 01:18:48,672
<font color="#ffff00">But he was trying to hurt me and
he knew exactly how to do it.</font>

936
01:18:52,245 --> 01:18:56,127
<font color="#ffff00">Blessed are the wicked who
are healed by my hand.</font>

937
01:18:58,537 --> 01:19:00,872
<font color="#ffff00">He came into my home...</font>

938
01:19:00,897 --> 01:19:04,029
<font color="#ffff00">And took the only thing
that made it a home.</font>

939
01:19:07,999 --> 01:19:11,725
<font color="#ffff00">- Sound familiar?
- I'm sorry.</font>

940
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,359
<font color="#ffff00">No. I'm really sorry.</font>

941
01:19:15,837 --> 01:19:17,930
<font color="#ffff00">But that isn't Russell.</font>

942
01:19:18,188 --> 01:19:20,266
<font color="#ffff00">- It doesn't have to be him.
- If you knew what I knew...</font>

943
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:25,220
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. He's got anger issues. Maybe a small
learning disability. A splash of diabetes.</font>

944
01:19:25,252 --> 01:19:28,306
<font color="#ffff00">- But nothing that can't be fixed...
- If you can go back...</font>

945
01:19:28,336 --> 01:19:31,021
<font color="#ffff00">And stop the people that
took your girl, would you?</font>

946
01:19:31,046 --> 01:19:33,215
<font color="#ffff00">Of course, I fucking would.</font>

947
01:19:33,365 --> 01:19:36,660
<font color="#ffff00">- But I wouldn't kill a kid.
- I'm not asking you to kill the kid.</font>

948
01:19:36,685 --> 01:19:38,339
<font color="#ffff00">I'll kill the kid.</font>

949
01:19:38,364 --> 01:19:41,846
<font color="#ffff00">I'm asking you to save
hundreds of other kids.</font>

950
01:19:41,871 --> 01:19:44,402
<font color="#ffff00">Russell's gonna burn
down that orphanage.</font>

951
01:19:44,427 --> 01:19:49,231
<font color="#ffff00">And I can imagine your dead girlfriend would've
wanted you to do the right thing, wouldn't she?</font>

952
01:19:49,571 --> 01:19:52,923
<font color="#ffff00">So what's it gonna be, handsome?</font>

953
01:19:52,948 --> 01:19:55,237
<font color="#ffff00">- Give me a chance to save him.
- What?</font>

954
01:19:55,262 --> 01:19:57,933
<font color="#ffff00">You said it. Once he kills
someone, he gets a taste for it.</font>

955
01:19:57,958 --> 01:20:02,003
<font color="#ffff00">If we can get to him before that happens,
promise you'll give me a chance,</font>

956
01:20:02,028 --> 01:20:05,020
<font color="#ffff00">- to put him on a different path.
- Define "chance".</font>

957
01:20:05,045 --> 01:20:07,363
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know. How long does it
take to save someone's soul?</font>

958
01:20:07,388 --> 01:20:10,214
<font color="#ffff00">- I give you 30 seconds.
- That--- what? No.</font>

959
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,540
<font color="#ffff00">Best I can do. Take
it or leave it.</font>

960
01:20:22,922 --> 01:20:25,468
<font color="#ffff00">He's doing it. Look
at the little fella.</font>

961
01:20:25,493 --> 01:20:27,977
<font color="#ffff00">He's doing it. Here it comes.</font>

962
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,539
<font color="#ffff00">Jesus Christ.</font>

963
01:20:29,564 --> 01:20:32,094
<font color="#ffff00">Just shirt cockin'.</font>

964
01:20:32,868 --> 01:20:36,927
<font color="#ffff00">Here you go, little fella.
Go on, you're doing it.</font>

965
01:20:36,952 --> 01:20:40,373
<font color="#ffff00">You beautiful, hairless,
twizzler-legged baby boy.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Christ.</font>

967
01:20:43,242 --> 01:20:44,726
<font color="#ffff00">That's disturbing.</font>

968
01:20:44,751 --> 01:20:47,008
<font color="#ffff00">Thirty seconds.</font>

969
01:20:51,496 --> 01:20:54,097

- Deal.</font>

970
01:20:55,757 --> 01:21:00,163

- Probably for the best.</font>

eat a raw starfish.</font>

977
01:21:22,703 --> 01:21:25,086

978

it in an Indian accent?</font>

racist, you moron.</font>

in this future anyway, huh?</font>

985
01:21:43,327 --> 01:21:44,422

You trusted me,</font>

01:24:20,071 --> 01:24:22,281
<font color="#ffff00">And he's not alone.</font>

1034
01:24:22,313 --> 01:24:24,774
<font color="#ffff00">Secure the children.</font>

1035
01:24:28,072 --> 01:24:31,009
<font color="#ffff00">What do you say we go
fuck some shit up?</font>

1036
01:24:31,034 --> 01:24:32,657
<font color="#ffff00">"Let's fuck some shit up",</font>

1037
01:24:32,682 --> 01:24:34,978
<font color="#ffff00">is my legal middle name.</font>

1038
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:41,016
<font color="#ffff00">Watch my back. I
got the old man.</font>

1039
01:24:41,079 --> 01:24:42,998
<font color="#ffff00">Amen, brother.</font>

1040
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:50,477
<font color="#ffff00">Time to get the chimichangas.</font>

1041
01:24:50,532 --> 01:24:52,086
<font color="#ffff00">Thirty seconds.</font>

1042
01:24:52,772 --> 01:24:55,303
<font color="#ffff00">I finally know why I'm here.</font>

1043
01:24:55,444 --> 01:24:57,444
<font color="#ffff00">I was raised in this place.</font>

1044
01:24:57,485 --> 01:24:59,748
<font color="#ffff00">But... not raised.
I was tortured.</font>

1045
01:24:59,781 --> 01:25:03,134
<font color="#ffff00">Wow. It's your cosmic reason
for being here. Shall we?</font>

1046
01:25:03,159 --> 01:25:05,195
<font color="#ffff00">This is gonna be fun!</font>

1047
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:07,852
<font color="#ffff00">Hey. Been meaning to ask
you, what's with the,</font>

1048
01:25:07,876 --> 01:25:10,383
<font color="#ffff00">creepy, dirty hobo-bear?</font>

1049
01:25:10,454 --> 01:25:14,149
<font color="#ffff00">That's not dirt. That's the
blood of my dead daughter.</font>

1050
01:25:16,204 --> 01:25:18,141
<font color="#ffff00">I get gluten sensitivity.</font>

1051
01:25:18,173 --> 01:25:21,938
<font color="#ffff00">One glass of wine would just....
Yeah.</font>

1052
01:25:25,447 --> 01:25:28,471
<font color="#ffff00">Wish we could head back in
time and take all that back.</font>

1053
01:25:28,502 --> 01:25:30,462
<font color="#ffff00">We should just cue the music.</font>

1054
01:25:55,004 --> 01:25:56,893
<font color="#ffff00">Welcome home, Russell.</font>

1055
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,785
<font color="#ffff00">We missed you.</font>

1056
01:25:59,059 --> 01:26:01,434
<font color="#ffff00">Russell! You don't need to do this.</font>

1057
01:26:01,501 --> 01:26:03,040
<font color="#ffff00">Let's talk.</font>

1058
01:26:03,434 --> 01:26:06,004
<font color="#ffff00">Why are you dressed
like the Unabomber?</font>

1059
01:26:08,918 --> 01:26:11,339
<font color="#ffff00">- That's why.
- This little fucker's too far gone.</font>

1060
01:26:11,365 --> 01:26:14,333
<font color="#ffff00">Zip it, Thanos. We have a deal.
You...</font>

1061
01:26:14,642 --> 01:26:15,631
<font color="#ffff00">Hey!</font>

1062
01:26:15,656 --> 01:26:19,999
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna shove that cab
driver right up your ass.</font>

1063
01:26:20,163 --> 01:26:22,538
<font color="#ffff00">My modelling hands are so soft.</font>

1064
01:26:22,569 --> 01:26:25,358
<font color="#ffff00">- You should probably head back to the car.
- I think I'll head back to the car.</font>

1065
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,725
<font color="#ffff00">It works best when you
pull the trigger.</font>

1066
01:26:32,357 --> 01:26:34,700
<font color="#ffff00">Your gun's amazing.</font>

1067
01:26:34,912 --> 01:26:36,436
<font color="#ffff00">Say it!</font>

1068
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:41,763
<font color="#ffff00">You are an abomination!</font>

1069
01:26:48,684 --> 01:26:51,941
<font color="#ffff00">Now I'm gonna shove the
red guy up the old guy.</font>

1070
01:26:51,966 --> 01:26:54,623
<font color="#ffff00">I believe him. Every
man for themselves!</font>

1071
01:26:58,896 --> 01:27:00,528
<font color="#ffff00">Gotcha!</font>

1072
01:27:04,638 --> 01:27:07,755
<font color="#ffff00">You okay, big guy? The
sun's getting real low.</font>

1073
01:27:07,779 --> 01:27:09,888
<font color="#ffff00">Ah, shit-fucker.</font>

1074
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:24,929
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, beautiful.</font>

1075
01:27:26,561 --> 01:27:28,077
<font color="#ffff00">Say it!</font>

1076
01:28:26,568 --> 01:28:28,224
<font color="#ffff00">You came for me.</font>

1077
01:28:28,232 --> 01:28:31,912
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not giving up on you and
you're not giving up on that boy.</font>

1078
01:28:31,937 --> 01:28:33,929
<font color="#ffff00">Who says that rules aren't
meant to be broken?</font>

1079
01:28:33,953 --> 01:28:36,413
<font color="#ffff00">It's time to fight dirty.</font>

1080
01:28:36,429 --> 01:28:38,679
<font color="#ffff00">- Time to see the light, Johnny.
- Hey!</font>

1081
01:28:38,703 --> 01:28:42,694
<font color="#ffff00">- Pick on someone your own size.
- That's such a you thing to say.</font>

1082
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:44,749
<font color="#ffff00">Go get 'em, tiger!</font>

1083
01:28:44,785 --> 01:28:47,730
<font color="#ffff00">Big CGI fight coming up.</font>

1084
01:29:09,687 --> 01:29:12,335
<font color="#ffff00">- He's doing great.
- Say it!</font>

1085
01:29:16,293 --> 01:29:18,769
<font color="#ffff00">- Russell.
- Bingo!</font>

1086
01:29:33,423 --> 01:29:34,485
<font color="#ffff00">Great.</font>

1087
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:37,485
<font color="#ffff00">Bunch of armed pedophiles
in nursing shoes.</font>

1088
01:29:37,509 --> 01:29:40,641
<font color="#ffff00">- Can I have one of those guns?
- No.</font>

1089
01:29:40,681 --> 01:29:42,360
<font color="#ffff00">That's fine.</font>

1090
01:29:43,102 --> 01:29:46,648
<font color="#ffff00">Just gonna use this brick.
Maximum effort.</font>

1091
01:29:52,313 --> 01:29:55,250
<font color="#ffff00">Who says you can't
go home again?</font>

1092
01:30:14,601 --> 01:30:16,226
<font color="#ffff00">Say it.</font>

1093
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:19,585
<font color="#ffff00">Say what you say everytime
you torture me.</font>

1094
01:30:19,663 --> 01:30:20,663
<font color="#ffff00">Say it!</font>

1095
01:30:20,711 --> 01:30:24,655
<font color="#ffff00">Blessed are the wicked who are healed!
By my hand!</font>

1096
01:30:25,109 --> 01:30:30,655
<font color="#ffff00">Blessed are the wicked, who
are healed by my hand.</font>

1097
01:30:48,629 --> 01:30:51,004
<font color="#ffff00">Carny motherfucker!</font>

1098
01:31:17,017 --> 01:31:19,751
<font color="#ffff00">Oh my God. Did you
feel that, too?</font>

1099
01:31:19,776 --> 01:31:22,954
<font color="#ffff00">Only best buddies execute
pedophiles together.</font>

1100
01:31:24,883 --> 01:31:28,906
<font color="#ffff00">- You got 30 seconds, you butt-plug.
- Now you're getting it!</font>

1101
01:31:32,871 --> 01:31:35,746
<font color="#ffff00">I need a bus to get
you all out of here.</font>

1102
01:31:40,691 --> 01:31:42,651
<font color="#ffff00">Orphans...</font>

1103
01:31:42,683 --> 01:31:44,558
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, geez.</font>

1104
01:31:45,558 --> 01:31:47,339
<font color="#ffff00">It's time...</font>

1105
01:31:47,378 --> 01:31:51,542
<font color="#ffff00">- To burn for what you've done!
- A child should not be burdened with such power.</font>

1106
01:31:59,549 --> 01:32:01,627
<font color="#ffff00">Russell! Wait!</font>

1107
01:32:15,187 --> 01:32:18,233
<font color="#ffff00">- Wait! He hasn't killed anyone yet.
- What more do you need to see?</font>

1108
01:32:18,265 --> 01:32:20,622
<font color="#ffff00">Don't you fucking dare!
He's just a kid.</font>

1109
01:32:20,647 --> 01:32:23,006
<font color="#ffff00">Tick-tock. He is one.</font>

1110
01:32:35,121 --> 01:32:38,534
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna melt you down
and make a cock ring.</font>

1111
01:32:58,452 --> 01:33:01,561
<font color="#ffff00">- I told you! Leave me alone!
- Come on.</font>

1112
01:33:01,592 --> 01:33:03,912
<font color="#ffff00">Listen to me.</font>

1113
01:33:26,586 --> 01:33:29,712
<font color="#ffff00">That's how we do it
in Mother Russia.</font>

1114
01:33:30,973 --> 01:33:34,277
<font color="#ffff00">They say millenials are
the hardest to reach.</font>

1115
01:33:39,604 --> 01:33:42,588
<font color="#ffff00">Damn, it feels good
to be a gangstah.</font>

1116
01:33:42,768 --> 01:33:46,596
<font color="#ffff00">Go home, Wade. You're
ruining everything.</font>

1117
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:54,777
<font color="#ffff00">- I'm getting good at this shit.
- Go, go, go, go, go!</font>

1118
01:33:57,781 --> 01:34:01,921
<font color="#ffff00">He dies tonight, Wade.
You can't stop me.</font>

1119
01:34:02,242 --> 01:34:04,301
<font color="#ffff00">He even runs like a
fucking pervert.</font>

1120
01:34:04,326 --> 01:34:07,256
<font color="#ffff00">Like an online predator
who lost his laptop.</font>

1121
01:34:07,884 --> 01:34:10,212
<font color="#ffff00">I have one bullet
left in that gun.</font>

1122
01:34:10,237 --> 01:34:12,994
<font color="#ffff00">Wait, wait, wait. Please just
give me a second. I got this.</font>

1123
01:34:13,643 --> 01:34:15,775
<font color="#ffff00">Stay back! Go home, Wade.</font>

1124
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,133
<font color="#ffff00">Let's talk! There's
nothing going his way.</font>

1125
01:34:18,509 --> 01:34:20,157
<font color="#ffff00">That piece of shit...</font>

1126
01:34:20,182 --> 01:34:22,821
<font color="#ffff00">He deserves to die for what he did to you.
He hurt you.</font>

1127
01:34:22,846 --> 01:34:23,752
<font color="#ffff00">Badly.</font>

1128
01:34:23,777 --> 01:34:26,164
<font color="#ffff00">Makes you wanna hurt others.</font>

1129
01:34:26,189 --> 01:34:28,001
<font color="#ffff00">But if you kill him, he wins.</font>

1130
01:34:28,026 --> 01:34:30,145
<font color="#ffff00">You become everything
he says you are,</font>

1131
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:31,684
<font color="#ffff00">but worse.</font>

1132
01:34:31,841 --> 01:34:33,451
<font color="#ffff00">You're just a kid.</font>

1133
01:34:33,654 --> 01:34:35,672
<font color="#ffff00">You don't wanna hurt anyone.</font>

1134
01:34:35,697 --> 01:34:39,169
<font color="#ffff00">- How do you know what I want?
- Because I've been inside you.</font>

1135
01:34:39,228 --> 01:34:43,024
<font color="#ffff00">That came out wrong. I've
been inside your shoes.</font>

1136
01:34:43,062 --> 01:34:46,398
<font color="#ffff00">Which, is also off-putting.
It's not a good analogy.</font>

1137
01:34:46,422 --> 01:34:48,336
<font color="#ffff00">The point is...</font>

1138
01:34:48,383 --> 01:34:50,140
<font color="#ffff00">There are people.</font>

1139
01:34:50,164 --> 01:34:54,422
<font color="#ffff00">There are people in this
fucking world besides him,</font>

1140
01:34:54,447 --> 01:34:58,814
<font color="#ffff00">who will treat you right. It
isn't too late. Don't do it.</font>

1141
01:35:03,570 --> 01:35:06,218
<font color="#ffff00">I never should've left you there.</font>

1142
01:35:08,219 --> 01:35:10,758
<font color="#ffff00">I never should have
left you there.</font>

1143
01:35:17,243 --> 01:35:19,633
<font color="#ffff00">I can't trust you.</font>

1144
01:35:20,057 --> 01:35:22,986
<font color="#ffff00">I can't trust anybody!</font>

1145
01:35:31,547 --> 01:35:35,165
<font color="#ffff00">- Wonderful, kid.
- You can't stop me, Wade!</font>

1146
01:35:36,922 --> 01:35:38,937
<font color="#ffff00">I got one more idea.</font>

1147
01:35:39,516 --> 01:35:43,093
<font color="#ffff00">- It's just a really bad one, even for me.
- Wade, what are you doing?</font>

1148
01:35:43,117 --> 01:35:45,820
<font color="#ffff00">Alright, this is for
all the marbles, kid.</font>

1149
01:35:45,844 --> 01:35:48,195
<font color="#ffff00">You gonna trust someone tonight?</font>

1150
01:35:48,234 --> 01:35:51,702
<font color="#ffff00">- Blessed are the wicked...
- Then it's gotta be me.</font>

1151
01:35:52,697 --> 01:35:55,460
<font color="#ffff00">Who are healed by my hand!</font>

1152
01:37:00,817 --> 01:37:03,920
<font color="#ffff00">Tell me, they got
that in slow-motion.</font>

1153
01:37:08,431 --> 01:37:10,822
<font color="#ffff00">That's not good.</font>

1154
01:37:11,712 --> 01:37:13,391
<font color="#ffff00">No, sir.</font>

1155
01:37:20,724 --> 01:37:25,138
<font color="#ffff00">- You sacrificed yourself, for me?
- Yeah.</font>

1156
01:37:25,163 --> 01:37:27,663
<font color="#ffff00">And it was the best
thing I ever did.</font>

1157
01:37:29,436 --> 01:37:31,567
<font color="#ffff00">I told you I care about you.</font>

1158
01:37:31,592 --> 01:37:34,295
<font color="#ffff00">You're a good kid, Russell.</font>

1159
01:37:35,121 --> 01:37:36,315
<font color="#ffff00">Hey.</font>

1160
01:37:37,416 --> 01:37:40,339
<font color="#ffff00">The bear. It worked.</font>

1161
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:48,745
<font color="#ffff00">Because of you.</font>

1162
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:51,770
<font color="#ffff00">No, Wade. Because of you.</font>

1163

<font color="#ffff00">Stop. Stop! Stop. Stop.</font>

1164
01:37:55,108 --> 01:37:58,091
<font color="#ffff00">Just... Just let it happen.</font>

1165
01:37:58,116 --> 01:38:00,186
<font color="#ffff00">Okay? I guess...</font>

1166
01:38:00,211 --> 01:38:03,070
<font color="#ffff00">I guess my heart was finally
in the right place.</font>

1167
01:38:03,249 --> 01:38:05,788
<font color="#ffff00">That riddle is so fucked up.</font>

1168
01:38:10,072 --> 01:38:11,704
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry.</font>

1169
01:38:11,721 --> 01:38:13,564
<font color="#ffff00">- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.</font>

1170
01:38:13,604 --> 01:38:16,166
<font color="#ffff00">Don't be. I've been trying to
make this happen for a while.</font>

1171
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:19,634
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. Please, just, don't leave. I
don't wanna die without an audience.</font>

1172
01:38:19,651 --> 01:38:22,151
<font color="#ffff00">- We are not going anywhere.
- Oh, God.</font>

1173
01:38:22,175 --> 01:38:24,487
<font color="#ffff00">The Academy is watching.</font>

01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:06,677
<font color="#ffff00">I got a bit more in me.
Domino...</font>

1179

Adventure Time watch.</font>

1180
01:39:13,521 --> 01:39:16,903
<font color="#ffff00">Sounds like that
I'm the lucky one.</font>

1181
01:39:17,542 --> 01:39:19,286
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Hey, Sabrina the
teenage witch...</font>

1183

you, but you've always been that to me.</font>

1189
01:39:46,891 --> 01:39:51,438

It's no big deal. Here we go. 1, 2, 3...</font>

1190
01:39:53,281 --> 01:39:56,256
<font color="#ffff00">- Fuck.
- Wow. Enjoy hell.</font>

1192
01:40:01,952 --> 01:40:05,748

You tell them Wade says 'hi'.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">And promise me. Promise
me one thing...</font>

1194
01:40:10,075 --> 01:40:12,801
<font color="#ffff00">That you'll start judging people
not by the color of their skin</font>

1195
01:40:12,826 --> 01:40:15,232
<font color="#ffff00">but by the content

<font color="#ffff00">Family,</font>

1201
01:40:26,879 --> 01:40:30,137
<font color="#ffff00">is not an F-word, all right?</font>

1202
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:34,137
<font color="#ffff00">Just keep looking, okay?</font>

1203
01:40:36,944 --> 01:40:40,154
<font color="#ffff00">Guys? For a second there...</font>

1204
01:40:40,572 --> 01:40:43,891
<font color="#ffff00">We would've made a
pretty good team.</font>

1205

1206
01:41:01,176 --> 01:41:04,230
<font color="#ffff00">I just love being with
all you guys so much.</font>

1207
01:41:04,793 --> 01:41:06,652
<font color="#ffff00">So, so much.</font>

1208
01:41:08,084 --> 01:41:10,816
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, I can feel it now.
Here it comes. Yeah.</font>

1209
01:41:10,958 --> 01:41:14,810
<font color="#ffff00">Feel the soul,
exiting the husk...</font>

1210
01:41:17,761 --> 01:41:19,850
<font color="#ffff00">Can you see it?</font>

1211
01:41:20,356 --> 01:41:22,667
<font color="#ffff00">Do you see that
beautiful bright light?</font>

1212
01:41:23,573 --> 01:41:25,747
<font color="#ffff00">There it is.</font>

1213
01:41:31,282 --> 01:41:34,188
<font color="#ffff00">No, that's the sun. Don't
stare directly into that.</font>

1214
01:41:34,398 --> 01:41:36,538
<font color="#ffff00">I'd just like a
few final words...</font>

1219
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:10,212
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry I'm late. There
was a bunch of...</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Handicappable children
stuck in a tree. No.</font>

1225
01:43:24,786 --> 01:43:26,713
<font color="#ffff00">It is now.</font>

1226
01:43:29,575 --> 01:43:31,765
<font color="#ffff00">I'm so sorry.</font>

1227
01:43:32,277 --> 01:43:33,980
<font color="#ffff00">It's okay.</font>

1228
01:43:53,414 --> 01:43:56,148
<font color="#ffff00">I missed you so much.</font>

1229
01:44:01,076 --> 01:44:03,161
<font color="#ffff00">What is it? What's wrong?</font>

1230
01:44:04,061 --> 01:44:06,264
<font color="#ffff00">It's not time.</font>

1231
01:44:06,489 --> 01:44:08,645
<font color="#ffff00">What do you mean, it's not time?</font>

1232
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:10,412
<font color="#ffff00">I'm here. I made it.</font>

1233
01:44:10,437 --> 01:44:12,981
<font color="#ffff00">- You can't stay.
- No, no, no. I'm staying.</font>

1234
01:44:13,015 --> 01:44:15,029
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not going
anywhere without you.</font>

1235
01:44:15,054 --> 01:44:16,389
<font color="#ffff00">It's okay.</font>

1236
01:44:16,414 --> 01:44:19,242
<font color="#ffff00">There's a time for us.
It's just not now.</font>

1237
01:44:20,070 --> 01:44:22,945
<font color="#ffff00">- They need you.
- Who?</font>

1238
01:44:24,523 --> 01:44:26,327

1251
01:45:21,113 --> 01:45:22,372
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

1252
01:45:30,832 --> 01:45:32,441
<font color="#ffff00">Time to make the chimichangas.</font>

What's with the...</font>

1256
01:45:37,069 --> 01:45:39,162
<font color="#ffff00">That's my daughter's Teddy bear.</font>

1257

- Oh.</font>

1258
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:46,742
<font color="#ffff00">What are you doing?
Somebody swiped right.</font>

1259
01:45:58,965 --> 01:46:01,902
<font color="#ffff00">Tell me they got
that in slow-motion.</font>

- Hey, what's here? I...</font>

1261
01:46:10,471 --> 01:46:11,573
<font color="#ffff00">Huh.</font>

1262
01:46:12,377 --> 01:46:14,744
<font color="#ffff00">Genuine high-grade lead.</font>

1263
01:46:16,986 --> 01:46:19,931
<font color="#ffff00">You time-sliding son of a bitch.</font>

1264
01:46:19,956 --> 01:46:22,142
<font color="#ffff00">You did this for me?</font>

1265

<font color="#ffff00">Wait...</font>

1266

1267
01:46:26,517 --> 01:46:29,288
<font color="#ffff00">You used the last of your fuel.
What about your girl and wife?</font>

1268
01:46:29,313 --> 01:46:31,234
<font color="#ffff00">No, my family's safe.</font>

1269
01:46:31,259 --> 01:46:34,016
<font color="#ffff00">And I didn't do it for you.</font>

1270
01:46:34,313 --> 01:46:36,890
<font color="#ffff00">Now I'm gonna stick
around for a while.</font>

1271
01:46:36,915 --> 01:46:40,149
<font color="#ffff00">Make sure the world doesn't
shit itself into oblivion.</font>

1272

- I didn't.</font>

1274
01:46:47,102 --> 01:46:49,000
<font color="#ffff00">- Pretty sure you did.
- No, I'm positive I didn't.</font>

1275
01:46:49,025 --> 01:46:51,016
<font color="#ffff00">Fine. Alright. Let's
flip a coin, okay?</font>

1276
01:46:51,041 --> 01:46:53,821
<font color="#ffff00">Heads, did it for me,
tails, you did it for me.</font>

1277
01:46:53,846 --> 01:46:56,666
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not even gonna look
because you did it for me.</font>

1278

<font color="#ffff00">- Say it again.
- You did it for me.</font>

1279

<font color="#ffff00">- Jesus.
- We must get the collar off.</font>

1280
01:46:59,813 --> 01:47:02,672
<font color="#ffff00">Forget it. It's no use. These
collars don't just come off.</font>

1281
01:47:02,697 --> 01:47:06,141
<font color="#ffff00">Wade... I have an idea.</font>

1282
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:08,770
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, no, no, no, no. Let's
not do that, please.</font>

1283
01:47:08,786 --> 01:47:11,826
<font color="#ffff00">I'd rather die of cancer.
That's just... Oh, God.</font>

1284
01:47:11,851 --> 01:47:14,577
<font color="#ffff00">They do say, the pen is
grosser than the sword.</font>

- Settle down, Captain Lucky.</font>

1287
01:47:20,358 --> 01:47:23,568

God, that's lazy writing.</font>

1288
01:47:23,857 --> 01:47:25,778
<font color="#ffff00">Still got it.</font>

1289
01:47:28,226 --> 01:47:30,929
<font color="#ffff00">Put that back in
your prison wallet.</font>

1290

but I do know how to hug you.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">- No.
- Yes. Here we go.</font>

1292
01:47:38,136 --> 01:47:41,549
<font color="#ffff00">Bring it in. Come on.
Pelvis to pelvis.</font>

1293
01:47:41,651 --> 01:47:45,697
