2
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:05,157
The IMF is uniquely trained

3
00:00:05,323 --> 00:00:06,466
and highly motivated.

4
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:12,277
Specialists without equal
immune to any countermeasures.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,995
But it is an agency of chaos.

6
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:18,956
The time has come
to dissolve the IMF.

7
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:21,477
Now, I want you to choose
your next words very carefully.

8
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:24,197
Where is Hunt?

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,917
Last I heard,
he was tracking the Syndicate.

10
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:32,677
How come the CIA hs never discovered
any intel regarding the Syndicate?

11
00:00:32,843 --> 00:00:34,797
Do you want the polite answer,
or the truth?

12
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:43,717
We've never met before, right?

13
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:44,576
Follow me!

14
00:00:49,923 --> 00:00:51,394
- Benji.
- Ethan! Where are you?

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,794
The Syndicate is real.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,637
A rogue nation
trained to do what we do.

17
00:00:55,803 --> 00:00:56,797
An anti-IMF.

18
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:01,997
They're coming after us
with everything they've got.

19
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:03,363
Are you ready?

20
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:08,929
This may very well be
our last mission.

21
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:10,616
Let's make it count.

22
00:01:11,443 --> 00:01:12,943
So, what's the play?

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,357
You want to bring down the Syndicate?

24
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:20,877
It's impossible.

25
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,157
How do you know we can trust her?

26
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:42,437
Desperate times...

27
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:44,637
Desperate measures.

28
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:49,272
- You have your seat belt on?
- You're asking me that now?!

29
00:01:51,186 --> 00:01:52,917
Oh, hey, boys!
What did I miss?

30
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:57,381
Ethan?

31
00:01:59,003 --> 00:01:59,698
Benji!

32
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,197
Open the door!

33
00:02:02,683 --> 00:02:04,637
- Open the door!
- Yeah, I'm trying!

34
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,411
Oh, my God!

35
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:14,957
The other door!
