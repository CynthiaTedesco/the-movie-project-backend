1
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,474
Head cocked to the left...

2
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,434
...partial deafness in ear.

3
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,852
First point of attack.

4
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,649
Two, throat. Paralyze vocal cords.
Stop screaming.

5
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,820
Three, got to be heavy drinker.
Floating rib to the liver.

6
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,365
Four, finally, dragging left leg.
Fist to patella.

7
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,035
Summary of prognosis,
conscious in 90 seconds.

8
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,912
Martial efficacy, quarter of an hour.

9
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,665
Full faculty recovery, unlikely.

10
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,239
I like the hat.

11
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,908
I just picked it up.

12
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,826
Did you remember your revolver?

13
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,244
Knew I forgot something.

14
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,623
- Thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.

15
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,085
I think that's quite enough.

16
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,087
You are a doctor, after all.

17
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,803
Always nice to see you, Watson.

18
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,183
Where's the inspector?

19
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,602
He's getting his troops lined up.

20
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,103
That could be all day.

21
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,955
Sherlock Holmes.

22
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,458
And his loyal dog.

23
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,377
Tell me, doctor...

24
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,380
...as a medical man,
have you enjoyed my work?

25
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,133
Let me show you
how much I've enjoyed it.

26
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,468
Watson. Don't.

27
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,349
Observe.

28
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,104
How did you see that?

29
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,647
Because I was looking for it.

30
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,571
Lord Blackwood.

31
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,906
You seem surprised.

32
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,577
I'd say the girl deserves your attention
more than he.

33
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,538
Indeed.

34
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,421
Oh, I'd leave that alone
if I were you, boy-o.

35
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,590
Good lad.

36
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,009
Impeccable timing, Lestrade.

37
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,762
We've one for the doctor...

38
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,430
...and one for the rope.

39
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,390
- Clarkie?
- Sir?

40
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,434
This woman needs a hospital
immediately.

41
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,227
Put her in the back of the Moriah.

42
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,604
Right, lads. That's it.

43
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,735
- Right. Pick him up, lads.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,820
If you don't mind.

45
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,740
Get him out of my sight.

46
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,456
And you were supposed to
wait for my orders.

47
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,878
If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse
and chasing a rumor.

48
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,964
Besides, the girl's parents hired me,
not the Yard.

49
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,967
Why they thought you'd require
any assistance is beyond me.

50
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,804
Well, London will breathe a sigh of relief.

51
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,139
Indeed. Congratulations, Lestrade.

52
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,975
Bravo, inspector. Have a cigar.

53
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,477
Gentlemen.

54
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,853
Cheese.

55
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,677
Blackwood hangs tomorrow.
Read all about it.

56
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,685
156 over 80. Very good.

57
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,313
My nerves are the best they've been
in years, thanks to you.

58
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,898
Tell me something.

59
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,067
Your new premises...

60
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,485
...when are you moving in?

61
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,487
I should be in within the week.

62
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:31,032
Cavendish Place.
And there'll be a woman's touch too.

63
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,534
- Well, that's marvelous.
- Indeed.

64
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,246
Good God.

65
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,332
- That was gunfire.
- No.

66
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,586
No, no. Hammer and nail, wasn't it?

67
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:46,006
My colleague's probably
just putting up a painting.

68
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,383
I'll... I'll go and check.

69
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,510
- Your colleague...
- Yes?

70
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,054
Won't be moving with you, will he?

71
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,348
No, he won't.

72
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,102
Mrs. Hudson.

73
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,855
I won't go in,
not while he's got a gun in his hand.

74
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,732
You don't have to. Give me the paper.

75
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,485
What'll I do when you leave, doctor?
He'll have the whole house down.

76
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,529
He just needs another case. That's all.

77
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,781
Couldn't you have a longer engagement?

78
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,368
I smell gunpowder. It's not right, you know,
not in a domestic environment.

79
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,040
Thank you, Captain Philips.
Perhaps a nice cup of tea?

80
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,835
- Same time next week.
- Come along, captain.

81
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,254
- It's quieter downstairs.
- Mrs. Hudson?

82
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,923
Bring something to cheer him up.

83
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,393
Permission to enter the armory?

84
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,603
Granted.

85
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,525
Watson, I am in the process
of inventing a device...

86
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,694
...that suppresses the sound
of a gunshot.

87
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,033
It's not working.

88
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,826
Can I see that?

89
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,128
You know, it's been three months...

90
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,589
...since your last case.

91
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,594
Yes, yes. Gently, gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me...

92
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,225
Don't you think it's time
you found another one?

93
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,645
I can't but agree.

94
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,399
My mind rebels at stagnation.
Give me problems. Give me work.

95
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:29,192
The sooner, the better.

96
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,111
Paper.

97
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,990
Let's see, then. There's a letter here...

98
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:38,451
...from Mrs. Ramsey of Queen's Park.

99
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,163
- Her husband's disappeared.
- He's in Belgium with the scullery maid.

100
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,957
Is it November?

101
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,751
Yes, Holmes. All right.

102
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,713
Lady Radford reports...

103
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,090
Oh, her emerald bracelet
has disappeared.

104
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,553
Insurance swindle. Lord Radford
likes fast women and slow ponies.

105
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,432
Oh. I see you're the attending physician
at Blackwood's hanging.

106
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,641
Yes.

107
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,395
It was our last case together
and I wanted to see it through to the end.

108
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,737
A Mr. Lewis is seeking...

109
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,614
There's only one case
that intrigues me at present:

110
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,869
The curious case of Mrs. Hudson,
the absentee landlady.

111
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,079
I've been studying
her comings and goings.

112
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,373
They appear most sinister.

113
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,208
Tea, Mr. Holmes?

114
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,668
Is it poisoned, nanny?

115
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,171
There's enough of that in you already.

116
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,882
Don't touch.
Everything is in its proper place...

117
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,384
...as per usual, nanny.

118
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,721
He's killed the dog. Again.

119
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,265
What have you done to Gladstone now?

120
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,560
I was simply testing a new anesthetic.

121
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,395
He doesn't mind.

122
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,649
Holmes, as your doctor...

123
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:56,029
- He'll be as right as a trivet in no time.
- As your friend...

124
00:10:56,197 --> 00:11:00,241
...you've been in this room for two weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.

125
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:04,496
There's nothing of interest for me
out there, on earth, at all.

126
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,249
- You're free this evening?
- Absolutely.

127
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,668
- Dinner? The Royale?
- Wonderful. My favorite.

128
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,379
Mary's coming.

129
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,466
- Not available.
- You're meeting her, Holmes.

130
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,511
Have you proposed yet?

131
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,723
- No, I haven't found the right ring.
- Then it's not official.

132
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,017
It's happening, whether you like it or not.

133
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,269
8:30, the Royale. Wear a jacket.

134
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,979
You wear a jacket.

135
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,371
A man? Outside my house?

136
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,879
Straighten your tie.

137
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,642
- Holmes.
- Mm.

138
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:09,769
You're early.

139
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,647
Fashionably.

140
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,816
Miss Mary Morstan.

141
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,318
My goodness. What a pleasure.

142
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:21,114
I don't know why it's taken him so long
to introduce us properly.

143
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,657
Pleasure is mine.

144
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,915
It really is quite a thrill to meet you,
Mr. Holmes.

145
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,042
I've heard so much about you.

146
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,545
I have a pile of detective novels at home.

147
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,922
- Wilkie Collins, Poe.
- It's true.

148
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,592
It can seem a little far-fetched
though sometimes...

149
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,511
...making grand assumptions
out of tiny details.

150
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,471
That's not quite right, is it?

151
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,600
In fact, the little details
are by far the most important.

152
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,480
- Take Watson.
- I intend to.

153
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,069
See his walking stick?
A rare African snakewood...

154
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,697
...hiding a blade of high-tensile steel.

155
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,326
A few were awarded
to veterans of the Afghan war...

156
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:08,536
...so I can assume
he's a decorated soldier.

157
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,706
Strong, brave,
born to be a man of action.

158
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,542
And neat, like all military men.

159
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,670
Now, I check his pockets.

160
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:23,218
Ah. A stub from a boxing match.
Now I can infer that he's a bit of a gambler.

161
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,053
I'd keep an eye on that dowry.

162
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,555
- Those days are behind me.
- Right behind you.

163
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,557
He's cost us the rent more than once.

164
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,394
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
you know John very well.

165
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,064
What about a complete stranger?

166
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,983
- What can you tell about me?
- You?

167
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,735
- I don't think...
- I don't know that...

168
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,028
- Not at dinner.
- Some other time.

169
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,321
- I insist.
- You insist?

170
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,574
- You remember we discussed this.
- The lady insists.

171
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,457
- You're a governess.
- Well done.

172
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,251
Yes, well done. Shall we?

173
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,711
- Waiter?
- Your student...

174
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,213
...is a boy of 8.

175
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,258
- Charlie's 7, actually.
- Charlie, huh?

176
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,261
Then he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.

177
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,012
Is there ink on my face?

178
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,098
There's nothing wrong with your face.

179
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,225
There are two drops on your ear, in fact.

180
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,560
India blue's nearly impossible
to wash off.

181
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,354
A very impetuous act by the boy.

182
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,648
But you're too experienced
to react rashly...

183
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,609
...which is why the lady for whom you work
lent you that.

184
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:26,281
Oriental pearls, diamonds, a flawless ruby.
Hardly the gems of a governess.

185
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,287
The jewels you are not wearing
tell us more.

186
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,789
- Holmes.
- You were engaged.

187
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,417
The ring is gone,
but the lighter skin suggests...

188
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:40,295
...that you spent some time abroad
wearing it proudly...

189
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,964
...until you were informed
of its true, modest worth.

190
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,799
You broke off the engagement...

191
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,802
...and returned to England
for better prospects.

192
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,596
A doctor, perhaps.

193
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,230
Right on all counts, Mr. Holmes,
apart from one.

194
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,152
I didn't leave him.

195
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,987
He died.

196
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,498
Well done, old boy.

197
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,120
- Fight. Fight.
- Get him.

198
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,241
Get up and fight.

199
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,537
Fight.

200
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:39,205
- Finish it.
- Come on.

201
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,380
Get up and fight, come on.

202
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,590
Come on.

203
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,176
Get up.

204
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,514
Get up and fight.

205
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,231
That's it, big man, we're done.

206
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,316
You won, congratulations.

207
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,402
We ain't done yet.

208
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,452
This mustn't register
on an emotional level.

209
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,288
First, distract target.

210
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,249
Then block his blind jab.

211
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,294
Counter with cross to left cheek.

212
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:29,630
Discombobulate.

213
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,674
Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker.

214
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,969
Employ elbow block, and body shot.

215
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,473
Block feral left. Weaken right jaw.

216
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,101
Now fracture.

217
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,480
Break cracked ribs.

218
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,315
Traumatize solar plexus.

219
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,275
Dislocate jaw entirely.

220
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,489
Heel kick to diaphragm.

221
00:17:56,533 --> 00:18:00,953
In summary, ears ringing, jaw fractured,
three ribs cracked, four broken...

222
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,915
...diaphragm hemorrhaging,
physical recovery, six weeks...

223
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,918
...full psychological recovery,
six months...

224
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:09,337
...capacity to spit at back of head...

225
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,047
...neutralized.

226
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,077
Where did that come from?

227
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,410
What the hell's going on here, Charlie?

228
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:25,121
Lord Blackwood's put him
under some kind of spell, sir.

229
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,040
It's like he's burning from the inside out.

230
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,421
You lot, shut up!

231
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,423
Charlie. Charlie!

232
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,717
Take this man to the infirmary, now.

233
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,606
What's this all about, then, Blackwood?

234
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,946
There's someone I want to see.

235
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,635
- Watson?
- Right.

236
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,471
Let's go.

237
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,057
What started merely as an experiment...

238
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:29,143
...has brought me to the threshold
of a monumental discovery.

239
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,271
Now, if I play a chromatic scale...

240
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,732
...there's no measurable response.

241
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,651
You do know what you're drinking
is meant for eye surgery?

242
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,153
But, now...

243
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,654
...and this is remarkable...

244
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,450
...if I change to atonal clusters...

245
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,955
...voilà, they fly in counterclockwise,
synchronized concentric circles...

246
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,707
...as though a regimented flock.

247
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,501
Watson, this is exceptional.

248
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:58,464
I, using musical theory,
have created order out of chaos.

249
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,258
How did you lure them in?

250
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,135
Excellent question.

251
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,180
Individually. I've been at it for six hours.

252
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,016
- And what happens if I do this?
- What?

253
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,687
- Right.
- Clean yourself up.

254
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,315
You are Blackwood's last request.

255
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:30,788
Look at those towering structures.

256
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,251
It's the first combination of bascule
and suspension bridge ever attempted.

257
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,336
Most innovative.

258
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,715
What an industrious empire.

259
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,676
Hm?

260
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,387
Oh, I have your winnings from last night.

261
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,599
You weren't there,
so I made your customary bet.

262
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:56,480
Right. I'll keep it with your checkbook,
locked safely away in my drawer.

263
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,318
Did you know the opera house
is featuring Don Giovanni?

264
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:06,073
I could procure a couple of tickets if you
had any cultural inclinations this evening.

265
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:11,579
You have the grand gift of silence,
Watson.

266
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:14,373
It makes you quite invaluable
as a companion.

267
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,128
I knew she'd been engaged.

268
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,421
She had told me.

269
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,256
So that's no to the opera, then?

270
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,057
- That was my waistcoat.
- We agreed it's too small for you.

271
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,726
- I'd like it back.
- We agreed.

272
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,394
I want it back.

273
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,304
This way, Mr. Holmes.

274
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,434
Blackwood certainly seems to have got
the crowd into something of a fear frenzy.

275
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:19,063
Which I'm certain will disperse
once his feet have stopped twitching.

276
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,731
Care to come along?

277
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,193
No, old cock.
I've no business with him whilst he's alive.

278
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,654
Suit yourself, mother hen.

279
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,752
It seems you have lots of rooms to let.

280
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,714
We had to move the prisoners, sir.
Otherwise we were gonna have a riot.

281
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:49,176
He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.

282
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,928
As though...

283
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,431
...he can get inside their heads.

284
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,437
I can find my own way
if you have other duties to perform.

285
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,357
Much obliged, sir. Thank you, sir.

286
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:08,028
If any man have an ear, let him hear.

287
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,073
I stood upon the sand of the sea
and saw a beast rise up...

288
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,992
...having seven heads and 10 horns.

289
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,452
Upon his heads were
the name of blasphemy.

290
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,871
They worshiped the dragon,
which gave power.

291
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,624
They worshiped, saying,
"Who is like unto the beast?"

292
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,668
The beast which I saw
was like a leopard.

293
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,504
His feet were of a bear,
his mouth was of a lion...

294
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:29,300
...and the dragon gave him his power
and his seat and great authority.

295
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,760
I love what you've done with the place.

296
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,723
So glad you could accept my invitation.

297
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,934
I just have a small point of concern.

298
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,521
- How can I help?
- I'd followed the murders with interest.

299
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,524
While my heart went out
to the families of the victims...

300
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:49,653
...I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery
in the stroke of your brush.

301
00:24:49,904 --> 00:24:52,239
- You're too kind.
- However, by comparison...

302
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:56,243
...your work in the crypt
was more akin to a finger painting.

303
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,958
So now you're curious
as to whether there's a larger game afoot.

304
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,794
Either that or, um...

305
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:09,840
...shortly my friend will pronounce you dead
and I thought I might keep him company.

306
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,427
Your mistake is to imagine that
anything earthly's led to this moment.

307
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:17,598
Your error of judgment is to assume
that I'm holding the brush at all.

308
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,310
- I'm merely the channel.
- My only wish is that I caught you sooner.

309
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,271
You see,
five lives might have been spared.

310
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,441
Mm. Those lives were a necessity.

311
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,942
Hm.

312
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,778
Sacrifice.

313
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,239
Five meaningless creatures
called to serve a greater purpose.

314
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,825
I wonder if they'd let Watson and me
dissect your brain.

315
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,744
After you're hanged, of course.

316
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,749
I'd wager there's some deformity
that'd be scientifically significant.

317
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,544
Then you, too,
could serve a greater purpose.

318
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,799
Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze.

319
00:25:51,966 --> 00:25:56,804
I'm concerned you underestimate
the gravity of coming events.

320
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,640
You and I are bound together
on a journey...

321
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,393
...that will twist the very fabric of nature.

322
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:07,022
But beneath your mask of logic,
I sense a fragility.

323
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,274
That worries me.

324
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,778
Steel your mind, Holmes.

325
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,446
I need you.

326
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:17,032
You've come a long way down
from the House of Lords.

327
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,784
- And I will rise again.
- Bon voyage.

328
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,619
Pay attention.

329
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:24,123
Three more will die, and there is
nothing you can do to save them.

330
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,334
You must accept
that this is beyond your control...

331
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:31,046
...or, by the time you realize you
made all of this possible...

332
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:34,466
...it'll be the last sane thought
in your head.

333
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,559
What did he want?

334
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,310
Not sure.

335
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,439
But I don't think you're needed, Father.
Not for this one.

336
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,192
Lord Henry Blackwood...

337
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,780
...you are sentenced to death
for the practice of black magic...

338
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:00,284
...the unholy murder of five
innocent young women...

339
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,870
...and the attempted murder of a sixth.

340
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,539
Do you have any final words?

341
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,167
Death...

342
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,378
...is only the beginning.

343
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,641
Forever and ever. Amen.

344
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:49,249
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.

345
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,607
London's so bleak this time of year.

346
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,444
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.

347
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,113
I much prefer to travel in the winter.

348
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,744
Here, I brought you these,
all the way from Syria.

349
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,789
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...

350
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,958
...and your favorite...

351
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,502
...olives from the Cyclades.

352
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,921
Thought we might have a little tea party.

353
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,550
And while I was setting the table,
I found this:

354
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,802
A file with my name on it.

355
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,972
"Theft of Velázquez portrait
from king of Spain."

356
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,977
"Missing naval documents lead
to resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."

357
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:55,148
"Scandalous affair ends engagement of...

358
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,737
...Hapsburg prince
to Romanov princess."

359
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,825
I was simply studying your methods...

360
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,952
...should the authorities
ask me to hunt you down.

361
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,662
Ah.

362
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,998
But I don't see my name
in any of these articles.

363
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:12,958
But your signature was clear.

364
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,587
Is that the maharajah's
missing diamond?

365
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,965
Or just another souvenir?

366
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,676
Let's not dwell on the past.

367
00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:25,888
Shall we?

368
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,183
By the looks of things,
you're between jobs.

369
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:33,604
And you between husbands.
How much did you get for the ring?

370
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:37,691
He was boring and jealous,
and he snored.

371
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,487
I'm Irene Adler again.

372
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,330
Thank you.

373
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,879
I need your help.

374
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,840
I need you to find someone.

375
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,886
Why are you always so suspicious?

376
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,555
Shall I answer chronologically
or alphabetically?

377
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:12,726
Careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope.

378
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,690
I think you'll find all the information
you need inside.

379
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,693
Who are you working for?

380
00:30:23,237 --> 00:30:25,072
So I'll have to find out the hard way?

381
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,575
Keep your money.
I didn't say I'll take the case.

382
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,244
Well, consider it a wager that you will.

383
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,373
Do you remember The Grand?

384
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,750
They gave me our old room.

385
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,515
Hold the door.

386
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,558
Thanks, doctor.

387
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,624
Ma'am.

388
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:24,506
- He'll do it.
- Well done, Miss Adler.

389
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,426
That's precisely why I hired you.

390
00:31:28,594 --> 00:31:31,179
I wager he'll have our man
within the next 24 hours.

391
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,931
He'd better.

392
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,308
Reordan is the key
to what Blackwood was doing.

393
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,145
He's essential to my plan.

394
00:31:38,312 --> 00:31:40,480
Get off out of it.

395
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,275
What you doing?
Can't you see where you're going?

396
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,444
- You scalp diver.
- Get off out of it.

397
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,156
A little rifle range
would go a long way, sir...

398
00:31:49,323 --> 00:31:52,701
...rubbing the calluses
off these German bands.

399
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,786
God save the queen.

400
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,247
God save the queen, sir.

401
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,749
Get off out of it.

402
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,212
Look at you.

403
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,424
Why is the only woman
you've cared about a criminal?

404
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,633
Are you a masochist?

405
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,886
- Allow me to explain.
- Allow me.

406
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,848
She's the only adversary
who ever outsmarted you. Twice.

407
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,683
Made a proper idiot out of you.

408
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,478
- Right, you've had your fun.
- What's she after, anyway?

409
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:22,105
- It's time to press on.
- What could she possibly need?

410
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,690
It doesn't matter.

411
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,985
An alibi? A beard? A human canoe.

412
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,988
She could sit on your back
and paddle you up the Thames.

413
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,240
That's of no consequence to you, is it?

414
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,367
We've done our last case together.

415
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,119
I've already read it.

416
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,997
Missing person:

417
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,167
Luke Reordan, 4 foot 10,
red hair, no front teeth.

418
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,376
Case solved.

419
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,838
You're obviously not her type.
She likes ginger dwarves.

420
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,632
- Midget.
- So you agree?

421
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,050
No, I don't agree.

422
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,803
It's more than technicality, you see.

423
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,056
You're misrepresenting the dimensions
of foreshortened peoples.

424
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,726
- I've said too much. I've upset you.
- No, I am simply stating that one has...

425
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,394
What were you doing?

426
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,189
- Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.

427
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:30,257
- Holmes. What are you doing?
- Nothing.

428
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,093
- Are you wearing a false...?
- False nose? No.

429
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,679
- Tell me that that wasn't...
- That wasn't.

430
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,683
Holmes. Where are you going?

431
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,105
Watson.

432
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,525
Watson.

433
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:11,381
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.
Cut you a deal because you're so pretty.

434
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:15,427
Oh. My lucky day.

435
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,471
Hello, gorgeous.
You got something for me?

436
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,935
Don't move.

437
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,982
Now, what have we got here?

438
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,484
It's...

439
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,531
Thank you.

440
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,618
That's the Irene I know.

441
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,335
Good boy.

442
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,172
This man intrigues me, Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.

443
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,716
- Which is no mean feat.
- She's intimidated.

444
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,051
She's scared of him.

445
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,386
Yet she works for him.

446
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,931
- Right.
- It's nothing to do with me...

447
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,850
...but I advise you leave the case alone.

448
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,560
Well, I may not have a choice.

449
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,856
After all, I may be paying the rent
on my own soon, thanks to you.

450
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,901
- Get that out of my face.
- It's not. It's in my hand.

451
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,403
Get what's in your hand out of my face.

452
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,862
- Mr. Holmes?
- Clarkie.

453
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,157
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks
that you come with me at once.

454
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,994
What's he done now,
lost his way to Scotland Yard?

455
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:06,246
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."

456
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,914
No, "you" means you.

457
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,500
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He, uh...

458
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,002
Well...

459
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,463
...it appears he's come back
from the grave, sir.

460
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:26,224
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.

461
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,268
I pronounced the man dead myself.

462
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,688
What are the facts?

463
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,108
Groundskeeper saw him walking
through the graveyard this morning.

464
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,986
I'll leave this in your capable hands.

465
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:42,741
- I have an appointment with Mary.
- It's not my reputation that's at stake here.

466
00:36:42,908 --> 00:36:44,451
Don't try that.

467
00:36:44,618 --> 00:36:47,871
- The newspapers got wind of it?
- That's what we're trying to avoid.

468
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,622
Certainly.

469
00:36:49,915 --> 00:36:51,249
What's the major concern?

470
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,877
Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.

471
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,921
- Indeed.
- You're not taking this seriously, are you?

472
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,590
Yes, as you should.

473
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,635
It's a matter of professional integrity.

474
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,765
No girl wants to marry a doctor
who can't tell if a man's dead or not.

475
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,116
Who do you think won the match,
Clarkie?

476
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,702
- Sir?
- The rugby match.

477
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,998
Your boys have done a magnificent job
obliterating any potential evidence.

478
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:36,169
Yes. But at least they never miss
an opportunity to miss an opportunity.

479
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,174
You took your time, Holmes.

480
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,511
"And on the third day"...

481
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,307
These slabs are half a ton each
if they're a pound...

482
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,559
...and they're smashed open
from the inside.

483
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,354
Lestrade, what of the coffin?

484
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,857
- We are in the process of bringing it up.
- I see.

485
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:03,113
Hm. Right. At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?

486
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:07,450
Anyhow, where's our witness?

487
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,910
He's over there.

488
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,246
And apparently, he is cata...

489
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,455
Cat...

490
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,124
Catatonic, sir.

491
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,210
- He's not feeling very well.
- Yes.

492
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:23,216
If you lot don't stop behaving like quivering
milkmaids, you're on double-time.

493
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,886
Now, you get down there
and you bring that coffin up now.

494
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,472
Good day, sir.

495
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,058
Hello.

496
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,811
It's all right.

497
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,688
I'm a doctor.

498
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,325
The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.

499
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,164
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.

500
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,790
Well?

501
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:59,085
- Well?
- You pronounced him dead.

502
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,754
He had no pulse.

503
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,094
Ready.

504
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,430
Down.

505
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,943
Good Lord.

506
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,113
That's not Blackwood.

507
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:32,118
Well, now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious.

508
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,124
Time of death?

509
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,670
Diptera is...

510
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,340
...approximately...

511
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:49,093
...two thirds of an inch
which would put the time of death...

512
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,304
...at between 10 and 12 hours ago.

513
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,806
May I borrow your pen?

514
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:00,897
- Adler's dwarf.
- Midget.

515
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,116
I know what I saw.

516
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,328
It was Blackwood.

517
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,957
As clear as I see you.

518
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,419
And when the dead walk...

519
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,173
...the living will fill these coffins.

520
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,636
Well, um...

521
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:37,809
Right.
Put the lid on and clean this lot up.

522
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,019
You really believe he was resurrected?

523
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,188
The question is not if, but how.

524
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,357
- The game's afoot.
- Follow your spirit...

525
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,234
And upon this charge, cry:

526
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,779
"God for Harry, England and St. George."

527
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,574
There you are.

528
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:56,327
Why that certain chips stall,
I don't understand.

529
00:40:56,495 --> 00:41:00,707
There's a particular beer in their batter.
A northern stout, to be exact.

530
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,669
You know, Holmes,
I've seen things in war I don't understand.

531
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,130
I once met a man
who predicted his own death...

532
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,632
...right down to the number
and the placement...

533
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,051
...of the bullets that killed him.

534
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,803
You have to admit, Holmes...

535
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,597
...that a supernatural explanation
to this case...

536
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,891
...is theoretically possible.

537
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:24,063
Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake
to theorize before one has data.

538
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,983
Inevitably one begins to twist facts
to suit theories...

539
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,360
...instead of theories to suit facts.

540
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:33,406
That said, I believe Adler's midget
is the key to this.

541
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,907
Hm.

542
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,244
Right. Scratches around
the keyhole where the watch was wound.

543
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,039
- What does that tell you?
- The man was likely a drunk.

544
00:41:41,206 --> 00:41:44,584
Every time he wound the watch
his hand would slip, hence the scratches.

545
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,793
Very good, Watson.

546
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:49,672
You've developed considerable
deductive powers of your own. Hm.

547
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,592
Let's see now, there are several
sets of initials scored...

548
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,302
- Pawnbrokers' marks.
- Excellent.

549
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,765
Most recent of which are "M.H."
M.H. M.H. Is for?

550
00:41:58,932 --> 00:42:01,476
- Maddison and Haig.
- Maddison and Haig.

551
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,607
They should be able to
give us an address.

552
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,321
What a coincidence.

553
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,949
There's one thing you've
failed to deduce from the watch.

554
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,534
Really? I think not.

555
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,913
The time. I have to get back, Holmes.

556
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,956
Taking tea with the in-laws.

557
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,417
- Reckon your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.

558
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,128
- No, thank you.
- You need to hear what I have to tell.

559
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,631
We have no need of your lucky heather,
gypsy woman.

560
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,050
Even if it's to do with Mary?

561
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,473
Oh. Oh.

562
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,643
I see two men. Brothers.

563
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,645
Not in blood, but in bond.

564
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,025
What of Mary?

565
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:54,987
M for Mary, for marriage.
Oh, you will be married.

566
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:57,156
Go on.

567
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,535
I see patterned tablecloths...

568
00:43:00,702 --> 00:43:03,162
...and, oh, china figurines...

569
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,289
...and, oh, lace doilies.

570
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:06,999
Doilies.

571
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,670
Lace doilies? Holmes.

572
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,132
Does your depravity know no bounds?

573
00:43:14,299 --> 00:43:16,134
- No.
- Oh, she turns to fat...

574
00:43:16,301 --> 00:43:18,136
...and, oh, she has a beard and...

575
00:43:18,303 --> 00:43:20,471
- What of the warts?
- She's covered in warts.

576
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,265
- Enough.
- Are they extensive?

577
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,350
Please, enough.

578
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:28,688
It's the most apt prediction
Flora has made in years.

579
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,233
And precisely the reason
you can't find a suitable ring.

580
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,484
Do you have my money?

581
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,195
You are terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre.

582
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,448
- Do you have my cut from the fight?
- Admit it.

583
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:40,700
- Give me my money! Holmes.
- Admit it!

584
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,412
I see.

585
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,919
Thank you.

586
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:57,717
Well, you've got your ring and
I've got my address for the ginger midget.

587
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:01,387
- Should be just there.
- I think she'll really like this.

588
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:05,308
And I have some change in my pocket.

589
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:12,231
- Shall I look after it for you?
- No, no.

590
00:44:13,066 --> 00:44:14,984
- Don't give it away here.
- No.

591
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,153
I have to go see Mary.

592
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,238
Give her my best.

593
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,158
And her family, as well.

594
00:45:02,115 --> 00:45:04,283
It does make a considerable
difference to me...

595
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,036
...having someone with me
on whom I can thoroughly rely.

596
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,706
Well, you can rely on me
for exactly 10 minutes.

597
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,294
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

598
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,338
Something did.

599
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,091
Irene Adler was here.

600
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,345
Either that or the ginger midget
wore the same Parisian perfume.

601
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,642
Ah. Putrefaction.

602
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,984
Ammonium sulfate, among other aromas.

603
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,823
Phosphorous.

604
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,492
Formaldehyde.

605
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:00,339
It looks like...

606
00:46:01,174 --> 00:46:03,426
...he was attempting to combine...

607
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,971
...some kind of sorcery
and scientific formula.

608
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,856
More importantly...

609
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,984
...let's see what he was
trying to dispose of.

610
00:46:21,194 --> 00:46:23,779
- Potassium, magnesium.
- Sultaphytic acid.

611
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:27,908
It'll suck the iron right out of the ink
as long as it's not too burnt.

612
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,216
Peculiar.

613
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,971
Hydrated rhododendron.

614
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,248
- Holmes.
- Hm?

615
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,917
Look at the crest.

616
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,836
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

617
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,755
Of course he was.

618
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,216
The question is, to what end.

619
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,431
Whatever he was working on,
he clearly succeeded.

620
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:33,933
How so?

621
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,310
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.

622
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:39,105
Which is why Miss Adler
is so desperate to find him.

623
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,773
Yes.

624
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,942
There is one odor
I can't quite put my finger on.

625
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,445
- Mm?
- Is it candy floss? Molasses?

626
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,988
Maple syrup?

627
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,281
Barley sugar.

628
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,200
Toffee apple.

629
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,290
Let me guess.

630
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,584
Judging by your arsonist tool kit...

631
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:04,714
...you're here to burn down the building
and extinguish all evidence therein.

632
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:07,133
Just one minute, boys.

633
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,093
Oh, Dredger.

634
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,114
Meat...

635
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,657
...or potatoes?

636
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,034
My 10 minutes are up.

637
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,881
You all right?

638
00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:46,292
Holmes...

639
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,252
...what is that?

640
00:50:50,463 --> 00:50:51,964
DREDGER:

641
00:51:53,151 --> 00:52:09,249
HOLMES:

642
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:17,586
Holmes!

643
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,724
Watson...

644
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,352
...what have you done?

645
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,323
I haven't slept all night.

646
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,492
Not a wink.

647
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,329
Why I ever believed...

648
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:38,250
...that I would get to have tea
with Mary's parents is beyond me...

649
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:42,629
...having been talked into going with you.
- We were set upon. It was self-defense.

650
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:47,050
I've been reviewing my notes
on our exploits over the last seven months.

651
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,011
Would you like to know my conclusion?

652
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,514
- I am psychologically disturbed.
- How so?

653
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:56,852
Why else would I continually be
led into situations...

654
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:01,607
...where you deliberately withhold
your plans from me? Why else?

655
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,777
You've never complained
about my methods before.

656
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:08,238
- I'm not complaining.
- What do you call this?

657
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,282
How am I complaining? I never complain.

658
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,368
Do I complain about you practicing
the violin in the morning...

659
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:17,748
...or your mess, your lack of hygiene,
or the fact that you steal my clothes?

660
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,124
We have a barter system.

661
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,627
Do I complain
about you setting fire to my rooms?

662
00:56:21,794 --> 00:56:22,836
- Our rooms.
- The rooms.

663
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:25,631
When do I complain
that you experiment on my dog?

664
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:26,965
- Our dog.
- On the dog.

665
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,592
Gladstone is our dog.

666
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,805
Where I do take issue is your campaign
to sabotage my relationship with Mary.

667
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,856
I understand.

668
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,733
- Do you?
- I do.

669
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,362
- I don't think you do.
- You're overtired.

670
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,489
- Yes.
- You're feeling sensitive.

671
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,823
I'm not sensitive.

672
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,201
What you need is a rest.

673
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,037
My brother, Mycroft,
has a small estate near Chichester.

674
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:01,625
Beautiful grounds. There's a folly.
We can throw a lamb on the spit.

675
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:05,587
We? Holmes, if I were to go to the country,
it would be with my future wife.

676
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,840
- Well, certainly, if we must...
- No, not you. Mary and I.

677
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,801
- You are not...
- What, invited?

678
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,595
Why would I not be invited
to my brother's country home?

679
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,305
Now you're not making any sense.

680
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:16,515
You're not human.

681
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,016
John Watson?

682
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:20,560
Yes.

683
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,521
Your bail's been posted.

684
00:57:28,444 --> 00:57:29,945
Mary.

685
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,284
Just Watson.

686
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,545
I hope you get bail by breakfast,
because the boys are getting hungry.

687
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,051
Step lively.

688
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,932
Back off. Back off.

689
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,560
To which the barman says,
"May I push in your stool?"

690
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,690
Right, you, you're out.

691
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,401
Until next time, Big Joe.

692
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,945
Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes.

693
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,657
Thank heaven you're here.
I'd almost run out of jokes.

694
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,951
In another life,
you'd have made an excellent criminal.

695
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:21,496
And you, sir, an excellent policeman.
Tomski, thank you.

696
00:58:22,623 --> 00:58:24,458
Now, please tell me you have answers.

697
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:26,918
All in good time, Lestrade.

698
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:30,589
"All in good time"? Is this some parlor game
where we guess what you're thinking?

699
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:33,967
I've got a public in frenzy out there.
If you don't fill me in...

700
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:37,971
...I'll have you in there playing Victoria
and Albert quicker than a bookie's runner.

701
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:41,266
Now, clean up
and make yourself presentable.

702
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,768
For whom?

703
00:58:42,935 --> 00:58:46,646
Friends in high places.
They're the ones who bailed you out.

704
00:58:57,408 --> 00:59:00,702
I'm terribly sorry
to inconvenience you, sir...

705
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,288
...but I'm gonna have to put this on you.

706
00:59:06,959 --> 00:59:11,463
Mr. Holmes,
apologies for summoning you like this.

707
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:15,425
I'm sure it's quite a mystery
as to where you are and who I am.

708
00:59:15,676 --> 00:59:16,968
As to where I am...

709
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:21,306
...I was, admittedly, lost for a moment
between Charing Cross and Holborn.

710
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:24,601
But I was saved by the bread shop
on Saffron Hill...

711
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:28,313
...the only baker to use a certain
French glaze on their loaves...

712
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:29,731
...a Brittany sage.

713
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:34,653
The carriage forked left, then right,
a telltale bump over the Fleet Conduit.

714
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:38,824
And as to who you are, that took every
ounce of my not inconsiderable experience.

715
00:59:38,991 --> 00:59:42,327
The letters on your desk are addressed
to Sir Thomas Rotheram.

716
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,913
Lord Chief Justice,
that'd be your official title.

717
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,667
Who you really are is, of course,
another matter entirely.

718
00:59:49,293 --> 00:59:51,169
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring...

719
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,880
...you're the head of
the Temple of the Four Orders...

720
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,841
...in whose headquarters we now sit...

721
00:59:56,008 --> 00:59:59,177
...on the northwest corner
of St. James's Square, I think.

722
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:03,765
As to the mystery, the only mystery is
why you bothered to blindfold me at all.

723
01:00:06,018 --> 01:00:10,188
Yes, well, standard procedure,
I suppose.

724
01:00:12,024 --> 01:00:14,359
I daresay we have the right man,
gentlemen.

725
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:17,279
Sherlock Holmes,
Ambassador Standish from America...

726
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,364
...and Lord Coward, the home secretary.

727
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:23,869
I suppose you already have some notion
as to the practices of our order.

728
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,538
Yes. Um...

729
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,374
They're practically interesting.

730
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,959
Be as skeptical as you like.

731
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:34,588
But our secret systems have steered
the world towards good for centuries.

732
01:00:34,755 --> 01:00:38,175
The danger is they can also be used
for more nefarious purposes.

733
01:00:38,342 --> 01:00:41,136
What some call the dark arts,
or practical magic.

734
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:44,890
We know you don't believe
in magic, Mr. Holmes.

735
01:00:45,057 --> 01:00:47,642
We don't expect you to share our faith...

736
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,227
...merely our fears.

737
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,980
Fear is the more infectious condition.

738
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,149
In this instance...

739
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:58,236
...fear of your own child.

740
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,200
Blackwood is your son.

741
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:06,828
You have the same irises,
a rare dark green...

742
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,914
...with diamond-shaped hazel flecks...

743
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:13,084
...together with identical outer ears, which
are only passed down through bloodline...

744
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:15,295
...which makes you either brothers...

745
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:18,215
...or, in this case, more likely,
father and son.

746
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,681
Very few people
are privy to that information...

747
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,683
...and we want to keep it that way.

748
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,607
He was conceived
during one of our rituals.

749
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,192
His mother wasn't my wife...

750
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,611
...but she shared our beliefs.

751
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,947
She was a powerful practitioner...

752
01:01:42,114 --> 01:01:44,783
...though not enough
to survive giving birth to him.

753
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,787
Death followed him wherever he went.

754
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,373
Those five girls were not the first
to be butchered.

755
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,709
He killed many more,
using them to enhance his powers.

756
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:58,463
No one could prove anything,
of course, but we all knew.

757
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,174
The boy was a curse.

758
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:04,302
We've done our best to stop him,
but it's not enough.

759
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,887
His power grows daily.

760
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,139
His resurrection is evidence of that.

761
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,809
But what he does next
will be more dangerous.

762
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:15,480
His secret lies in the book of spells.
This is the source of his power.

763
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:18,942
He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the course of the world.

764
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,903
We want you to find him
and stop him before he does.

765
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,699
We'll give you any assistance
that we can.

766
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:30,328
As home secretary, I have considerable
influence over the police.

767
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,038
Hm, yes.

768
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,125
So...

769
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:40,755
The benefit of being
a consulting detective...

770
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,008
...is that I can pick and choose
my clients.

771
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,677
So consider it done, I'll stop him.

772
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,139
But not for you.

773
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,266
And certainly not for a price.

774
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:58,106
- I do have a parting query, Sir Thomas.
- What is that?

775
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:02,110
If the rest of his family's dead,
how long do you expect to survive?

776
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:04,613
Food for thought.

777
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:33,058
Well, perhaps you'll have better luck
opening that.

778
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,895
Margaux '58. A comet vintage.

779
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,399
How fascinating that an astronomical event
can affect the quality...

780
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,069
How is it going with our case
you refuse to take?

781
01:03:44,236 --> 01:03:45,570
- Of the wine.

782
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:49,658
Oh, I've hit a dead end, literally.

783
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,744
I found your man.

784
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:55,246
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.

785
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:57,499
If you still need him.

786
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:01,252
Oh, dear.

787
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:06,424
Hope my client
doesn't come looking for a refund.

788
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:07,926
He's a professor, isn't he?

789
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,012
Couldn't see his face,
but I spotted chalk on his lapel.

790
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:15,433
I've never known a professor to carry a gun,
and on such a clever contraption.

791
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,940
Eye patch, nice touch.

792
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:24,943
So case closed...

793
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:28,113
...which makes this a social visit.

794
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,199
No, it's a "you're in over your head,
Irene" visit.

795
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:34,411
Whoever killed Reordan
was covering their tracks...

796
01:04:34,578 --> 01:04:36,788
...which makes you the next loose end
to be snipped.

797
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,500
Let it breathe.

798
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,586
I've never been in over my head.

799
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:47,298
Leave now. Disappear.
You're good at that.

800
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:51,553
Or stay and volunteer
for protective custody.

801
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,143
If I'm in danger, so are you.

802
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,481
Come with me.

803
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,819
What if we trusted each other?

804
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,529
Hm?

805
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:10,780
You're not listening.

806
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:15,535
I'm taking you to either the railway station
or the police station.

807
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:28,840
So...

808
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,012
- Which is it to be?
- Careful.

809
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,515
You decide.

810
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:40,101
- Which will it be?
- What...?

811
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:42,562
I told you to let it breathe.

812
01:05:43,355 --> 01:05:45,523
Can you taste the comet?

813
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:54,949
Why couldn't you just
come away with me?

814
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,036
Never.

815
01:07:44,768 --> 01:07:48,980
Madam, I need you to remain calm
and trust me, I'm a professional.

816
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:51,649
But beneath this pillow
lies the key to my release.

817
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:56,154
- She misinterpreted my intention entirely.
- Naturally, sir.

818
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:59,115
That's why I find this modern
religious fervor so troubling.

819
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:02,535
- No latitude for misunderstanding.
- Faith runs right over reason, sir.

820
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:05,705
Indeed. And chambermaids
were once such a liberal breed.

821
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:08,166
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.

822
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:14,213
Anyhow, a good thing she was offended,
or we may never have found you.

823
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:18,134
The inspector's been over to Baker Street
himself this morning, sir.

824
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,015
- Just joking about the wife, sir.
- Oh.

825
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:30,063
We've checked everything, sir.

826
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:33,066
No sign of a break-in
and the butler didn't hear a thing.

827
01:08:33,233 --> 01:08:35,401
So body in the bathtub...

828
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:39,822
...his eyes were wide open,
and the only thing missing was...

829
01:08:40,824 --> 01:08:42,867
...his ring, sir.

830
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:00,718
Why did you drain the water?

831
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:04,555
- Out of common decency.
- Crime is common, logic is rare.

832
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:08,726
The decent thing to do is to catch the killer,
not provide comfort for the corpse.

833
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,909
What is that?

834
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,415
- Jasmine bath salts, sir.
- Superb.

835
01:09:30,582 --> 01:09:34,210
Probably comes from a larger container.
It'll either be in the pantry...

836
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:38,089
...high up where it's warm and dry,
or in a linen cupboard with a vent.

837
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,591
Constable, you could do worse...

838
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:44,053
...than to check the ground under
the rear windows for any footprints.

839
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:46,931
Data, data, data.
I cannot make bricks without clay.

840
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:47,909
Mr. Holmes?

841
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,711
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?

842
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:00,671
It was in the pantry, sir.

843
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:02,924
I don't know what to make of this.

844
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,842
Excellent work.

845
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,761
Adieu.

846
01:11:44,716 --> 01:11:48,219
What's the meaning of this, Coward?
Why have you called this meeting?

847
01:11:49,429 --> 01:11:50,680
Sir Thomas is dead.

848
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:55,893
I nominate Lord Blackwood
as head of the order.

849
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:00,940
Have you lost your mind?

850
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:03,067
You know damn well
what he's capable of.

851
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:05,111
Of course he does.

852
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,865
That's why we're here.

853
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,076
That's why we're all here.

854
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:21,752
My powers and my assets
were given to me for one purpose.

855
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:26,299
A magnificent but simple purpose.

856
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:29,510
To create a new future.

857
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:33,598
A future ruled...

858
01:12:33,765 --> 01:12:35,516
...by us.

859
01:12:37,477 --> 01:12:42,607
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step
towards a new chapter in our history.

860
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:45,484
Magic will lead the way.

861
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:48,112
Once the people of England
see our newfound power...

862
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,198
...they'll bow down in fear.

863
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:58,956
Across the Atlantic
lies a colony that was once ours.

864
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:00,458
It will be again.

865
01:13:01,376 --> 01:13:03,628
The Civil War has made them weak.

866
01:13:03,795 --> 01:13:08,633
Their government is as corrupt
and as ineffective as ours...

867
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,010
...so we'll take it back.

868
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:15,014
We will remake the world...

869
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:18,434
...create the future.

870
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:23,481
These men are with me, Standish...

871
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,191
...but...

872
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:26,859
...are you?

873
01:13:27,527 --> 01:13:30,238
No, sir. I am not.

874
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,116
These powers that you're playing with...

875
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:36,327
...no man can control.

876
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:40,248
Well, gentlemen...

877
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:45,169
...someone has to stop him,
even if you won't.

878
01:13:47,422 --> 01:13:49,507
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

879
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:56,722
Save me!

880
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:14,490
Gentlemen...

881
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:16,534
...don't be afraid.

882
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:19,328
As you can see...

883
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,623
...we are protected.

884
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:26,377
Come, drink your allegiance here.

885
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:36,387
You control the police, now use them.

886
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,400
Didn't know you were here.

887
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:52,820
Since this room is no longer yours,
do you mind if I utilize it?

888
01:14:54,197 --> 01:14:55,698
Be my guest.

889
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,076
- In here, chaps.
- Where would you like me...

890
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:01,662
...to put him, sir?
- Anywhere is fine.

891
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:15,384
- Who is he?
- The man who tried to kill you at Reordan's.

892
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:18,429
His neck didn't survive the impact
of Dredger landing on him.

893
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:20,598
Yes.

894
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,142
Thanks for that, by the way.

895
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:29,648
There is consolation in the knowledge that
he could be of service to his fellow man.

896
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:38,282
Elbows and arms stained with blood,
but it's older than his own injuries.

897
01:15:44,247 --> 01:15:46,290
None of it human.

898
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:48,709
He's not a butcher, let me see.

899
01:15:58,845 --> 01:16:01,097
Yellow flame, green bursts.

900
01:16:01,681 --> 01:16:02,973
An industrial worker.

901
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,646
Pff. Coal.

902
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,439
River silt.

903
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:12,983
The slag on his trousers
should put him squarely in...

904
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:15,319
- Nine Elms.
- Sorry, what?

905
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:18,155
The area you're looking for is Nine Elms.

906
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,157
I wondered.

907
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:23,661
Do you remember where I put
the Lords Register of members' interests?

908
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,204
It's on the stepladder.

909
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:40,177
Well, Blackwood's had his hand in just about
everything that's corrosive to the spirit.

910
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:43,764
Woolwich Arsenal.
Limehouse Chemical Works.

911
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,933
It'll probably be a factory by the river.

912
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:47,852
What's that?

913
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,770
Never mind.

914
01:16:51,606 --> 01:16:53,858
You don't know where
my rugby ball went, do you?

915
01:16:54,025 --> 01:16:55,359
No, not a clue.

916
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:58,487
Queenshithe Slaughterhouse.

917
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:00,030
Nine Elms.

918
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:02,199
A factory by the river.

919
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:05,536
Well done. That should lead us
to Blackwood, dead or alive.

920
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:07,788
Not us.

921
01:17:09,624 --> 01:17:10,958
You.

922
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:12,877
Yes.

923
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:16,505
Just a figure of speech, old boy.

924
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:26,891
He's left it there on purpose.

925
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:49,872
More coal, doctor.

926
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,046
That's a good one. He's such a tit.

927
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:58,756
Oh, God. Yeah.

928
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:00,758
Glad to see you two
are working hard.

929
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:03,594
And I thought we were
trying to be discreet.

930
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:07,598
You would not last one day in the navy.

931
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:13,854
Are you sure there isn't an alternative
means of water transportation than that?

932
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:17,608
I guarantee you nobody knows
London's waterways better.

933
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:21,278
- Tanner's practically a fish himself.
- He certainly drinks like one.

934
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:23,614
Oh, you found a sense of humor, doctor.

935
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:26,033
If only just a sense.

936
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:30,371
I better take over, there.
Bit tricky down here.

937
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:53,435
Come on, come on.

938
01:19:08,743 --> 01:19:10,286
- Look familiar?
- Yep.

939
01:19:10,453 --> 01:19:13,122
All that's missing is a ginger midget.

940
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:28,053
They cleared something away from here
not minutes ago.

941
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:29,805
Like what?

942
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:33,183
Not sure. Something mechanical.

943
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:34,977
Holmes.

944
01:19:35,603 --> 01:19:37,354
Look at this.

945
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,130
- 1:18.
- Chapter and verse.

946
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:07,051
Revelations 1:18.
"I am he that liveth, and was dead."

947
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,471
"And behold, I'm alive for evermore."

948
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:15,476
I warned you, Holmes, to accept
that this was beyond your control...

949
01:20:15,643 --> 01:20:18,520
...beyond what your rational mind
could comprehend.

950
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:24,068
- What a busy afterlife you're having.
- I want you to bear witness.

951
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:29,156
Tomorrow, at midday,
the world as you know it will end.

952
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:31,742
Show me your face,
it'll be the end of your world.

953
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,869
Save your bullets, Watson.

954
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:35,537
A gift for you.

955
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:43,003
What was that about saving bullets?

956
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:51,720
She followed you here, Holmes.

957
01:20:53,723 --> 01:20:56,600
You led your lamb to slaughter.

958
01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:00,938
Holmes.

959
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,274
This game was designed to hurt.

960
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:17,371
Watson!

961
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:22,793
It's warm in here, Watson.

962
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,635
In over your head yet, darling?

963
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,270
- Hold on there.
- I can't.

964
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:43,105
Let me take your weight.

965
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:46,024
Give us a leg up, old boy.

966
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:50,320
These German locks
always give me trouble.

967
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:57,578
It's a band saw.

968
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,000
No matter, we have plenty of time.

969
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:06,044
Holmes.

970
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,180
- It's not working.
- Keep calm.

971
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:26,148
Holmes, hurry up.

972
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:36,533
Don't get excited. Turn off that valve.

973
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,644
And we'll bounce in three, two...

974
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:06,230
...one.

975
01:23:16,824 --> 01:23:18,909
Thank you.

976
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,577
I'm gonna get after Blackwood.

977
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:31,880
Thank you.

978
01:23:32,298 --> 01:23:34,925
We should help the doctor.

979
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:48,021
Holmes!

980
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:21,573
Mr. Holmes.

981
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,035
Sir.

982
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:30,499
Mr. Holmes.

983
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:43,053
Mr. Holmes, we have an order
for your arrest, sir.

984
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:48,141
Sir!

985
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:51,978
Lord Coward has issued a warrant
for your arrest, sir.

986
01:25:53,272 --> 01:25:54,773
Now, Watson's alive.

987
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:57,859
Just get out of here, sir. Go, sir, go.

988
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:16,002
Will the train be departing on time?

989
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:18,463
The train's been delayed, madam.

990
01:26:18,631 --> 01:26:20,674
Shouldn't be long now, though.

991
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:40,610
The train will depart when I tell it to.

992
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:45,532
And you will leave my employment
when I allow you to.

993
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:52,205
I fulfilled my contract.

994
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:53,623
I found Reordan.

995
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:55,959
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.

996
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:57,961
So that's me, finished.

997
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:02,007
Your job was to manipulate Holmes'
feelings for you...

998
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:03,759
...not succumb to them.

999
01:27:06,637 --> 01:27:08,472
You have fulfilled nothing.

1000
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:11,308
I want what Reordan was making
for Blackwood.

1001
01:27:11,934 --> 01:27:15,479
Finish the job or the next dead body...

1002
01:27:15,646 --> 01:27:18,273
...will be Sherlock Holmes.

1003
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:46,843
The surgeon should be along shortly.

1004
01:27:51,682 --> 01:27:54,017
He should be able to rest now.

1005
01:27:57,146 --> 01:27:58,647
Excuse me.

1006
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:04,361
Is that the best you can do?

1007
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,363
Yes, for now.

1008
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:08,657
I must attend to my other patients.

1009
01:28:10,701 --> 01:28:12,077
Doctor.

1010
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,204
Doctor.

1011
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,289
Please.

1012
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:23,213
I know that you care for him
as much as I do.

1013
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:26,800
This is not your responsibility,
it was his choice.

1014
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:30,720
He'd say that it was worth the wounds.

1015
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:39,229
Solve this.

1016
01:28:40,064 --> 01:28:42,065
Whatever it takes.

1017
01:28:52,368 --> 01:28:54,244
This is beyond your control.

1018
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,037
Sheer bloody panic, sir. Panic.

1019
01:28:56,205 --> 01:28:58,999
- It's Lord Blackwood, sir.
- I've never been in over my head.

1020
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:03,044
It's nothing to do with me,
but I advise you leave the case alone.

1021
01:29:03,212 --> 01:29:04,880
- Solve this.
- Are you, Holmes?

1022
01:29:05,047 --> 01:29:07,048
Accept that this was beyond your control.

1023
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:10,552
- Tomorrow, at midday, the world will end.
- I've got a public in frenzy.

1024
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,053
Holmes!

1025
01:29:33,117 --> 01:29:34,743
Widen your gaze.

1026
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:37,454
You must widen your gaze.
Widen your gaze.

1027
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:42,042
You and I are bound together on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature.

1028
01:29:42,209 --> 01:29:44,294
Steel your mind, Holmes.
Widen your gaze.

1029
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:46,880
He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the world.

1030
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:49,925
- His power grows daily.
- This is the source of his power.

1031
01:29:50,092 --> 01:29:51,092
I need you.

1032
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:53,803
His secret lies in the book of spells.

1033
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:23,875
Three more will die...

1034
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:27,295
...and there is nothing you can do
to save them.

1035
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:30,340
We know you don't believe in magic.

1036
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:33,218
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

1037
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:34,427
Is that better?

1038
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:37,055
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

1039
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:42,185
His eyes were wide open
and the only thing missing was his ring.

1040
01:30:49,276 --> 01:30:51,194
Give up, Holmes.

1041
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:55,865
This is a riddle you cannot solve.

1042
01:31:02,164 --> 01:31:03,373
Good morning.

1043
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:10,046
Now, you need to work.

1044
01:31:10,923 --> 01:31:12,173
Familiar artwork.

1045
01:31:15,302 --> 01:31:16,553
You look gorgeous.

1046
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,017
Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.

1047
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,401
You made the front page.

1048
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,528
Only a name and no picture.

1049
01:31:34,905 --> 01:31:38,867
So it looks like you'll be needing to
work outside the law now...

1050
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:41,077
...and that's my area of expertise.

1051
01:31:41,245 --> 01:31:43,204
I feel safer already.

1052
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:47,792
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.

1053
01:31:49,086 --> 01:31:50,712
Yes.

1054
01:31:50,921 --> 01:31:53,423
Took the shrapnel out myself.

1055
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:56,426
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.

1056
01:32:01,682 --> 01:32:03,183
Well, I'm...

1057
01:32:03,601 --> 01:32:05,143
I'm just so...

1058
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:06,895
...very glad that you're...

1059
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:08,438
...well...

1060
01:32:08,898 --> 01:32:10,356
...with us.

1061
01:32:14,528 --> 01:32:18,865
Now that you're sitting comfortably,
I shall begin.

1062
01:32:19,366 --> 01:32:22,410
My initial approach was far too narrow.

1063
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:25,038
When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville Prison...

1064
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:28,625
...he suggested I widen my gaze
and, at minimum, I have done just that.

1065
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:33,797
In fact, I may well have reconciled
thousands of years of theological disparity.

1066
01:32:35,132 --> 01:32:37,467
But that's for another time.

1067
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:40,804
Blackwood's method is based on
a ritualistic mystical system...

1068
01:32:40,971 --> 01:32:44,265
...that's been employed by the
Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.

1069
01:32:44,433 --> 01:32:47,519
To fully understand the system,
to get inside it...

1070
01:32:47,686 --> 01:32:51,231
...I reenacted the ceremony
we interrupted at the crypt...

1071
01:32:51,398 --> 01:32:53,316
...with a few enhancements of my own.

1072
01:32:54,276 --> 01:32:58,321
My journey took me somewhat further down
the rabbit hole than I had intended...

1073
01:32:58,489 --> 01:33:02,992
...and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail,
I have emerged enlightened.

1074
01:33:04,286 --> 01:33:06,830
The fraternity who silently control
the empire...

1075
01:33:06,997 --> 01:33:10,166
...share the belief with the kings,
pharaohs and emperors of old...

1076
01:33:10,334 --> 01:33:13,128
...that the sphinx was a door
to another dimension...

1077
01:33:13,295 --> 01:33:15,380
...a gateway to immeasurable power.

1078
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:19,300
It's made up of four parts:
The foot of a lion, the tail of an ox...

1079
01:33:19,468 --> 01:33:21,845
...the wings of an eagle,
and the head of a man.

1080
01:33:22,638 --> 01:33:25,557
In Sir Thomas's secret chamber,
I found the bone of an ox...

1081
01:33:25,724 --> 01:33:28,810
...the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle
and hair of a man.

1082
01:33:28,978 --> 01:33:30,353
Map.

1083
01:33:34,191 --> 01:33:37,026
The points of the star
represent the five murdered girls...

1084
01:33:37,194 --> 01:33:40,155
...but the cross
is what we're now interested in.

1085
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:41,698
It's a widely held belief...

1086
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:45,243
...that within the architecture
of the great cities...

1087
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:48,163
...are coded references to this system.

1088
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:51,332
Since he rose from the grave,
Blackwood has killed three men...

1089
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:55,003
...each committed at a location
that has a connection with the temple...

1090
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:56,546
...therefore the system.

1091
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:00,550
Reordan, the ginger midget,
represents man.

1092
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:02,719
We found his body here.

1093
01:34:03,345 --> 01:34:06,556
Sir Thomas, master of the temple,
wore the ox ring.

1094
01:34:07,516 --> 01:34:09,058
He died here.

1095
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,519
Standish, ambassador to America...

1096
01:34:11,687 --> 01:34:14,814
...where the eagle has been
the national emblem for over 100 years.

1097
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:19,068
The headquarters of the Temple
of the Four Orders where he died...

1098
01:34:19,236 --> 01:34:21,487
...is here.

1099
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:25,491
Correspondingly, the map will tell us
the location of Blackwood's final act.

1100
01:34:25,659 --> 01:34:28,494
So we have man, the ox, eagle.

1101
01:34:29,413 --> 01:34:30,580
Only the lion remaining.

1102
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:31,915
Right here.

1103
01:34:34,585 --> 01:34:35,752
Parliament.

1104
01:34:40,591 --> 01:34:42,050
Right.

1105
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:45,762
You four stay here
and the rest of you come with me.

1106
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,806
- Get out of the way, you lowlifes!
- Right this way.

1107
01:34:52,269 --> 01:34:54,103
Ladies first.

1108
01:34:54,271 --> 01:34:55,772
Now.

1109
01:34:56,732 --> 01:34:58,024
Follow these instructions.

1110
01:34:58,192 --> 01:34:59,734
- Aren't you...?
- Go.

1111
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:05,531
Hello, hello, hello.

1112
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:08,284
Did the devil turn up?

1113
01:35:09,536 --> 01:35:10,912
Well...

1114
01:35:11,288 --> 01:35:12,956
...never mind.

1115
01:35:13,457 --> 01:35:15,124
You got the next best thing.

1116
01:35:38,482 --> 01:35:42,819
Beg your pardon, my Lord.
I know that it's unorthodox...

1117
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:45,488
...but Mr. Holmes here...

1118
01:35:45,656 --> 01:35:49,325
...he's been making some
serious accusations about you...

1119
01:35:50,536 --> 01:35:52,078
...and the order.

1120
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:55,164
I see.

1121
01:35:55,332 --> 01:35:59,502
Well, at least that solves the great mystery
as to how you became inspector.

1122
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:06,801
Excuse me, my Lord...

1123
01:36:07,344 --> 01:36:09,846
...but I've been wanting to do that
for a long time.

1124
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:13,683
Well, inspector, I have five minutes
before my next engagement...

1125
01:36:14,309 --> 01:36:17,687
...so why don't you regale me
with your stories of conspiracy?

1126
01:36:20,774 --> 01:36:22,275
Thank you, Lestrade.

1127
01:36:22,776 --> 01:36:24,360
My Lord.

1128
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:33,327
I'm curious, Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders...

1129
01:36:33,537 --> 01:36:35,496
...or just the one I prevented?

1130
01:36:36,665 --> 01:36:39,125
Very distinctive,
those handmade shoes of yours.

1131
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:46,424
But the price of quality
is often the unique imprint they leave.

1132
01:36:47,384 --> 01:36:50,553
Nonetheless, I confess to being
completely outmatched.

1133
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:54,015
I could deduce very little
from my investigation.

1134
01:36:55,392 --> 01:36:57,560
Fortunately,
there's nothing more stimulating...

1135
01:36:57,728 --> 01:37:00,063
...than a case where everything
goes against you.

1136
01:37:00,731 --> 01:37:04,233
How many members of Parliament
do you intend to murder at noon today?

1137
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:06,027
Man, ox, eagle, lion.

1138
01:37:06,904 --> 01:37:08,488
The lion is Parliament, isn't it?

1139
01:37:11,575 --> 01:37:13,284
Very clever.

1140
01:37:13,702 --> 01:37:16,245
But it's not murder, Mr. Holmes.

1141
01:37:16,413 --> 01:37:18,081
It's mercy.

1142
01:37:18,248 --> 01:37:20,750
We are giving the weak masses
a strong shepherd.

1143
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:23,377
Don't you see that it's for their own?

1144
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:28,883
No, but I don't care much what you think.

1145
01:37:29,051 --> 01:37:31,928
I simply wanted to know the location
of Blackwood's ceremony...

1146
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:33,513
...and you've given it to me.

1147
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:34,889
I've told you nothing.

1148
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:38,768
But your clothes say
infinitely more than you could ever hope.

1149
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:42,271
The mud on your boots
from where you've been walking.

1150
01:37:42,272 --> 01:37:45,608
A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you've been kneeling.

1151
01:37:46,902 --> 01:37:50,113
A small bandage on your thumb
from where you've been vowing.

1152
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:54,283
A faint aroma of excrement
from where you've been standing.

1153
01:37:56,537 --> 01:37:59,288
You and Blackwood laid the final touches
to your ceremony...

1154
01:37:59,456 --> 01:38:02,542
...in the sewers beneath Parliament
less than an hour ago.

1155
01:38:03,627 --> 01:38:05,628
Both houses meet today.

1156
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:08,214
The whole government will be present.

1157
01:38:17,599 --> 01:38:20,893
It's a shame you made an enemy
out of Blackwood, Holmes.

1158
01:38:21,603 --> 01:38:23,396
You would have made a valuable ally.

1159
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:32,738
How terrible is wisdom...

1160
01:38:32,906 --> 01:38:35,783
...when it brings no profit to the wise.

1161
01:38:36,493 --> 01:38:37,994
We take power at noon.

1162
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:41,330
There isn't any time to waste then,
is there?

1163
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:10,443
I told you he'd be coming
out the top window.

1164
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:13,112
There isn't any way
he'd be coming over that terrace.

1165
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:16,115
Technically, that isn't the top window,
is it, sailor boy?

1166
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:18,784
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.

1167
01:39:18,952 --> 01:39:20,119
Anyway.

1168
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:23,789
You'll be pleased to know
Lestrade performed perfectly.

1169
01:39:23,957 --> 01:39:25,625
In fact, I think he enjoyed it.

1170
01:39:25,792 --> 01:39:27,501
I hope you know what you're doing.

1171
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:29,879
Here's the key.

1172
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:33,883
- You got all you needed from Coward?
- Yes, I smoked him out with relative ease.

1173
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:36,302
- Tanner?
- Sir?

1174
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:37,720
If you would, captain...

1175
01:39:37,888 --> 01:39:40,723
...take us under the bridge,
port side, 100 yards.

1176
01:39:40,891 --> 01:39:44,227
Beyond that you'll find the tunnel
that leads us to the sewers.

1177
01:39:44,394 --> 01:39:45,811
Right away, sir.

1178
01:39:52,569 --> 01:39:54,445
The end is nigh.

1179
01:39:54,613 --> 01:39:58,908
Blackwood's come back from hell
and laid a curse upon this land.

1180
01:39:59,076 --> 01:40:02,703
He walks in every shadow
and every puff of smoke.

1181
01:40:02,871 --> 01:40:05,539
Behold, he cometh with clouds...

1182
01:40:05,707 --> 01:40:08,542
...and every eye shall see him...

1183
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:12,296
...and every soul shall wail
because of him.

1184
01:40:12,464 --> 01:40:15,466
You cannot stop him!
No one can!

1185
01:40:45,497 --> 01:40:47,957
Behold, Blackwood's magic revealed.

1186
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:50,459
- What does it do?
- It's a chemical weapon.

1187
01:40:51,253 --> 01:40:52,378
The first of its kind.

1188
01:40:52,546 --> 01:40:54,505
You deduced that how?

1189
01:40:54,673 --> 01:40:56,424
From my pocket.

1190
01:40:56,591 --> 01:40:59,593
I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat
at the slaughterhouse.

1191
01:40:59,761 --> 01:41:02,888
Note the blue discoloration,
the faint smell of bitter almonds.

1192
01:41:03,056 --> 01:41:05,141
- Telltale traces of cyanide.
- Cyanide.

1193
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:06,892
Shh.

1194
01:41:09,938 --> 01:41:12,273
Now we know what the ginger
midget was working on.

1195
01:41:12,441 --> 01:41:14,317
It'll revolutionize warfare.

1196
01:41:14,484 --> 01:41:16,027
Yes, killing a lot of people.

1197
01:41:16,194 --> 01:41:18,821
Now, it's seven minutes to noon.
What are we gonna do?

1198
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:21,991
Right. How many men
did you count on the...?

1199
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:27,621
She loves an entrance, your muse.

1200
01:41:58,403 --> 01:41:59,695
Woman!

1201
01:42:00,822 --> 01:42:02,698
Shoot him. Now, please.

1202
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:19,840
My lords.

1203
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:22,051
The time has come...

1204
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:24,553
...for only those who believe to remain.

1205
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:27,681
Behold...

1206
01:42:27,849 --> 01:42:29,725
...Lord Blackwood.

1207
01:42:42,697 --> 01:42:44,365
You seem surprised.

1208
01:42:47,077 --> 01:42:50,496
I have returned from beyond the grave
to fulfill England's destiny...

1209
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:55,418
...and extend the boundaries
of this great empire.

1210
01:42:58,088 --> 01:43:00,047
Listen to the rabble outside.

1211
01:43:00,715 --> 01:43:02,216
Listen...

1212
01:43:02,384 --> 01:43:03,759
...to the fear.

1213
01:43:04,386 --> 01:43:06,053
I will use that as a weapon...

1214
01:43:06,221 --> 01:43:08,139
...to control them...

1215
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:09,890
...and then the world.

1216
01:43:14,271 --> 01:43:16,564
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.

1217
01:43:20,193 --> 01:43:23,195
Specifically designed
to prevent us from disarming it.

1218
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:28,742
These appear to be designed
to receive a signal of some sort.

1219
01:43:28,910 --> 01:43:30,119
Electromagnetic waves?

1220
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:31,954
When triggered, the electrodes...

1221
01:43:32,122 --> 01:43:34,707
...will send a charge
converting the chemical into gas.

1222
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:38,752
The gas will travel up that shaft
and filter through the ventilation system...

1223
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:41,547
...that leads directly to Parliament.
Within seconds...

1224
01:43:41,715 --> 01:43:44,800
...the most powerful men in the
world will be choking on death.

1225
01:43:44,968 --> 01:43:48,304
Blackwood must have some transmitter
that he can activate remotely.

1226
01:43:48,472 --> 01:43:50,306
Three minutes, 10 seconds.

1227
01:43:50,724 --> 01:43:54,810
I will create an empire
that will endure for millennia...

1228
01:43:55,437 --> 01:43:57,062
...indestructible...

1229
01:43:57,230 --> 01:43:58,481
...and eternal.

1230
01:43:59,065 --> 01:44:00,900
Move it. Move it.

1231
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:03,819
We don't actually have to
disarm the device...

1232
01:44:03,987 --> 01:44:07,531
...we just have to remove the cylinders.

1233
01:44:07,699 --> 01:44:10,659
Yes, except that they're welded in.

1234
01:44:10,827 --> 01:44:13,954
What we need is a controlled explosion.

1235
01:44:14,122 --> 01:44:17,708
We'll need a container to direct the blast.
My clay pipe should service that ambition.

1236
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:41,106
I rather wish you hadn't done that,
Irene.

1237
01:44:47,405 --> 01:44:52,409
On the 12th chime,
I will summon the dark powers.

1238
01:44:52,994 --> 01:44:57,331
All those of you who are with me
shall be protected.

1239
01:44:57,499 --> 01:44:58,541
All others...

1240
01:44:58,708 --> 01:45:00,042
...will perish.

1241
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:08,968
I need your pipe.

1242
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,056
Nut him!

1243
01:45:39,332 --> 01:45:40,749
- Right.
- What?

1244
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:42,585
- Coat.
- Got it.

1245
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:22,082
The new order...

1246
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:24,627
...begins now.

1247
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:31,800
Woman.

1248
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:34,261
What are you waiting for?

1249
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:38,349
That.

1250
01:46:49,653 --> 01:46:51,320
Apprehend Lord Coward.

1251
01:46:53,907 --> 01:46:55,783
- Can you manage?
- Course I can.

1252
01:47:22,811 --> 01:47:24,228
Relax...

1253
01:47:24,396 --> 01:47:25,437
...I'm a doctor.

1254
01:48:37,594 --> 01:48:40,012
Did you take a wrong turning
somewhere?

1255
01:48:42,056 --> 01:48:43,265
We're safe now.

1256
01:48:44,309 --> 01:48:45,601
Interesting assessment.

1257
01:48:48,146 --> 01:48:49,813
Run off.

1258
01:48:52,066 --> 01:48:53,859
I won't be chasing you anymore.

1259
01:48:55,445 --> 01:48:57,279
Fare thee well.

1260
01:49:02,452 --> 01:49:04,453
I don't want to run anymore.

1261
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:09,792
- I'll tell you everything.
- I wish you would.

1262
01:49:33,983 --> 01:49:35,150
No!

1263
01:50:41,009 --> 01:50:42,467
There was never any magic.

1264
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:46,221
Only conjuring tricks.

1265
01:50:50,852 --> 01:50:52,853
The simplest involved
paying people off...

1266
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:56,273
...like the guard who pretended
to be possessed outside your cell.

1267
01:50:56,441 --> 01:50:58,984
Your reputation
and the inmates' fear did the rest.

1268
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:03,071
Others required
more elaborate preparations...

1269
01:51:03,239 --> 01:51:06,533
...like the sandstone slab
that covered your tomb.

1270
01:51:07,493 --> 01:51:11,455
You had it broken before your burial,
then put back together using an adhesive.

1271
01:51:12,790 --> 01:51:15,250
An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe...

1272
01:51:15,418 --> 01:51:17,502
...a mixture of egg and honey...

1273
01:51:18,171 --> 01:51:20,422
...designed to be washed away
by the rain.

1274
01:51:25,428 --> 01:51:26,762
Holmes!

1275
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:29,681
Arranging for your father
to drown in his own bathtub...

1276
01:51:29,849 --> 01:51:31,683
...required more modern science.

1277
01:51:31,851 --> 01:51:34,770
Very clever of Reordan
to find a paralytic...

1278
01:51:34,938 --> 01:51:37,940
...that was activated by the combination
of copper and water...

1279
01:51:38,107 --> 01:51:41,443
...and was therefore undetectable
once the bath water was drained.

1280
01:51:42,278 --> 01:51:44,279
That might've been a challenge for me...

1281
01:51:44,447 --> 01:51:48,033
...had he not also tested it
on some unfortunate amphibians.

1282
01:51:52,705 --> 01:51:55,791
The death of Standish
was a real mystery...

1283
01:51:55,959 --> 01:51:59,044
...until you used the same compound
to blow up the wharf.

1284
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:02,798
An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid...

1285
01:52:03,424 --> 01:52:05,550
...yet it burned
with an unusual pinkish hue.

1286
01:52:07,637 --> 01:52:10,973
Did Standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple?

1287
01:52:12,141 --> 01:52:13,600
All it took was a spark.

1288
01:52:18,064 --> 01:52:20,273
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.

1289
01:52:21,734 --> 01:52:23,151
Ingenious.

1290
01:52:23,319 --> 01:52:26,780
Like all great performers, you saved
your pièce de résistance for the end:

1291
01:52:26,948 --> 01:52:31,743
A chemical weapon distilled from cyanide
and refined in the bellies of swine.

1292
01:52:31,911 --> 01:52:33,453
Had it worked...

1293
01:52:33,621 --> 01:52:36,498
...your followers in Parliament
would have watched unharmed...

1294
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:39,167
...as their colleagues
were dying around them.

1295
01:52:39,335 --> 01:52:41,336
They didn't know
you'd given them the antidote.

1296
01:52:41,504 --> 01:52:43,922
Instead,
they would've believed it was magic...

1297
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:46,800
...and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.

1298
01:52:47,135 --> 01:52:50,846
And the world would've followed,
fear being the most powerful weapon of all.

1299
01:52:52,807 --> 01:52:55,684
You'd better hope
that it's nothing more than superstition...

1300
01:52:55,852 --> 01:52:58,020
...as you performed
all the rituals perfectly.

1301
01:52:58,855 --> 01:53:00,814
The devil is due a soul, I'd say.

1302
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:05,193
For God's sake, Holmes, cut me loose.

1303
01:53:15,997 --> 01:53:19,624
First, the world will see you
for what you are. A fraud.

1304
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:22,544
Then you'll be hanged.

1305
01:53:22,712 --> 01:53:24,546
Properly, this time.

1306
01:53:24,714 --> 01:53:26,840
It's a long journey from here to the rope.

1307
01:54:18,184 --> 01:54:21,103
I've never woken up in handcuffs before.

1308
01:54:22,105 --> 01:54:23,647
I have.

1309
01:54:24,941 --> 01:54:26,525
Naked.

1310
01:54:30,488 --> 01:54:32,614
Storm's coming.

1311
01:54:32,907 --> 01:54:36,451
Well, we've still got a moment.

1312
01:54:40,456 --> 01:54:41,706
Moriarty.

1313
01:54:41,874 --> 01:54:43,291
What?

1314
01:54:43,459 --> 01:54:45,460
That's his name.

1315
01:54:46,045 --> 01:54:48,213
And he is a professor.

1316
01:54:50,341 --> 01:54:52,425
Everyone has a weak spot...

1317
01:54:52,844 --> 01:54:55,095
...and he found mine.

1318
01:54:56,514 --> 01:54:58,473
Where was it, precisely?

1319
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:12,487
- Please don't underestimate him.
- Mm.

1320
01:55:12,655 --> 01:55:15,031
He's just as brilliant as you are...

1321
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:17,450
...and infinitely more devious.

1322
01:55:17,618 --> 01:55:19,828
We'll see about that.

1323
01:55:36,304 --> 01:55:38,680
You'll miss me, Sherlock.

1324
01:55:40,683 --> 01:55:42,350
Sadly...

1325
01:55:42,977 --> 01:55:44,644
...yes.

1326
01:56:10,004 --> 01:56:11,838
Just keep it under your hat.

1327
01:56:12,006 --> 01:56:14,925
Afternoon, sir.
I put the notebooks in this one, sir.

1328
01:56:15,092 --> 01:56:17,052
- Thank you.
- What's in these, John?

1329
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:18,220
Scribbles.

1330
01:56:18,387 --> 01:56:19,888
- Scribbles?
- Notes.

1331
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:22,724
They're your adventures.
I'd like to read them.

1332
01:56:29,565 --> 01:56:30,899
Come on, what's wrong?

1333
01:56:31,067 --> 01:56:33,610
Do you think he's come to terms
with you leaving?

1334
01:56:33,778 --> 01:56:37,155
Mary, look at the ring he's given us.

1335
01:56:37,782 --> 01:56:40,075
Now, five minutes here
and we'll go home.

1336
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:41,618
Our home.

1337
01:56:41,786 --> 01:56:43,453
Get up those stairs.

1338
01:56:51,379 --> 01:56:52,921
Don't worry, dear.

1339
01:56:53,089 --> 01:56:55,173
Suicide is not in his repertoire.

1340
01:56:55,341 --> 01:56:57,634
He's far too fond of himself for that.

1341
01:56:58,261 --> 01:56:59,928
Holmes.

1342
01:57:01,555 --> 01:57:03,682
Oh. Good afternoon.

1343
01:57:03,849 --> 01:57:07,936
I was trying to deduce the manner
in which Blackwood survived his execution.

1344
01:57:08,104 --> 01:57:10,188
Clearing your good name, as it were.

1345
01:57:10,523 --> 01:57:13,066
But it had a surprisingly
soporific effect...

1346
01:57:13,234 --> 01:57:16,945
...and I was carried off in the arms
of Morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon.

1347
01:57:17,113 --> 01:57:18,446
Good afternoon, dear.

1348
01:57:18,614 --> 01:57:20,282
Get on with it, Holmes.

1349
01:57:20,449 --> 01:57:24,119
Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot
was a hook.

1350
01:57:24,287 --> 01:57:27,289
Oh, dear, my legs have fallen asleep.
I should come down.

1351
01:57:27,456 --> 01:57:29,040
John, shouldn't we help him down?

1352
01:57:29,208 --> 01:57:31,626
No, no, no,
I hate to cut him off midstream.

1353
01:57:31,794 --> 01:57:32,961
Carry on.

1354
01:57:34,005 --> 01:57:36,673
Well, the executioner
attached it to a harness...

1355
01:57:36,841 --> 01:57:39,634
...allowing the weight to be
distributed around the waist...

1356
01:57:39,802 --> 01:57:41,845
...and the neck to remain intact.

1357
01:57:42,013 --> 01:57:45,473
My Lord, I can't feel my cheeks.
Might we continue this at ground level?

1358
01:57:45,641 --> 01:57:47,267
How did you manage it, Holmes?

1359
01:57:47,893 --> 01:57:51,104
I managed it with braces,
belts and a coat hook.

1360
01:57:52,064 --> 01:57:54,941
Please, my tongue is going,
I'll be of no use to you at all.

1361
01:57:55,109 --> 01:57:56,818
- Worse things could happen.
- John.

1362
01:57:59,655 --> 01:58:02,782
Yet none of this explains
Blackwood's lack of pulse.

1363
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:04,326
Right.

1364
01:58:04,493 --> 01:58:09,789
Now, the medical mystery.
We must restore your reputation, Watson.

1365
01:58:09,957 --> 01:58:13,585
There is a toxin refined from the nectar
of the rhododendron ponticum.

1366
01:58:13,753 --> 01:58:16,838
It's infamous in the region of Turkey
bordering the Black Sea...

1367
01:58:17,006 --> 01:58:20,508
...for its ability to induce
an apparently mortal paralysis.

1368
01:58:20,676 --> 01:58:24,095
Enough to mislead a medical mind
even as well-trained as your own.

1369
01:58:24,263 --> 01:58:26,598
- It's known as...
- What's wrong with Gladstone?

1370
01:58:26,766 --> 01:58:28,641
Mad honey disease.

1371
01:58:28,809 --> 01:58:32,604
Oh, he's demonstrating
the very effect I've just described.

1372
01:58:32,980 --> 01:58:34,314
He doesn't mind.

1373
01:58:36,859 --> 01:58:39,277
Mary, don't worry, he's seen far worse.

1374
01:58:39,904 --> 01:58:41,279
Mr. Holmes?

1375
01:58:43,574 --> 01:58:44,824
Doctor. Miss Mary.

1376
01:58:45,534 --> 01:58:48,661
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks that
you come with me right away.

1377
01:58:49,205 --> 01:58:52,540
- What is it is this time, Clarkie?
- It's one of our sergeants, sir.

1378
01:58:52,708 --> 01:58:55,293
He went missing
the day you stopped Lord Blackwood.

1379
01:58:55,461 --> 01:58:59,047
I'm afraid sewage workers
found his body just this morning, sir.

1380
01:58:59,507 --> 01:59:02,550
We believe the sergeant
was our first man on the scene.

1381
01:59:02,718 --> 01:59:04,511
Can I help you, officer?

1382
01:59:05,262 --> 01:59:06,304
Shot in the head.

1383
01:59:07,973 --> 01:59:09,724
Was it a small caliber bullet?

1384
01:59:10,851 --> 01:59:12,185
Yes.

1385
01:59:13,687 --> 01:59:15,939
Were there powder burns
on his eyebrows?

1386
01:59:16,107 --> 01:59:17,774
Indeed, sir.

1387
01:59:19,902 --> 01:59:21,236
Point blank range?

1388
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:22,654
Moriarty.

1389
01:59:24,073 --> 01:59:26,241
Professor Moriarty.

1390
01:59:28,786 --> 01:59:30,745
Oh, there's a good boy.

1391
01:59:30,913 --> 01:59:32,497
Everything's gonna be fine.

1392
01:59:33,707 --> 01:59:35,375
Where is Blackwood's device now?

1393
01:59:35,543 --> 01:59:38,586
Secret Service have it, sir.
They've taken over the case.

1394
01:59:39,088 --> 01:59:41,297
I'd wager there's a piece missing.

1395
01:59:43,259 --> 01:59:46,302
So Moriarty was after
a piece of the machine...

1396
01:59:46,929 --> 01:59:48,179
...not the poison.

1397
01:59:48,347 --> 01:59:50,765
There's nothing more elusive
than an obvious fact.

1398
01:59:50,933 --> 01:59:53,393
The wire-free invention
was the game all along.

1399
01:59:53,561 --> 01:59:56,020
And Adler was just the diversion.

1400
01:59:56,188 --> 01:59:58,815
He knew I'd chase her,
heaving the machine accessible.

1401
01:59:58,983 --> 02:00:02,861
A technology of that kind
would be worth an untold fortune.

1402
02:00:03,028 --> 02:00:05,321
Imagine being able
to control any device...

1403
02:00:05,489 --> 02:00:09,159
...simply by sending a command
via radio waves.

1404
02:00:09,952 --> 02:00:11,953
It's the future, Watson.

1405
02:00:14,248 --> 02:00:16,708
I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.

1406
02:00:20,045 --> 02:00:21,629
- Well...
- Well...

1407
02:00:22,965 --> 02:00:25,842
- Gladstone.
- Stop him before he gets to the front door.

1408
02:00:26,427 --> 02:00:27,844
Clarkie.

1409
02:00:30,097 --> 02:00:31,931
Case reopened.
