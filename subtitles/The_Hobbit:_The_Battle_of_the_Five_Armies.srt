00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:12,053
Thorin,

3
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,917
you gave a promise.

4
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:21,271
You brought upon them
only ruin and death.

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,653
You've won the mountain.
Is that not enough?

6
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,077
Now

7
00:00:36,877 --> 00:00:38,455
we defend it.

8
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:44,502
I came to reclaim something of mine.

9
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:51,301
This is the last move
in a master plan.

10
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,762
A plan

11
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,462
long in the making.

12
00:00:59,424 --> 00:01:01,770
These bats
are bred for one purpose.

13
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,814
For war.

14
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,529
Leave Sauron to me.

15
00:01:15,483 --> 00:01:16,660
Bilbo was right.

16
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:20,038
You cannot see what you have become.

17
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:23,041
Everything I did,

18
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,710
I did for them.

19
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,380
You started this.

20
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:31,800
You will forgive me if I finish it.

21
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:35,887
When faced

22
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,013
with death,

23
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,556
what can anyone do?

24
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:45,438
I will not hide

25
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,607
while others fight our battles

26
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:48,817
for us!

27
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,673
You have but one question to answer.

28
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:14,926
How shall this day end?
