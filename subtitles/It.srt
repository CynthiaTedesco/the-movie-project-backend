2
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:21,002
Sure I will not
get into trouble, Bill?

3
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:24,445
Don't be a wu-wu-wuss.

4
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:28,550
I'd come with you
if I weren't... dying.

5
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:30,966
You're not dying!

6
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:35,040
You didn't see the v-v-vomit
coming out of my nose this morning?

7
00:01:35,104 --> 00:01:37,322
That's disgusting.

8
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:40,632
Ok, go get the wax.

9
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,943
In the cellar?

10
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:46,889
You want to fl-fl-float, dont' you?

11
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:48,842
Fine.

12
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:51,573
Hurry up.

13
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:01,636
Ok, don't worry.

14
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:23,849
Where is the wax?

15
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,299
There it is.

16
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:28,391
Yes.

17
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:50,961
What was that?
What is that?

18
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:12,942
Alright.

19
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:17,061
There you go.
Sh-sh-she's all ready, captain.

20
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:18,444
She?

21
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:21,284
You always call a b-boat, she.

22
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:23,608
She?

23
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:25,157
Thanks, Billy.

24
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:35,916
See you later.
Bye.

25
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,889
Be careful.

26
00:05:52,882 --> 00:05:53,942
No!

27
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,133
No!

28
00:05:58,113 --> 00:05:59,503
Bill's gonna kill me.

29
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,685
Hiya Georgie.

30
00:06:14,102 --> 00:06:15,492
What a nice boat...

31
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:17,611
Do you want it back?

32
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:20,027
Yes please.

33
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:23,536
You look like a nice boy.
I bet you have a lot of friends.

34
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:27,844
Three,
but my brother is the bestest.

35
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:29,131
Where's he?

36
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:31,448
In bed... sick.

37
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:35,156
I bet I could cheer him up.
I'll give him a balloon.

38
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,593
Do you want a
balloon too Georgie?

39
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:43,796
I'm not supposed to take
stuff from strangers.

40
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,530
Oh well, I'm Pennywised,
dancing clown.

41
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:53,926
Pennywise yes meet Georgie.

42
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:56,309
Georgie meet Pennywise.

43
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:01,076
Now we are not strangers,
are we?

44
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,090
What are you doing in the sewer?

45
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:25,639
A storm blew me away.

46
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:29,248
Blew the whole circus away.

47
00:07:31,863 --> 00:07:34,478
Can you smell the circus,
Georgie?

48
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:39,708
There are peanuts,
cotton candy...

49
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:41,794
Hot dogs...

50
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:43,681
annnnnnd...

51
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:45,973
Popcorn?

52
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,117
Popcorn!
Is that your favorite?

53
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:51,030
- Uh huh.
- Mine too!

54
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:55,002
Because they pop.
Pop, pop, pop.

55
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:57,518
Pop, pop, pop.

56
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,776
Pop!

57
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,058
I should get going now.

58
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:14,467
Without your boat?

59
00:08:14,964 --> 00:08:17,447
You don't want to lose it Georgie.

60
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:19,764
Bill's gonna kill you.

61
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:24,796
Here.

62
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:27,146
Take it.

63
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:32,906
Take it, Georgie.

64
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:55,457
Help!

65
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,712
Billy!

66
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:10,572
Pull it, Mike.

67
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,696
Go on now, pull it.

68
00:10:26,753 --> 00:10:27,845
Here, reload it.

69
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,891
You need to start takin' more
responsibility around here, Mike.

70
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,812
Your dad was younger
than you when...

71
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:35,029
I'm not my dad, okay?

72
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:36,757
Yeah.

73
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:40,292
Look at me, son.

74
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:42,312
Look at me!

75
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:47,443
There are two places you
can be in this world.

76
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:50,855
You can be here like us
or you can be in there...

77
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:52,441
Like them.

78
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:54,461
If you waste your time
hemming and hawing,

79
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:57,970
then someone else is gonna
make that choice for you.

80
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:02,803
Except you wont know it until
you feel that bolt between your eyes.

81
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:14,191
There is a church full of Jews, right?

82
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:16,475
And Stan has to take
the super Jew-y test.

83
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:18,130
But how does it work?

84
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,017
They slice the tip of his dick off.

85
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:21,639
But then Stan'll have nothing left!

86
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:23,460
- It is true.
- Wait, you guys!

87
00:11:23,658 --> 00:11:26,141
Hey, Stan, what happens at
the bar mitzvah anyways?

88
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,716
Ed says they slice your d-d-d-dick off.

89
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:32,100
Yes, I think the Rabbi's gonna
pull down your pants..

90
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:34,417
And he will tell the crowd:
"Where's the beef?".

91
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,595
At the bar mitzvah,
I read from the Torah...

92
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,078
and then I make a speech,
and suddenly I become a man.

93
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:41,916
There's more funner
ways to become a man.

94
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,355
"More fun ways", you mean.

95
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:44,414
Shit.

96
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:52,624
Think they'll sign my yearbook?

97
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:53,823
"Dear Richie...

98
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:56,630
sorry for taking a hot, steaming
dump in your backpack last month.

99
00:11:57,226 --> 00:11:58,550
"Have a good summer".

100
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:10,677
Are you in there by
yourself, Beaver-ly.

101
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,614
Or you have half the guys in
the school with you, huh slut?

102
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:16,922
I know you're in there,
you little shit, I can smell you.

103
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,875
No wonder you don't
have any friends.

104
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:22,980
Which is it, Greta?
Am I a slut or a little shit.

105
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:24,669
Make up your mind.

106
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:25,867
You're trash.

107
00:12:28,608 --> 00:12:29,768
We just wanted to remind you.

108
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:30,932
Such a loser.

109
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,586
At least now you'll smell better.

110
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:37,851
Oh Gross.

111
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:39,963
Let's go girls.

112
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,916
Have a nice summer,
Beaver-ly.

113
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:43,114
Pathetic.

114
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:53,502
The best feeling ever.

115
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:54,462
Yeah?

116
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:56,281
Try tickling your pickle
for the first time.

117
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:57,904
What do you guys
wanna do tomorrow?

118
00:12:57,905 --> 00:12:59,130
I start my training.

119
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:00,917
- What training?
- Street Fighter.

120
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:03,665
Is that how you want to spend
your summer? cyber in arcade.

121
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:05,452
It's better than inside your mother.

122
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:07,539
What if we go the the quarry?

123
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,113
Guys, we can g-go to the barrens.

124
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:13,464
Right.

125
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:15,715
Betty Ripsom's mom.

126
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:19,756
Does she really expect to see
her coming out of the school?

127
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,780
I don't know.

128
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:24,321
As if Betty Ripsom's been hiding
in HomeEc for the last few weeks.

129
00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:25,877
Do you think they'll actually find her?

130
00:13:25,878 --> 00:13:26,878
Sure.

131
00:13:27,102 --> 00:13:29,551
In a ditch. All decomposed, covered
in worms and maggots, smelling...

132
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:30,744
like Eddie's mom's underwear.

133
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,167
Shut up!

134
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:35,312
She's not dead.
She m-m-m-missing.

135
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,331
Sorry Bill, she's missing.

136
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:41,933
You know the barrens
aren't that bad.

137
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:44,780
Who doesn't love splashing
around in shitty water.

138
00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:50,043
Nice frisbee, flamer.

139
00:13:50,242 --> 00:13:51,242
Give it back.

140
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:53,228
Fuckin' losers.

141
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:58,485
Loser.

142
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:01,497
You s-s-s-suck, Bowers.

143
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:02,854
Shut up, Bill.

144
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:12,024
Did you s-s-s-say
something, B-b-b-b-Billy.

145
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,467
You got a free ride this year
cuz of your little brother.

146
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,281
Ride's over, Denbrough.

147
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:28,543
This summer its gonna be a hurt-train,
for you and your faggot friends.

148
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:43,440
I wish he'd go missing.

149
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:45,128
He's probably the one doing it.

150
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:57,840
You not gonna let me go by?

151
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,759
Or is there a secret
password or something?

152
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:03,368
- Sorry.
- Sorry is not a...

153
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:07,473
Password.

154
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:18,364
Henry and his goons are
over by the west entrance.

155
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:19,655
So you should be fine.

156
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:20,979
I wasn't...

157
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:22,999
Everyone knows he's
looking for you.

158
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:26,607
What you listening to?

159
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:34,089
New Kids on the Block.

160
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,720
I don't even like them,
I was just..

161
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,054
Wait. You're the new kid, right?
Now I get it.

162
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:40,809
There's nothing to get.

163
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,993
I'm just messing with you.

164
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:45,609
I'm Beverly Marsh.

165
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:49,151
I know that because
we're in the same class.

166
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,501
Social Studies.
And you were...

167
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,036
I'm Ben. But pretty much
everybody just calls me...

168
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:57,625
The new kid.

169
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,936
Well, Ben...
There are worse things to be called.

170
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:02,889
Let me sign this.

171
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:26,161
Stay cool,
Ben from Soc class.

172
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,650
Yeah.

173
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:29,670
You too, Beverly.

174
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:31,888
Hang tough,
new kid on the block.

175
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:36,622
"Please don't go girl."

176
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:41,852
That's the name of another
New Kids on the Block song.

177
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:53,736
He thrusts his fists
against the post.

178
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:58,305
He thrusts his fists against the...

179
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:03,112
Shit.
P-p-post.

180
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,048
Need some help?

181
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:18,928
I thought we agreed.

182
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,920
- Before you say anything...
- Bill.

183
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,568
Let me s-s-s-show you
something first.

184
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,007
The barrens.

185
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,947
It's the only place th-that-that
Georgie could have ended.

186
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:51,469
He's gone, Bill.

187
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:56,935
But if the storm swept G-G-Georgie in,
we should have gone...

188
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:59,679
HE'S GONE! HE'S DEAD!

189
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:04,545
He's dead! There is nothing
we can do! Nothing!

190
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:11,133
Now take this down before
your mother sees it.

191
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:19,839
Next time you want to take
something from my office...

192
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,984
Ask.

193
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:30,499
I guess you get
your tunnels back.

194
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,484
Get in.

195
00:19:11,845 --> 00:19:12,872
Oh, Jesus.

196
00:19:43,989 --> 00:19:45,015
Mike.

197
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:50,875
Hurry up, son!

198
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:52,762
Help!
I'm burning!

199
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:56,502
Mike.

200
00:20:26,163 --> 00:20:28,083
Stay the fuck out of my town!

201
00:20:35,664 --> 00:20:36,664
Mike?

202
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:37,823
Are you okay?

203
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,075
You're not studying, Stanley.

204
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,922
How's it gonna look...

205
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:04,332
The rabbi's son can't finish
his own Torah reading.

206
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:06,848
Take the book to my office.

207
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:08,867
Obviously you're not using it.

208
00:23:04,796 --> 00:23:06,683
Everything but the
delicious deals, guys.

209
00:23:06,881 --> 00:23:07,381
My mom loves them.

210
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:11,181
Hey, first you said the barrens
and now you're saying the sewer.

211
00:23:11,512 --> 00:23:13,994
I mean, if we get caught?

212
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,676
We won't, Eds.
The sewers are public works.

213
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:18,132
We are the public, aren't we?

214
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:20,979
Hey Eddie, are these your
birth control pills?

215
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:24,753
Yes, I'm saving it for your sister.
This is private stuff.

216
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:28,659
<i>Hello, welcome to The
Children's Hour Derry.</i>

217
00:23:29,355 --> 00:23:32,963
Eddie dear, where you boys off to
in such a rush?

218
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,777
<i>Our word of the day is "clown".
They know what it means!</i>

219
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:39,153
Uhm, just m-m-my backyard,
Mrs. K.

220
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,272
I got a new...

221
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:47,595
A new croquet set.
Jeez, spit it out bubbler Bill.

222
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:48,793
Okay.

223
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:51,898
Oh and sweetie,
don't go rolling around in the grass,

224
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,785
especially if it's just been cut.

225
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,467
You know how bad your
allergies can get.

226
00:23:56,665 --> 00:23:58,089
Yes mom.
Come on.

227
00:23:58,287 --> 00:23:59,567
Aren't you forgetting something?

228
00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:02,591
<i>Water surrounds us.
Even it is upon us.</i>

229
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,450
<i>They do not believe me?</i>

230
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,072
<i>Try it at home.</i>

231
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:12,158
<i>Whenever you are outside...</i>

232
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:14,990
Do you want one
from me too, Mrs. K?

233
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:16,480
No.

234
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,228
Sorry mommy.

235
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:43,956
"Your hair is winter fire,
January embers...

236
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:46,075
"My heart burns there too."

237
00:24:46,108 --> 00:24:47,134
<i>Slower!</i>

238
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,121
<i>Hi-yo Silver awaaay!</i>

239
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:50,419
<i>Let's move on!</i>

240
00:24:50,544 --> 00:24:52,630
<i>Your old lady bike's too fast for us.</i>

241
00:24:53,855 --> 00:24:54,649
Found it.

242
00:24:54,848 --> 00:24:56,602
Isn't it summer vacation?

243
00:24:56,801 --> 00:24:59,648
I'd think you'd be ready to
take a break from the books.

244
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:00,939
I like it in here.

245
00:25:01,932 --> 00:25:04,746
A boy should be spending his
summer outside with friends.

246
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,328
Don't you have any friends?

247
00:25:08,321 --> 00:25:09,910
Can I have the book now?

248
00:28:12,997 --> 00:28:14,387
Egg boy!

249
00:28:18,227 --> 00:28:19,347
What on earth are you doing?

250
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,632
Where you off to, Tits?

251
00:28:44,843 --> 00:28:45,843
Got ya!

252
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,326
<i>Wait.</i>

253
00:28:47,988 --> 00:28:49,279
<i>- Hold him.
- Leave me alone!</i>

254
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,757
<i>- Hit him.
- You will not escape.</i>

255
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:51,901
Help!

256
00:28:52,622 --> 00:28:53,622
Hold him!

257
00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:57,356
- Hold him, Hockstetter.
- Grab him, Belch.

258
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:03,282
Just leave me alone.
- Look all that bulbing.

259
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:07,420
I'm gonna light his hair
like Michael Jackson.

260
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:09,115
Hold him.

261
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:11,326
Get off me! Get off me!

262
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,926
Help!

263
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,780
Help!

264
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:29,963
Okay, new kid.

265
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,460
This is why us locals call
this the kissing bridge.

266
00:29:32,843 --> 00:29:35,326
It's for two things: Sucking face...

267
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:38,272
and cutting names.

268
00:29:38,471 --> 00:29:39,762
Henry, please.

269
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:47,409
Wo-wo-wo. Henry!

270
00:29:47,608 --> 00:29:48,700
Shut up!

271
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:51,944
I'm gonna carve my whole
name into his cottage cheese.

272
00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:58,863
I'm gonna cut your fucking tits off.
I swear to god!

273
00:29:59,194 --> 00:30:00,194
Get him!

274
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:01,717
Come on!

275
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:06,351
Get him!

276
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:07,874
You can't run!

277
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:10,979
- No.
- We must find the fatso.

278
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,612
My knife.
My old man will kill me!

279
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,909
- You two, get him!
- Come on!

280
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:29,403
Move your fucking ass!

281
00:30:30,925 --> 00:30:33,342
Go that way.

282
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:37,116
He's down there.

283
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:11,180
I don't know.
I guess.

284
00:31:13,232 --> 00:31:17,238
That's poison ivy.
And that's poison ivy.

285
00:31:17,436 --> 00:31:18,595
And that's poison ivy.

286
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,482
Where?
Where's the poison ivy?

287
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,520
Nowhere. Not every fucking plant
is poison ivy, Stanley.

288
00:31:24,918 --> 00:31:26,403
Ok well I'm starting to get itchy now

289
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:28,358
and I'm pretty sure
this is not good for me.

290
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:30,976
Do you use the same
bathroom as your mother?

291
00:31:31,108 --> 00:31:32,234
Sometimes, yeah.

292
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,922
Then you probably have crabs.

293
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
That's so NOT funny.

294
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:41,403
Aren't you guys coming in?

295
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:44,184
Uh-uh that's gray water.

296
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:45,511
What the hell is gray water?

297
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:48,355
It's basically piss and shit.
So I'm just telling you...

298
00:31:48,454 --> 00:31:53,023
You guys are splashing around in
millions of gallons of Derry pee.

299
00:31:53,122 --> 00:31:54,248
Are, are you serious?

300
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:56,466
Doesn't smell like caca to me, Senor.

301
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,518
O-o-okay I can smell that from here.

302
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,937
It's probably just your breath
wafting back into your face.

303
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:03,549
Have you ever heard
of a staph infection?

304
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,910
I'll show you a "staff" infection.

305
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:06,562
That's so unsanitary.
These...

306
00:32:06,662 --> 00:32:08,846
you guys are like swimming
in a toilet bowl right now.

307
00:32:08,946 --> 00:32:10,336
Have you ever
heard of listeria?

308
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:13,315
Are you retarded?

309
00:32:13,382 --> 00:32:15,235
You're the reason we're
in this situation.

310
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:16,626
Guys!

311
00:32:18,877 --> 00:32:20,929
Shit.
Don't tell me that's...

312
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:22,618
No.

313
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:25,067
Georgie was wearing galoshes.

314
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:27,947
Who's sneaker is it?

315
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:32,085
It's Betty Ripsoms.

316
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:33,807
Shit!

317
00:32:33,906 --> 00:32:35,329
Shit, oh god, oh fuck

318
00:32:35,363 --> 00:32:36,521
I don't like this.

319
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,474
How do you think Betty feels...

320
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,752
Going around these tunnels
with only one fucking shoe.

321
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:47,445
What if she's still here?

322
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:54,099
Eddie, come on!

323
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:57,439
My mom will have an aneurysm if she
finds out we were playing down here.

324
00:32:57,511 --> 00:32:58,211
I'm serious.

325
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,727
Bill?

326
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,649
If I were Betty Ripsom,
I would want us to find me.

327
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:10,088
G-G-Georgie too.

328
00:33:11,578 --> 00:33:12,968
What if I don't want to find them?

329
00:33:14,855 --> 00:33:18,563
I mean, no offense, Bill,
but I do not want to end up like...

330
00:33:21,906 --> 00:33:23,266
I don't want to go missing either.

331
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,210
- He has a point.
- You too?

332
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:27,832
It's summer...

333
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:29,222
We're supposed
to be having fun.

334
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,036
This isn't funny.

335
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:33,858
This is scary and disgusting.

336
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:42,663
Holy shit,
what happened to you?

337
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:27,628
I hear you, tits.

338
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:47,424
Don't think you can stay
down here all damn day.

339
00:35:00,864 --> 00:35:03,314
You found us, Patrick.

340
00:35:03,413 --> 00:35:06,393
You found us, Patrick

341
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:10,339
Patrick.

342
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:27,255
Fuck.

343
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:00,399
I think it's great that
we're helping the new kid

344
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,139
but we also need to think
about our own safety.

345
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,229
I mean, he's bleeding all over

346
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,577
and you guys know there's an AIDS epidemic
happening right now as we speak, right?

347
00:36:05,578 --> 00:36:07,105
You know, my mom's friend
in New York City

348
00:36:07,135 --> 00:36:09,095
got it just by touching a
dirty pole in the subway

349
00:36:09,153 --> 00:36:12,464
and she got AIDS blood into her
system through a hangnail, a hangnail!

350
00:36:12,563 --> 00:36:15,245
And they can amputate legs and arms.

351
00:36:15,443 --> 00:36:18,191
But how do you amputate waist?

352
00:36:18,422 --> 00:36:20,805
You know that there are alleys full
of AIDS infected needles, right?

353
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:21,806
You. Know that.

354
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:25,639
Richie, wait here.
Come on.

355
00:36:30,141 --> 00:36:31,995
Glad I got to meet
you before you died.

356
00:36:40,006 --> 00:36:41,330
Good.

357
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,574
Can we afford all that?

358
00:36:44,674 --> 00:36:45,674
It's all we got.

359
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:47,090
You kidding me?

360
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,692
Wait, you have an
account here don't you?

361
00:36:52,188 --> 00:36:54,340
If my mom finds out I bought
all this stuff for myself,

362
00:36:55,035 --> 00:36:57,915
I'll spend the whole rest of
the week in the emergency room.

363
00:37:11,885 --> 00:37:13,011
See you later, dad.

364
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,096
See ya, Greta.

365
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:22,114
You okay?

366
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:25,557
I'm fine...
What's wrong with you?

367
00:37:26,153 --> 00:37:27,212
None of your business.

368
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,728
There's kid outside
looks like someone killed him.

369
00:37:30,622 --> 00:37:33,899
We need some s-s-s-supplies

370
00:37:33,998 --> 00:37:36,746
but we don't have
enough money.

371
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:44,264
I like your glasses, Mr. Keene.

372
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,111
You look just like Clark Kent.

373
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,488
I don't know about that.

374
00:37:50,587 --> 00:37:51,812
Can I try them on?

375
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:55,902
Sure.

376
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,615
What do you think?

377
00:38:04,674 --> 00:38:06,892
Well how about that,

378
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,441
you look just like Lois Lane.

379
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:12,759
Really?

380
00:38:17,552 --> 00:38:18,876
Well, here you go.

381
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:21,738
Shoot, I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

382
00:38:36,586 --> 00:38:37,811
Just suck the wound.

383
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:40,029
I need to focus right now.
You need to focus?

384
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,253
Yeah, can you go
get me something?

385
00:38:41,254 --> 00:38:43,472
Jesus.
Oh, what do you need?

386
00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:44,861
Go get my bifocals,
they're in my second fanny pack.

387
00:38:44,862 --> 00:38:46,484
Why do you have two fanny pack?

388
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:48,172
I need to focus right now,
it's a long story.

389
00:38:48,173 --> 00:38:49,265
I don't want to hear it.

390
00:39:02,308 --> 00:39:03,308
Uhmm, th-th-thanks.

391
00:39:03,831 --> 00:39:04,989
Even Steven.

392
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:07,439
Oh god, he's bleeding.

393
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:08,763
Ben from Soc?

394
00:39:08,863 --> 00:39:11,412
You have to suck the wound
before you apply the bandage.

395
00:39:11,478 --> 00:39:11,885
It's basic.

396
00:39:11,915 --> 00:39:13,431
You dont know what
you're talking about?

397
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,550
Are you okay,
that looks like it hurts.

398
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,668
No, I'm good.
I just fell.

399
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:19,158
Yeah, right into Henry Bowers.

400
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:20,912
Shut it, R-R-Richie!

401
00:39:21,012 --> 00:39:22,634
Why?
It's the truth.

402
00:39:23,692 --> 00:39:27,334
You sure they got
"The Right Stuff" to fix you up?

403
00:39:30,711 --> 00:39:33,193
You know w-w-w-w-we'll
take care of him.

404
00:39:33,292 --> 00:39:34,849
Thanks again, Beverly.

405
00:39:34,948 --> 00:39:37,928
Sure,
maybe I'll see you around.

406
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,801
Yeah, we were maybe thinking about
going to the q-q-q-quarry tomorrow,

407
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:43,820
if you wanna...

408
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:45,449
Come?

409
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:48,289
Good to know.
Thanks.

410
00:39:51,997 --> 00:39:53,851
Nice going,
bringing up Bowers in front of her.

411
00:39:54,049 --> 00:39:55,329
Yeah,
did you hear what she did?

412
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,426
What'd she do?

413
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:58,916
More what could she do...

414
00:39:59,015 --> 00:40:00,935
I heard that the list
is longer than my wang.

415
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,822
That's not saying much.

416
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:05,470
They're j-j-just rumors.

417
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:07,787
Anyway, Bill had her
back in third grade.

418
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:10,486
They kissed in the school play.

419
00:40:10,553 --> 00:40:13,102
The reviews said that you can't
fake that sort of passion.

420
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:15,551
Now, pip pip and tally-ho
my good fellows,

421
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,227
I do believe this chap
requires our utmost attention.

422
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:19,822
Now get in there Dr. K.
Come on, fix him up!

423
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,138
Why don't you shut the fuck up,
Einstein, because I know what I'm doing

424
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:23,859
and I don't want you
doing the British guy.

425
00:40:23,893 --> 00:40:25,350
Suck the wound. Get in there.

426
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:29,753
Toilet and tub water travels
down drains into sewers.

427
00:40:29,852 --> 00:40:33,427
Culverts are fun to play
with all your friends.

428
00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:38,128
Just keep the water into
drains and sewers reach.

429
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:43,027
When you are there with friends,
you can have fun like a clown!

430
00:40:43,127 --> 00:40:45,345
That's right, it is
the word of the day.

431
00:40:48,887 --> 00:40:49,887
Hi daddy.

432
00:40:50,145 --> 00:40:51,403
Hey Bevvie.

433
00:40:51,899 --> 00:40:53,091
What you got there?

434
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:56,732
Just some things.

435
00:40:57,295 --> 00:40:58,619
Like what?

436
00:41:20,236 --> 00:41:22,520
Tell me you're still my little girl.

437
00:41:23,116 --> 00:41:24,374
Yes daddy.

438
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:28,512
Good.

439
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:31,326
A high ball to the left.
His last batting.

440
00:41:31,524 --> 00:41:33,014
He brushed the post.

441
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:36,854
Wade Booggs, of course,
leads the league in such long shots.

442
00:41:51,453 --> 00:41:55,127
This is what you did. This is what...

443
00:42:30,118 --> 00:42:31,343
Do it!

444
00:42:37,202 --> 00:42:38,229
Oh my god!

445
00:42:38,957 --> 00:42:40,447
So easy.
- Poor tree.

446
00:42:40,546 --> 00:42:41,870
So easy!

447
00:42:42,698 --> 00:42:44,551
Oh my god, that was terrible. I win.

448
00:42:44,651 --> 00:42:45,743
You won?
Yeah.

449
00:42:45,842 --> 00:42:47,994
You see my loogie,
It went the farthest.

450
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:49,782
It's about distance.
- It's mass. Always been mass.

451
00:42:49,815 --> 00:42:51,106
What is mass?

452
00:42:51,305 --> 00:42:52,665
It doesn't matter how far it goes.

453
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,641
It's how cool it looks,
and it's green or it's white.

454
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:57,098
Alright.

455
00:42:57,131 --> 00:42:58,455
Who's first?

456
00:43:02,758 --> 00:43:03,851
I'll go.

457
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:09,287
Sissies!

458
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,477
What the fuck?

459
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,164
Ahhh, holy shit,
we just got shown off by a girl.

460
00:43:21,363 --> 00:43:22,753
We have to do that now?

461
00:43:22,886 --> 00:43:23,886
Yes.

462
00:43:24,077 --> 00:43:25,104
Come on!

463
00:43:25,997 --> 00:43:27,355
Oh shit!

464
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:39,404
I already won! Already we won!

465
00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:43,112
They fell! Yes!

466
00:44:10,687 --> 00:44:11,878
Oh, shit! W-w-w-wait, wait, wait.

467
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:13,919
- Ah fuck! What was that?
- It just touched my foot.

468
00:44:16,712 --> 00:44:17,408
Does that work?

469
00:44:17,507 --> 00:44:19,261
- Where?
- Here.

470
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,519
It's a turtle.

471
00:44:53,722 --> 00:44:55,874
News flash, Ben,
School's out for summa.

472
00:44:56,073 --> 00:44:57,393
Oh that, that's not school stuff.

473
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:00,277
- Who sent you this?
- No one.

474
00:45:00,674 --> 00:45:01,767
No one.

475
00:45:05,772 --> 00:45:07,052
What's with the history project?

476
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:11,930
Oh well, when I first moved here,
I really didn't have anyone to hang out with

477
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,048
so I just started spending
time in the library.

478
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:16,266
You went to the library?

479
00:45:17,642 --> 00:45:18,933
On purpose?

480
00:45:19,032 --> 00:45:20,422
I wanna see.

481
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:24,792
What's the Black Spot?

482
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:26,744
The Black Spot was a nightclub
that was burned down years ago

483
00:45:26,745 --> 00:45:27,838
by that racist cult.

484
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:29,599
The what?

485
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:30,938
Don't you watch Geraldo?

486
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:34,149
Y-y-y-y-your hair...

487
00:45:36,532 --> 00:45:38,220
Your hair looks beautiful. Beverly.

488
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:42,392
Oh, right thanks.

489
00:45:45,801 --> 00:45:47,721
Here, pass.

490
00:45:52,223 --> 00:45:53,746
Why's it all murders and missing kids?

491
00:45:54,441 --> 00:45:56,726
Derry's not like any town
I've ever been in before.

492
00:45:57,752 --> 00:46:00,532
They did a study once...
And it turns out..

493
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:04,803
People die or disappear
six times the national average.

494
00:46:06,921 --> 00:46:08,345
You read that?

495
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:10,662
Not just grown-ups.

496
00:46:10,795 --> 00:46:12,450
Kids are like worse

497
00:46:12,946 --> 00:46:14,138
way, way worse.

498
00:46:15,826 --> 00:46:18,706
I've got more stuff,
if you want to see it.

499
00:46:49,195 --> 00:46:50,784
Do not freak out, just tell us.

500
00:46:51,082 --> 00:46:53,499
Yes. I heard he has a roller
coaster and a pit chimpanzee...

501
00:46:53,598 --> 00:46:56,279
and like old guy's fucking bone. Yeah.

502
00:46:57,901 --> 00:46:59,093
Woah- woah- woah.

503
00:46:59,391 --> 00:47:00,550
Wow!

504
00:47:00,616 --> 00:47:01,675
Cool, huh?

505
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,555
No, nothing cool.

506
00:47:04,754 --> 00:47:06,674
There's nothing cool.

507
00:47:08,362 --> 00:47:11,209
Well this is cool, wait, no it's not.

508
00:47:11,308 --> 00:47:12,834
What's that?

509
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:15,678
That? That's the charter
for Derry Township.

510
00:47:15,877 --> 00:47:17,399
Nerd alert.

511
00:47:17,565 --> 00:47:20,015
Actually, it's really interesting.

512
00:47:20,114 --> 00:47:21,714
Derry started as a
beaver trapping camp.

513
00:47:21,769 --> 00:47:24,153
Still is, am I right, boys?

514
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:27,033
Ninety-one people signed
the charter that made Derry.

515
00:47:27,132 --> 00:47:31,038
But later that winter,
they all disappeared without a trace.

516
00:47:31,171 --> 00:47:32,528
The entire camp?

517
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,514
There were rumors of Indians...

518
00:47:34,613 --> 00:47:36,898
but no sign of an attack.

519
00:47:37,891 --> 00:47:40,738
Everybody thought it was
a plague or something.

520
00:47:40,936 --> 00:47:42,227
But it's like...

521
00:47:42,923 --> 00:47:45,803
one day everybody just
woke up and left.

522
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:51,165
The only clue was a trail bloody
clothes leading to the well-house.

523
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:53,847
Jesus, we can do Darren
"Unsolved Mysteries".

524
00:47:53,946 --> 00:47:55,586
- Let's do it. You are brilliant.
- Maybe.

525
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,566
I don't know.

526
00:48:05,665 --> 00:48:08,148
Maybe he should just trying
to make friends, Stanley.

527
00:48:08,777 --> 00:48:10,233
Where was the well house?

528
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:13,477
I don't know, somewhere
in town, I guess.

529
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:14,967
Why?

530
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:16,357
Nothing.

531
00:48:18,973 --> 00:48:24,206
??Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
No one knows my pain??

532
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:17,103
Eddie...

533
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,863
What are you looking for?

534
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,980
Fuck. My mom will kill me.

535
00:49:41,136 --> 00:49:43,586
Do you think this will help me, Eddie?

536
00:49:58,582 --> 00:50:01,230
Help!

537
00:50:21,691 --> 00:50:23,744
Where are you going, Eds?

538
00:50:24,373 --> 00:50:27,021
If you lived here,
you'd be home by now.

539
00:50:29,272 --> 00:50:31,556
Come join the clown, Eds.

540
00:50:32,152 --> 00:50:33,608
You'll float down here.

541
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,959
We all float down here,

542
00:50:36,157 --> 00:50:37,449
Yes we do.

543
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:35,281
"Your hair is winter fire...

544
00:51:36,075 --> 00:51:38,426
"January embers..."

545
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,703
"My heart burns there too."

546
00:51:54,415 --> 00:51:55,739
Beverly...

547
00:51:59,711 --> 00:52:01,698
Beverly.

548
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,247
Help me.

549
00:52:08,782 --> 00:52:10,139
Please help me.

550
00:52:14,112 --> 00:52:18,382
We all want to meet you, Beverly.

551
00:52:19,276 --> 00:52:22,950
We all float down here.

552
00:52:26,757 --> 00:52:29,935
Hello. Who you are?

553
00:52:30,134 --> 00:52:32,153
- I'm Veronica.
- Betty Rapsom.

554
00:52:32,286 --> 00:52:33,974
Patrick Hockstetter.

555
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:35,596
Come closer.

556
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:38,013
- You want to see?
- We float.

557
00:52:38,112 --> 00:52:40,197
We changed.

558
00:53:50,179 --> 00:53:51,205
Daddy!

559
00:53:51,304 --> 00:53:52,595
Help!

560
00:53:52,794 --> 00:53:54,184
Help!

561
00:54:30,502 --> 00:54:31,694
What the hell's goin' on?

562
00:54:35,302 --> 00:54:36,527
The sink...

563
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:41,559
There's blood, it's...

564
00:54:41,956 --> 00:54:43,777
What blood?

565
00:54:45,233 --> 00:54:49,504
The sink,
you don't see it?

566
00:54:50,894 --> 00:54:52,019
There was blood.

567
00:55:00,891 --> 00:55:02,447
You worry me, Bevvie.

568
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:05,724
You worry me a lot.

569
00:55:05,824 --> 00:55:08,704
But you don't see?

570
00:55:08,902 --> 00:55:11,187
Why'd you do this to your hair?

571
00:55:12,478 --> 00:55:14,563
Makes you look like a boy.

572
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:29,578
I lost it, Billy.
Don't be mad.

573
00:58:32,524 --> 00:58:34,907
I'm not mad at you.

574
00:58:43,614 --> 00:58:45,600
Just floated off.

575
00:58:50,433 --> 00:58:53,048
But, Bill...
If you come with me...

576
00:58:53,247 --> 00:58:55,399
You'll float too.

577
00:58:55,597 --> 00:58:56,789
Georgie.

578
00:58:57,848 --> 00:58:59,768
You'll float too!

579
00:58:59,868 --> 00:59:01,755
You'll float too!

580
00:59:01,953 --> 00:59:03,774
You'll float too!

581
00:59:04,006 --> 00:59:07,084
You'll float too!

582
00:59:07,283 --> 00:59:13,837
You'll float too!

583
00:59:13,937 --> 00:59:15,592
You'll float too!

584
00:59:16,287 --> 00:59:17,909
You'll float too!

585
00:59:55,288 --> 00:59:57,110
I-I need to show you something.

586
00:59:58,509 --> 00:59:59,800
What is it?

587
00:59:59,899 --> 01:00:01,090
More than we saw at the quarry?

588
01:00:01,091 --> 01:00:02,349
Shut up! Just shut up, Richie.

589
01:00:03,011 --> 01:00:06,619
My dad will kill me if he finds out
that I had boys in the apartment.

590
01:00:07,414 --> 01:00:09,400
W-we'll leave a lookout.

591
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:11,717
Now Richie, just s-s-s-stay here.

592
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:14,001
Woah, woah, woah,
what if her dad comes back?

593
01:00:14,829 --> 01:00:17,213
Do what you always do.
Start talking.

594
01:00:19,265 --> 01:00:20,490
It is a gift.

595
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:30,752
In there...

596
01:00:32,109 --> 01:00:33,698
What is it?

597
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:35,122
You'll see.

598
01:00:35,221 --> 01:00:37,075
Great, bringing us to the bathroom.

599
01:00:37,174 --> 01:00:39,425
You know that 89% of
the worse accidents

600
01:00:39,624 --> 01:00:41,478
occur in the bathroom and kitchen.

601
01:00:41,676 --> 01:00:44,490
And that's where all the
bacterian and fungi are...

602
01:00:44,589 --> 01:00:46,774
and it is not a hygienic place...

603
01:00:50,283 --> 01:00:51,607
I knew it!

604
01:00:51,806 --> 01:00:52,932
Do you see it?

605
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:54,031
Yes.

606
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,245
What happened in here?

607
01:00:56,275 --> 01:01:00,049
My dad couldn't see it,
I thought that I might be crazy.

608
01:01:00,976 --> 01:01:04,286
Well if you're crazy,
then we're all crazy.

609
01:01:04,485 --> 01:01:07,597
We c-c-c-can't leave it like this.

610
01:02:21,815 --> 01:02:23,901
Alright, so you never went to
the Derry Summer Fair?

611
01:02:23,967 --> 01:02:26,086
No, I don't.

612
01:02:27,178 --> 01:02:28,436
That I know.

613
01:02:30,224 --> 01:02:32,442
Well, I-I go there every year...

614
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,785
but one time with Richie,
Technically I won because I hit the target.

615
01:02:35,984 --> 01:02:39,592
But there were so many prizes\
I didn't know which to pick-pick.

616
01:02:42,994 --> 01:02:45,212
It's not true, you know...

617
01:02:45,411 --> 01:02:46,669
What they say about me.

618
01:02:49,449 --> 01:02:51,733
I was only ever kissed by one guy.

619
01:02:54,647 --> 01:02:56,500
It was a long time ago.

620
01:02:57,494 --> 01:02:59,480
It was a nice kiss though.

621
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:06,067
"January embers."

622
01:03:09,808 --> 01:03:11,695
W-w-w-was that in the play?

623
01:03:13,714 --> 01:03:15,469
No, the poem.

624
01:03:17,124 --> 01:03:20,236
Oh, I really don't
know p-p-poetry.

625
01:03:23,513 --> 01:03:25,599
Oh, I just..

626
01:03:27,717 --> 01:03:28,744
Never mind.

627
01:03:34,835 --> 01:03:37,615
Oh, Just so you know..

628
01:03:37,715 --> 01:03:39,900
I never believed any of the rumors.

629
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:44,236
None of us losers do.

630
01:03:46,818 --> 01:03:47,977
We like hanging with you.

631
01:03:50,724 --> 01:03:51,949
Thanks.

632
01:03:52,049 --> 01:03:54,068
You should not thank us too much

633
01:03:54,267 --> 01:03:56,286
hanging out with us
makes you a loser too.

634
01:03:57,974 --> 01:03:59,365
I can take that.

635
01:04:04,432 --> 01:04:06,452
No, I love being
your personal doorman.

636
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:08,404
Really. Could you idiots
have taken any longer?

637
01:04:08,405 --> 01:04:10,391
Shut up, Richie.
- Yeah, shut up, Richie.

638
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:12,807
Oh okay, trash the
trash-mouth, I get it.

639
01:04:13,105 --> 01:04:15,059
Hey I wasn't the one
scrubbing the bathroom floor

640
01:04:15,158 --> 01:04:18,435
imagining that her sink went all
Eddie's mom's vagina on halloween.

641
01:04:18,634 --> 01:04:20,521
She didn't imagine.

642
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:27,605
I s-s-saw something too.

643
01:04:28,797 --> 01:04:29,922
You saw blood, too?

644
01:04:31,809 --> 01:04:32,935
Not blood,

645
01:04:34,755 --> 01:04:38,794
I saw G-G-G-Georgie.

646
01:04:40,317 --> 01:04:42,369
It seemed so real,

647
01:04:42,568 --> 01:04:44,488
I mean it seemed like
him but there was this...

648
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:46,448
A clown.

649
01:04:51,572 --> 01:04:52,863
Yeah, I saw him too.

650
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,529
Wait, can only virgins see this stuff?

651
01:05:02,662 --> 01:05:04,218
Is that why
I'm not seeing this shit?

652
01:05:07,396 --> 01:05:08,819
Oh shit, that's Belch Huggins car.

653
01:05:09,746 --> 01:05:11,241
We, we should
probably get outta here.

654
01:05:11,271 --> 01:05:11,586
Yes.

655
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,016
Wait isn't that the home
schooled kids bike?

656
01:05:14,215 --> 01:05:15,274
Yeah, that's Mikes.

657
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,783
We have to help him.

658
01:05:18,883 --> 01:05:20,174
We should?

659
01:05:20,372 --> 01:05:21,465
Yes.

660
01:05:28,483 --> 01:05:30,039
Come on.

661
01:05:31,793 --> 01:05:32,588
Take that!

662
01:05:32,786 --> 01:05:34,408
- Take that, bitch!
- Damn fool!

663
01:05:34,508 --> 01:05:36,196
- Bitch!
- Motherfucker!

664
01:05:36,295 --> 01:05:37,520
Take that bitch!

665
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:39,910
Damned...

666
01:05:40,433 --> 01:05:41,360
What are you going to do?

667
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:42,390
Get up!

668
01:05:45,664 --> 01:05:46,855
Raise that ass!

669
01:05:48,279 --> 01:05:49,279
Fucking idiot!

670
01:05:58,144 --> 01:05:59,304
Fucking smack!

671
01:05:59,402 --> 01:06:00,494
Ugh.

672
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:05,824
- Nice throw.
- Thanks.

673
01:06:11,948 --> 01:06:13,372
You losers are trying too hard.

674
01:06:14,265 --> 01:06:15,325
She'll do you,

675
01:06:15,523 --> 01:06:17,245
You just gotta ask nicely

676
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:19,992
like I did.

677
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,408
The fuck?

678
01:06:31,181 --> 01:06:32,406
Come on, get him!

679
01:06:32,605 --> 01:06:33,896
ROCK WAR!

680
01:06:35,948 --> 01:06:37,835
- Give them hard!
- Watch out!

681
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:40,020
Drop dead, you fuckers.

682
01:06:44,562 --> 01:06:45,787
Eddie!

683
01:06:48,998 --> 01:06:50,024
Get out of here!

684
01:06:52,871 --> 01:06:53,897
Shit!

685
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,513
FUCK YOU BITCH!

686
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:01,809
Come on guys!

687
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:25,596
GO BLOW YOUR DAD,
YOU MULLET-WEARING ASSHOLE!

688
01:07:34,832 --> 01:07:36,652
Thanks guys,
but you shouldn't have done that,

689
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:38,274
he'll be after you guys too now.

690
01:07:38,473 --> 01:07:42,015
Ah, no-no, Bowers?
He's always after us.

691
01:07:42,512 --> 01:07:46,617
I guess that's one th-th-thing
we all have in common.

692
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,026
Yeah, homeschool.
Welcome to the loser's club.

693
01:07:54,264 --> 01:07:55,290
Here.

694
01:08:00,255 --> 01:08:03,055
They said they found part of his hand
all chewed up near the standpipe.

695
01:08:04,162 --> 01:08:06,015
He asked to borrow a pencil once.

696
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,504
It's like she's been f-f-f-forgotten

697
01:08:12,603 --> 01:08:14,953
because Corcoran's missing.

698
01:08:16,741 --> 01:08:17,800
Is it ever gonna end?

699
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:19,191
What the fuck, dude?

700
01:08:19,588 --> 01:08:20,978
What you guys talk about?

701
01:08:21,409 --> 01:08:23,196
What they always talk about.

702
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:24,818
I actually think it will end,

703
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:26,573
for a little while, at least.

704
01:08:26,771 --> 01:08:27,798
What do you mean?

705
01:08:29,056 --> 01:08:30,777
So I was going over all
of my data research

706
01:08:30,976 --> 01:08:32,631
and I charted out all
of the big events.

707
01:08:32,697 --> 01:08:34,849
The Ironworks explosion in 1908.

708
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:36,736
The Bradley Gang in '35

709
01:08:36,934 --> 01:08:39,053
and The Black Spot in '62.

710
01:08:39,152 --> 01:08:41,105
And now the kids being...

711
01:08:44,151 --> 01:08:46,799
I realized that this
stuff seems to happen

712
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:48,521
every 27 years.

713
01:08:52,493 --> 01:08:54,115
Ok, so let me get this straight.

714
01:08:54,215 --> 01:08:56,499
IT comes out from wherever
to eat kids for like a year

715
01:08:56,598 --> 01:08:58,584
and then what?
IT just goes into hibernation?

716
01:08:58,783 --> 01:09:01,133
Maybe it's like...
What do you call it?

717
01:09:01,332 --> 01:09:02,689
Cicadas.

718
01:09:02,788 --> 01:09:04,868
You know, the bugs that come
out once every 17 years.

719
01:09:05,966 --> 01:09:07,754
My grandfather thinks
this town is cursed.

720
01:09:08,813 --> 01:09:09,873
He says that..

721
01:09:10,071 --> 01:09:12,031
all the bad things that
happened in this town

722
01:09:12,057 --> 01:09:13,713
are because of one thing.

723
01:09:13,911 --> 01:09:16,560
An evil thing that feeds
off the people of Derry.

724
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:18,943
But it can't be one thing.

725
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:21,691
We all saw something different.

726
01:09:22,386 --> 01:09:23,412
Maybe.

727
01:09:23,611 --> 01:09:26,060
Or maybe IT knows what scares
us most and that's what we see.

728
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,245
I-I saw a leper.

729
01:09:29,404 --> 01:09:31,456
He was like a walking infection.

730
01:09:32,218 --> 01:09:33,343
But you didn't.

731
01:09:35,065 --> 01:09:36,620
Because IT isn't real.

732
01:09:37,018 --> 01:09:38,309
None of this is.

733
01:09:39,169 --> 01:09:40,461
Not Eddie's leper

734
01:09:40,659 --> 01:09:42,745
or Bill seeing Georgie

735
01:09:43,241 --> 01:09:45,459
or the woman I keep seeing.

736
01:09:45,757 --> 01:09:46,757
Is she hot?

737
01:09:48,405 --> 01:09:49,531
No. Richie.

738
01:09:50,506 --> 01:09:51,506
She's not hot.

739
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:54,611
Her face is all messed up.

740
01:09:56,034 --> 01:09:58,484
None of this makes any sense.

741
01:09:59,312 --> 01:10:00,801
They're all like bad dreams.

742
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,734
I don't think so, I know the difference
between a bad dream and real life, okay?

743
01:10:06,628 --> 01:10:08,879
What did you see? You
saw something too?

744
01:10:08,978 --> 01:10:10,004
Yes.

745
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:14,407
You guys know that burnt
down house on Harris Avenue?

746
01:10:16,095 --> 01:10:18,280
I was inside when it burned down.

747
01:10:21,491 --> 01:10:22,683
Before I rescued...

748
01:10:22,782 --> 01:10:26,258
my mom and dad were trapped
in the next room over from me.

749
01:10:26,391 --> 01:10:30,992
They were pushing and
pounding on the door

750
01:10:33,309 --> 01:10:34,799
trying to get to me.

751
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:35,998
Hurry up, son!

752
01:10:36,289 --> 01:10:37,514
I'm burning!

753
01:10:38,507 --> 01:10:39,798
But it was too hot.

754
01:10:41,453 --> 01:10:43,538
When firefighters found them

755
01:10:46,749 --> 01:10:51,285
the skin on their hands
melted down to the bone.

756
01:10:54,032 --> 01:10:55,654
We're all afraid of something.

757
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:57,574
Got that right.

758
01:10:58,203 --> 01:11:00,256
Why Rich? What are you afraid of?

759
01:11:03,666 --> 01:11:04,957
Clowns.

760
01:11:33,525 --> 01:11:34,525
Okay.

761
01:11:35,611 --> 01:11:36,736
Look.

762
01:11:38,358 --> 01:11:38,858
Storm drain.

763
01:11:38,517 --> 01:11:40,604
That's were G-G-G-Georgie disappeared,

764
01:11:41,702 --> 01:11:43,589
there's the Ironworks,

765
01:11:43,787 --> 01:11:45,244
and the Black Spot.

766
01:11:46,138 --> 01:11:49,481
Everywhere IT happens it's-it's
all connected by the sewers

767
01:11:52,328 --> 01:11:53,408
and they all meet up at the

768
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:54,612
the well-house.

769
01:11:57,757 --> 01:11:59,237
You mean the house on Neibolt Street.

770
01:11:59,876 --> 01:12:02,888
You mean the creepy-ass house where all
the junkies and hobos like to sleep?

771
01:12:04,179 --> 01:12:05,537
I hate that place.

772
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:08,317
Always feels like it's watching me.

773
01:12:08,814 --> 01:12:09,906
That's where I saw IT.

774
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:12,257
There I saw a clown.

775
01:12:15,302 --> 01:12:16,726
Tha-tha-tha-that's where IT lives.

776
01:12:18,712 --> 01:12:21,029
I can't imagine anything
ever wanting to live there.

777
01:12:21,195 --> 01:12:22,519
Can we stop talking about this?

778
01:12:22,618 --> 01:12:24,604
I-I-I can barely breathe.

779
01:12:24,803 --> 01:12:25,995
It's summer.

780
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,915
We're kids, I can barely breathe

781
01:12:28,014 --> 01:12:29,371
I'm having a fucking asthma attack

782
01:12:29,901 --> 01:12:31,126
and fuck doing this.

783
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,311
What the hell! Put the map back!

784
01:12:41,752 --> 01:12:43,142
What happened?

785
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:44,831
What's going on?

786
01:12:45,658 --> 01:12:46,784
I don't know, look!

787
01:12:48,936 --> 01:12:49,936
Guys...

788
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,245
Georgie.

789
01:12:58,966 --> 01:12:59,966
Bill?

790
01:13:16,677 --> 01:13:17,802
WHAT THE FUCK!

791
01:13:18,564 --> 01:13:19,821
It's IT.

792
01:13:21,046 --> 01:13:24,092
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

793
01:13:24,489 --> 01:13:25,714
I DON'T FUCKING KNOW!

794
01:13:30,117 --> 01:13:31,937
Turn it off!

795
01:13:32,136 --> 01:13:34,023
Yes, Turn it off!

796
01:13:53,223 --> 01:13:54,415
Run, Stanley!

797
01:13:56,567 --> 01:13:57,924
What is that?

798
01:13:58,354 --> 01:13:59,354
What's up?

799
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:15,403
Thanks, Ben.

800
01:14:17,521 --> 01:14:18,879
IT saw us.

801
01:14:19,905 --> 01:14:21,593
IT saw us and
IT knows where we are.

802
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:23,116
IT always knew.

803
01:14:23,513 --> 01:14:25,102
S-s-so let's go.

804
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,254
Go?

805
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,877
Go where?

806
01:14:28,907 --> 01:14:30,035
Neibolt.

807
01:14:30,831 --> 01:14:33,910
That's where G-g-g-Georgie is.

808
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:35,400
After that?

809
01:14:36,095 --> 01:14:38,611
Yeah, it's summer, we
should be outside...

810
01:14:38,644 --> 01:14:41,524
If you say it's summer one
more f-f-f-fucking time.

811
01:14:47,284 --> 01:14:48,284
Bill?

812
01:14:49,237 --> 01:14:50,462
Wait!

813
01:15:20,652 --> 01:15:24,261
"He t-t-t-thrusts his fists.

814
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,280
"Against the p-p-post"

815
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:29,855
"and still insists he
sees the g-g-g-ghost."

816
01:15:31,014 --> 01:15:32,040
Bill!

817
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,953
Bill, you can't go in there.

818
01:15:35,152 --> 01:15:36,152
This is crazy.

819
01:15:36,244 --> 01:15:38,065
Look, you don't have
to come in with me,

820
01:15:38,959 --> 01:15:42,302
but what happens when
another Georgie goes missing,

821
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:46,566
or another Betty or another
Ed Corcoran or one of us?

822
01:15:47,261 --> 01:15:50,571
Are you just going to pretend it didn't
happen like everyone else in this town?

823
01:15:51,598 --> 01:15:53,551
Because I can't.

824
01:15:56,133 --> 01:16:00,403
I go home and all I see is
that Georgie isn't there,

825
01:16:01,562 --> 01:16:05,468
his clothes, his toys,
his stupid stuffed animals

826
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:07,785
but he isn't.

827
01:16:09,176 --> 01:16:11,195
So walking into this house

828
01:16:14,141 --> 01:16:15,896
for me...

829
01:16:16,127 --> 01:16:18,511
it's easier that walking into my own.

830
01:16:22,947 --> 01:16:23,947
Wow.

831
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:25,066
What?

832
01:16:25,397 --> 01:16:26,952
He didn't stutter once.

833
01:16:30,859 --> 01:16:31,984
Wait!

834
01:16:34,964 --> 01:16:38,208
Uhhh, shouldn't we have
some people keep watch,

835
01:16:40,525 --> 01:16:43,140
You know.
Just in case something bad happens?

836
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:48,635
Wh-wh-wh-who wants to stay out here?

837
01:16:56,249 --> 01:16:57,249
Fuck.

838
01:17:07,182 --> 01:17:09,135
I can't believe
I pulled the short straw

839
01:17:10,227 --> 01:17:12,081
You guys are lucky
you're not measuring dicks.

840
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,670
Shut up, Richie.

841
01:17:17,146 --> 01:17:18,801
I can smell that.

842
01:17:19,298 --> 01:17:20,787
Don't breathe through your mouth.

843
01:17:20,986 --> 01:17:21,986
Home come?

844
01:17:22,575 --> 01:17:24,098
Cause then you're eating it.

845
01:17:50,846 --> 01:17:51,872
What?

846
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,289
It, it says I'm missing.

847
01:17:56,043 --> 01:17:57,433
Y-y-y-you're not missing, Richie.

848
01:17:59,353 --> 01:18:02,034
Then why's it say it there, it's my shirt,
that's my hair, that's my face...

849
01:18:02,035 --> 01:18:03,127
Calm down, this isn't real.

850
01:18:03,227 --> 01:18:04,715
That's my name, that's my age,
that's the date...

851
01:18:05,016 --> 01:18:06,042
This isn't real, Richie.

852
01:18:06,109 --> 01:18:07,731
What the fuck?
It says I'm missing.

853
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:10,478
- Am I missing? Will I disappear?
- Take it easy. -What the fuck.

854
01:18:10,578 --> 01:18:12,365
Look at me, Richie. Look at me.

855
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:15,378
That isn't real.

856
01:18:15,576 --> 01:18:17,496
IT's playing tricks on you.

857
01:18:18,324 --> 01:18:19,615
Hello?

858
01:18:22,992 --> 01:18:24,415
Hello?

859
01:18:28,685 --> 01:18:30,639
Help me please!

860
01:19:07,053 --> 01:19:08,053
Betty?

861
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:09,635
Ripsom?

862
01:19:20,029 --> 01:19:21,221
Eddie...

863
01:19:23,869 --> 01:19:26,352
What are you looking for?

864
01:19:28,603 --> 01:19:30,225
Guys, do you hear that?

865
01:19:51,511 --> 01:19:54,524
She was just here,
where the fuck did she go?

866
01:19:55,318 --> 01:19:56,344
Guys?

867
01:20:04,521 --> 01:20:06,011
Guys!

868
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:09,652
- Guys!
- Eddie!

869
01:20:11,539 --> 01:20:13,062
What the fuck!

870
01:20:22,397 --> 01:20:25,145
Time to take your pill, Eddie.

871
01:20:38,684 --> 01:20:41,167
- Eddie. Open the door!
- Richie.

872
01:20:42,028 --> 01:20:43,186
Are you okay?

873
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:45,080
Eddie, what's going on?

874
01:20:45,503 --> 01:20:46,503
Eds.

875
01:20:47,225 --> 01:20:48,284
Eddie.

876
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:49,906
Hiya Richie.

877
01:20:50,568 --> 01:20:51,661
Eddie.

878
01:20:54,044 --> 01:20:55,236
Eddie.

879
01:21:00,499 --> 01:21:01,791
Eddie.

880
01:21:02,552 --> 01:21:04,008
Where the fuck are you.

881
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:07,054
We're not playing hide
and seek, dipshit.

882
01:21:10,563 --> 01:21:11,589
Richie?

883
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:16,058
Richie!

884
01:21:16,158 --> 01:21:17,349
Bill, come on
open the door.

885
01:21:17,449 --> 01:21:18,449
It won't open.

886
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,229
- What's going on?
Richie! - I can't!

887
01:21:20,329 --> 01:21:21,421
Open the door, Rich.

888
01:21:27,512 --> 01:21:28,638
Oh shit.

889
01:21:58,199 --> 01:21:59,424
Stupid clowns.

890
01:22:07,237 --> 01:22:08,627
Oh fuck.

891
01:22:48,782 --> 01:22:50,007
Beep-beep, Richie.

892
01:22:55,436 --> 01:22:56,436
Let's get out of here.

893
01:23:03,613 --> 01:23:04,870
You wanna play loogie?

894
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:56,332
Time to float.

895
01:24:34,103 --> 01:24:35,163
Where's my shoe?

896
01:24:40,161 --> 01:24:41,321
Where the fuck were her legs?

897
01:24:42,181 --> 01:24:44,002
What was that?

898
01:24:44,233 --> 01:24:45,259
This isn't real.

899
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:46,716
Remember the missing kid poster

900
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:48,437
That wasn't real,
so this isn't real.

901
01:24:50,192 --> 01:24:53,337
Tasty, tasty, beautiful fear.

902
01:24:56,647 --> 01:24:57,706
Come on. Ready?

903
01:24:57,806 --> 01:24:58,806
No.

904
01:25:01,215 --> 01:25:02,242
No.

905
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:07,174
No!

906
01:25:08,267 --> 01:25:09,491
Oh thank fuck.

907
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:11,080
Where's Eddie?

908
01:25:11,378 --> 01:25:12,802
Help!

909
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:16,145
Eddie!

910
01:25:17,966 --> 01:25:19,687
Oh fuck.

911
01:25:19,787 --> 01:25:20,912
Eddie?

912
01:25:23,163 --> 01:25:25,348
This isn't real enough for you, Billy?

913
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:28,394
I'm not real enough for you?

914
01:25:28,592 --> 01:25:30,181
Holy shit!

915
01:25:30,347 --> 01:25:32,797
It was real enough for Georgie.

916
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:46,733
Get Eddie - Get Eddie.

917
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:52,295
Woah. Fuck!
Let's get outta here.

918
01:25:59,015 --> 01:26:00,372
Go for Eddie. Come on!

919
01:26:00,471 --> 01:26:01,564
Guys, watch out!

920
01:26:01,729 --> 01:26:03,815
Don't - Eddie, look at me.

921
01:26:03,914 --> 01:26:05,735
Guys!

922
01:26:05,834 --> 01:26:07,258
No!

923
01:26:21,956 --> 01:26:23,081
Let's get outta here!

924
01:26:24,207 --> 01:26:25,597
Don't let IT get away

925
01:26:36,058 --> 01:26:37,448
Bill, we have to help Eddie.

926
01:26:37,647 --> 01:26:39,236
Nooooo, Nooooo!

927
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:42,990
- I put the arm in place.
- Don't fucking touch me!

928
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:46,419
- Well, one, two, three.
- Don't fucking touch me!

929
01:26:48,505 --> 01:26:49,796
Shit!

930
01:26:51,749 --> 01:26:54,000
You, you did this.

931
01:26:54,497 --> 01:26:56,317
You know how delicate he is.

932
01:26:56,417 --> 01:26:59,429
We were attacked,
M-M-M-Mrs K. - Don't

933
01:27:00,356 --> 01:27:02,144
Don't try to blame anyone else...

934
01:27:04,726 --> 01:27:05,984
Let me - Get back!

935
01:27:08,587 --> 01:27:10,573
Oh, I've heard of you Miss Marsh...

936
01:27:10,706 --> 01:27:13,685
and I don't want a dirty girl
like you touching my son.

937
01:27:16,168 --> 01:27:17,691
Ms. K, I...

938
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:20,836
No, you are all monsters!
All of you..

939
01:27:21,134 --> 01:27:24,940
Now Eddie's done with you,
You hear, DONE!

940
01:27:49,967 --> 01:27:50,993
I saw the well.

941
01:27:51,192 --> 01:27:53,079
W-w-w-we know where IT is

942
01:27:53,277 --> 01:27:55,926
And-and-and next time
we'll be better prepared.

943
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:57,481
NO!

944
01:27:58,077 --> 01:27:59,137
No next time, Bill.

945
01:28:00,626 --> 01:28:02,447
You're insane!

946
01:28:02,546 --> 01:28:05,195
Why? We all know nobody-else
is going to do anything

947
01:28:05,294 --> 01:28:07,677
Eddie was nearly killed and
look at this motherfucker,

948
01:28:07,876 --> 01:28:09,697
he's leaking hamburger helper.

949
01:28:09,796 --> 01:28:10,987
We can't pretend it's going to go away

950
01:28:10,988 --> 01:28:13,802
Ben, you said yourself it
comes back every 27 years.

951
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,847
Fine! I'll be 40 and
far away from here.

952
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:20,123
I thought you said you wanted
to get out of this town too.

953
01:28:20,124 --> 01:28:22,872
Because I want to run
towards something, not away.

954
01:28:23,567 --> 01:28:25,767
I'm sorry but who invited
Molly Ringwald into the group?

955
01:28:26,811 --> 01:28:28,930
- Richie...
- I'm just saying, lets face facts

956
01:28:29,162 --> 01:28:30,162
Real world.

957
01:28:30,254 --> 01:28:32,936
Georgie is dead...
Stop trying to get us killed too.

958
01:28:33,035 --> 01:28:34,127
Georgie's not dead.

959
01:28:35,418 --> 01:28:37,769
You couldn't save him but
you could still save yourself.

960
01:28:38,265 --> 01:28:40,847
No!
T-t-t-take it back,

961
01:28:42,668 --> 01:28:45,846
You're scared and we all are
But take it back.

962
01:28:48,395 --> 01:28:49,488
Bill!

963
01:28:51,308 --> 01:28:53,129
You're such a loser.

964
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:54,652
Richie, stop.

965
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:56,837
You're a bunch of losers,
get us all killed...

966
01:28:56,936 --> 01:28:59,021
- while trying to catch a clown.
- Stop!

967
01:29:01,868 --> 01:29:03,788
This is what IT wants,

968
01:29:03,888 --> 01:29:05,278
IT wants to divide us.

969
01:29:07,959 --> 01:29:10,806
When we're all together,
when we heard it..

970
01:29:11,005 --> 01:29:15,857
Thats why we are still alive.
- Yeah, well I plan to keep it that way.

971
01:29:27,623 --> 01:29:29,543
Mike...
- Guys...

972
01:29:30,735 --> 01:29:32,787
I can't do this.

973
01:29:34,409 --> 01:29:36,098
My granddad was right.

974
01:29:36,296 --> 01:29:39,110
I'm an outsider.
Gotta stay that way.

975
01:30:37,770 --> 01:30:39,558
Yeah, there we go.

976
01:30:39,657 --> 01:30:41,014
Put the next target there.

977
01:30:53,329 --> 01:30:55,017
Just hold it.

978
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,354
What the hell is going on here?

979
01:31:02,002 --> 01:31:05,147
Cleaning your gun,
like you asked.

980
01:31:05,677 --> 01:31:07,795
You're cleaning my gun, huh?

981
01:31:11,602 --> 01:31:13,721
- Dad...
- Hey!

982
01:31:25,241 --> 01:31:26,631
Look at him now, boys.

983
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:31,266
Ain't nothing like a little fear
that'll make a paper man crumble.

984
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:43,334
Here for the refills, Eddie?

985
01:31:43,533 --> 01:31:44,533
Yeah.

986
01:31:52,570 --> 01:31:54,026
You know it's all bullshit, right?

987
01:31:54,225 --> 01:31:55,225
What is?

988
01:31:56,112 --> 01:31:57,138
Your medication.

989
01:31:57,734 --> 01:31:58,992
They're placebos.

990
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:00,290
What's "pa-cee-bo" mean?

991
01:32:00,382 --> 01:32:01,872
Placebo means bullshit.

992
01:32:04,851 --> 01:32:06,176
No friends, huh?

993
01:32:07,069 --> 01:32:08,096
Your cast?

994
01:32:08,493 --> 01:32:10,115
No signatures or anything?

995
01:32:10,611 --> 01:32:11,611
So sad.

996
01:32:12,962 --> 01:32:14,418
I don't want it to get dirty.

997
01:32:15,445 --> 01:32:16,736
Oh, I'll sign it for ya.

998
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:35,505
You okay, Henry?

999
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:48,400
My most favorite part
in the afternoon..

1000
01:33:48,499 --> 01:33:51,413
Is learning all about
so many of you.

1001
01:33:51,611 --> 01:33:53,664
Is there anything
you want to share with us?

1002
01:33:53,697 --> 01:33:55,617
what you feel about today?

1003
01:33:55,716 --> 01:33:56,842
- Me
How about you?

1004
01:33:56,941 --> 01:33:58,199
I like seeing the clown.

1005
01:33:58,298 --> 01:34:00,251
You did? Would you like
to see the clown?

1006
01:34:00,351 --> 01:34:01,244
Yes!

1007
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:03,032
What about IT, anyway?

1008
01:34:03,231 --> 01:34:04,654
I like the bubbles floating.

1009
01:34:04,753 --> 01:34:06,607
You did? Me too.

1010
01:34:06,806 --> 01:34:09,090
I just love seeing things float.

1011
01:34:09,289 --> 01:34:10,381
All float.

1012
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,771
We all float,

1013
01:34:11,871 --> 01:34:14,022
and you will too, Henry.

1014
01:34:14,221 --> 01:34:16,042
Make it a wonderful day.

1015
01:34:16,141 --> 01:34:17,531
Kill him.

1016
01:34:18,326 --> 01:34:20,742
Kill him.

1017
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:25,907
Kill him.

1018
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:30,243
Oh no, give him a big
round of applause.

1019
01:34:37,228 --> 01:34:38,983
Well done, Henry.

1020
01:34:39,016 --> 01:34:42,194
Kill them all.

1021
01:34:43,948 --> 01:34:45,504
Kill them all!

1022
01:34:45,703 --> 01:34:48,550
Kill them all!

1023
01:34:50,966 --> 01:34:52,952
Kill them all!

1024
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,251
Where are you sneaking off to?

1025
01:35:23,342 --> 01:35:24,964
No-nowhere, Daddy.

1026
01:35:26,685 --> 01:35:28,671
You look prettied up.

1027
01:35:29,896 --> 01:35:32,136
I'm not prettied up, daddy.
I wear this almost every day.

1028
01:35:33,273 --> 01:35:34,498
Come here.

1029
01:35:50,189 --> 01:35:52,937
You know I worry about you Bevvie.

1030
01:35:53,334 --> 01:35:54,658
I know.

1031
01:35:55,022 --> 01:35:59,789
People in town have been saying
some things to me about you.

1032
01:36:00,815 --> 01:36:03,927
Sneaking around all summer
along with a bunch of boy.

1033
01:36:04,589 --> 01:36:06,344
Only girl in the pack.

1034
01:36:06,542 --> 01:36:08,959
They're just friends, I swear.

1035
01:36:09,257 --> 01:36:14,951
I know what's in boys minds
when they look at you, Bevvie.

1036
01:36:15,282 --> 01:36:17,367
I know it all too well.

1037
01:36:17,533 --> 01:36:19,320
My hand...

1038
01:36:19,519 --> 01:36:24,948
Are you doing womanly things down
in the woods with those boys?

1039
01:36:25,047 --> 01:36:28,622
No, nothing. You don't
have to worry. I promise.

1040
01:36:29,351 --> 01:36:30,351
What's this?

1041
01:36:31,867 --> 01:36:33,919
It's nothing, it's just a poem.

1042
01:36:35,607 --> 01:36:36,832
Just a poem?

1043
01:36:36,932 --> 01:36:39,216
which you like to hide in
your underwear drawer?

1044
01:36:40,143 --> 01:36:42,857
Why would you have to hide it there?

1045
01:36:45,042 --> 01:36:46,532
Are you still my girl?

1046
01:36:47,028 --> 01:36:48,028
No.

1047
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:49,345
What did you say?

1048
01:36:49,842 --> 01:36:51,663
I said no!

1049
01:36:54,841 --> 01:36:55,867
Go!

1050
01:36:57,423 --> 01:36:59,177
Get away, no!

1051
01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:02,021
Get off!

1052
01:37:02,852 --> 01:37:03,852
No!

1053
01:37:06,758 --> 01:37:10,168
Those boys, do they know that you're...

1054
01:38:35,542 --> 01:38:37,065
Beverly?

1055
01:39:02,092 --> 01:39:03,780
Beverly!

1056
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:14,572
- Richie.
- What do you want?

1057
01:39:15,201 --> 01:39:17,452
You see that guy I'm hitting,
I'm pretending it's you.

1058
01:39:19,076 --> 01:39:20,135
IT got Beverly.

1059
01:39:20,334 --> 01:39:21,824
What are you talking about?

1060
01:39:23,346 --> 01:39:24,803
IT, Richie.

1061
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:26,455
IT got Beverly.

1062
01:39:41,686 --> 01:39:43,010
Hello?

1063
01:39:45,223 --> 01:39:46,514
Okay

1064
01:39:48,136 --> 01:39:49,593
I'll meet you there.

1065
01:39:55,781 --> 01:39:58,061
And just where do you
thing you're off to?

1066
01:39:58,134 --> 01:39:59,161
Out with my friends.

1067
01:40:00,054 --> 01:40:02,471
Sweetie, you can't go

1068
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:04,430
You're getting over
your sickness, remember?

1069
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:06,642
My sickness?

1070
01:40:06,741 --> 01:40:08,595
Okay. 
What- what sickness, Mom?

1071
01:40:11,111 --> 01:40:13,594
Know what these are?
They're "gazebos".

1072
01:40:13,693 --> 01:40:14,786
They're bullshit!

1073
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:23,095
They help you, Eddie.

1074
01:40:24,154 --> 01:40:25,875
I had to protect you.

1075
01:40:25,975 --> 01:40:27,398
Protect me?

1076
01:40:27,497 --> 01:40:30,443
By lying to me? By keeping me
locked inside of this hell-hole?

1077
01:40:30,542 --> 01:40:34,548
I'm sorry but the only people that were actually
trying to protect me are my friends.

1078
01:40:34,647 --> 01:40:36,832
And you made me turn my back
on them when I really needed them.

1079
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:38,031
So I'm going.

1080
01:40:38,123 --> 01:40:41,036
Eddie. Eddie. No.

1081
01:40:41,135 --> 01:40:42,228
You get back here.

1082
01:40:42,427 --> 01:40:44,347
Sorry mommy. I'm gonna see my friends.
- Eddie.

1083
01:40:44,446 --> 01:40:46,233
Don't do this to me, Eddie.

1084
01:41:11,390 --> 01:41:12,549
Guys, spikes.

1085
01:42:03,205 --> 01:42:04,205
Stan?

1086
01:42:06,681 --> 01:42:08,501
Stan, we all have to go.

1087
01:42:08,733 --> 01:42:10,918
Beverly was right.

1088
01:42:11,812 --> 01:42:15,486
If we split up like last time,
that clown will kill us, one by one,

1089
01:42:16,512 --> 01:42:19,293
But if we s-s-stick together,

1090
01:42:20,816 --> 01:42:22,173
All of us...

1091
01:42:23,895 --> 01:42:25,384
We'll win.

1092
01:42:26,146 --> 01:42:27,271
I promise.

1093
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:56,601
Eddie, you got a quarter?

1094
01:42:58,058 --> 01:43:00,441
I wouldn't want to make a
wish in that fucking thing.

1095
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:07,095
Beverly?

1096
01:43:07,161 --> 01:43:08,681
How are we supposed
to get down there?

1097
01:43:10,505 --> 01:43:12,061
Alright, go on.

1098
01:43:28,977 --> 01:43:30,268
Alright.

1099
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:12,492
Guys-guys-guys, help?

1100
01:45:14,710 --> 01:45:16,134
Alright, buddy?
- Yeah yeah.

1101
01:45:21,318 --> 01:45:24,496
Step right up, Beverly.
Step right up.

1102
01:45:25,622 --> 01:45:27,629
Come change, come cold,

1103
01:45:27,728 --> 01:45:31,204
You'll laugh, you'll cry,
you'll cheer, you'll die.

1104
01:45:32,098 --> 01:45:35,938
Introducing Pennywise
the dancing clown.

1105
01:46:12,826 --> 01:46:14,382
I'm not afraid of you.

1106
01:46:21,433 --> 01:46:22,857
You will be...

1107
01:46:35,668 --> 01:46:38,118
Help me!

1108
01:46:49,307 --> 01:46:50,962
Ahhh!

1109
01:46:54,007 --> 01:46:54,901
Mike!

1110
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,490
- Mike!
- Mike!

1111
01:46:57,185 --> 01:46:58,907
You okay? Mike!

1112
01:46:59,403 --> 01:47:00,430
Bowers.

1113
01:47:01,092 --> 01:47:02,416
Mike! Fuck.

1114
01:47:03,144 --> 01:47:04,932
Mike!
Where is he?

1115
01:47:06,606 --> 01:47:07,831
We're next.

1116
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:09,651
No-No-No-No-No-No!

1117
01:47:09,751 --> 01:47:11,009
Grab it! Get the rope!
Get the rope!

1118
01:47:11,704 --> 01:47:12,730
Shit.

1119
01:47:14,253 --> 01:47:15,511
Mike!

1120
01:47:16,438 --> 01:47:17,960
Leave him alone!

1121
01:47:19,649 --> 01:47:21,734
You didn't listen to
what I told ya did ya?

1122
01:47:23,091 --> 01:47:25,640
You should've stayed out of Derry.

1123
01:47:25,972 --> 01:47:28,818
Your parents didn't..
and look what happened to them.

1124
01:47:29,878 --> 01:47:32,460
I still get sad every time
I pass that pile of ashes,

1125
01:47:32,824 --> 01:47:34,148
Sad.

1126
01:47:35,207 --> 01:47:36,647
that I couldn't have done it myself.

1127
01:47:37,558 --> 01:47:39,147
Run Mike!

1128
01:47:45,635 --> 01:47:46,827
Mike!

1129
01:47:48,118 --> 01:47:49,277
Fucked out!

1130
01:47:52,157 --> 01:47:54,209
I sh-sh-sh-should get up there.

1131
01:47:54,606 --> 01:47:56,559
Are you insane? With what?

1132
01:48:25,062 --> 01:48:26,485
Holy shit!

1133
01:48:28,670 --> 01:48:30,358
Mike!

1134
01:48:31,054 --> 01:48:32,345
I'm okay.

1135
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:34,099
I'm okay.

1136
01:48:38,105 --> 01:48:39,296
Shit.

1137
01:48:40,753 --> 01:48:42,408
Stanley.

1138
01:48:43,368 --> 01:48:44,692
Beverly.

1139
01:48:47,639 --> 01:48:48,996
Is that you?

1140
01:48:57,801 --> 01:48:58,801
Guys?

1141
01:49:02,237 --> 01:49:03,462
Guys?

1142
01:49:07,898 --> 01:49:09,951
Guys, where's Stan?

1143
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:11,050
Stanley!

1144
01:49:11,242 --> 01:49:12,764
Stanley!

1145
01:49:12,864 --> 01:49:13,864
Stan!

1146
01:49:15,413 --> 01:49:16,935
Oh shit, gray water.

1147
01:49:19,915 --> 01:49:20,915
Stan?

1148
01:49:21,835 --> 01:49:22,960
Stan?

1149
01:49:24,152 --> 01:49:25,152
Stanley!

1150
01:49:50,105 --> 01:49:51,661
Stan! Stanley!

1151
01:49:52,721 --> 01:49:53,747
Stanley!

1152
01:49:54,541 --> 01:49:56,296
We're coming, man!
Here we go.

1153
01:49:59,639 --> 01:50:02,023
- Stan?
- Stanley! Stan!

1154
01:50:02,122 --> 01:50:03,181
Your flashlight!

1155
01:50:06,655 --> 01:50:08,608
What the fuck is that thing?

1156
01:50:09,206 --> 01:50:10,206
Oh shit!

1157
01:50:16,456 --> 01:50:17,515
Oh shh-

1158
01:50:24,864 --> 01:50:25,891
Shit!

1159
01:50:26,884 --> 01:50:27,910
Holy shit!

1160
01:50:29,102 --> 01:50:29,962
Stanley!

1161
01:50:30,062 --> 01:50:30,656
Stanley!

1162
01:50:30,686 --> 01:50:31,949
- Stan!
- Stanley.

1163
01:50:32,147 --> 01:50:35,361
No!

1164
01:50:35,391 --> 01:50:36,391
Stanley, No!

1165
01:50:36,583 --> 01:50:38,133
You left me!

1166
01:50:39,563 --> 01:50:40,820
You're not my friends.

1167
01:50:40,986 --> 01:50:42,873
You made me go in the Neibolt!

1168
01:50:42,972 --> 01:50:44,065
I'm sorry.

1169
01:50:44,197 --> 01:50:45,753
You made me go in the Neibolt.

1170
01:50:47,838 --> 01:50:49,295
This is your fault.

1171
01:50:52,208 --> 01:50:55,353
We would never let
anything happen.

1172
01:50:55,452 --> 01:50:58,763
You know-you know I wouldn't
do that to you. Come on.

1173
01:50:58,862 --> 01:51:00,848
Bill!

1174
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:04,390
Bill!

1175
01:51:36,336 --> 01:51:37,494
Beverly!

1176
01:52:04,077 --> 01:52:05,732
I'll come back for you, Bev.

1177
01:52:13,412 --> 01:52:14,604
Bill?

1178
01:52:17,616 --> 01:52:18,675
Bill.

1179
01:52:21,555 --> 01:52:22,582
Bill.

1180
01:52:23,906 --> 01:52:25,925
Woah, get out of there dud,
It's gray water.

1181
01:52:26,124 --> 01:52:28,176
W-w-w-wait, where's my
fucking flashlight?

1182
01:52:28,904 --> 01:52:29,964
Eddie!

1183
01:52:34,532 --> 01:52:36,882
Let's get fucking outta here.
Come on!

1184
01:52:54,295 --> 01:52:55,983
Bev? Bev?

1185
01:52:57,043 --> 01:52:58,565
Bev?
Oh shit.

1186
01:52:59,393 --> 01:53:00,419
Bev.

1187
01:53:06,510 --> 01:53:08,232
How is she in the air?

1188
01:53:10,383 --> 01:53:11,774
Guys.

1189
01:53:13,297 --> 01:53:14,323
Are those...?

1190
01:53:15,217 --> 01:53:16,541
The missing kids.

1191
01:53:16,967 --> 01:53:18,026
Floating.

1192
01:53:20,281 --> 01:53:22,135
Just let me grab her.

1193
01:53:27,763 --> 01:53:29,087
I'm slipping.

1194
01:53:37,462 --> 01:53:38,462
Bev!

1195
01:53:39,879 --> 01:53:41,137
Beverly.

1196
01:53:41,236 --> 01:53:43,024
Why isn't she waking up?

1197
01:53:43,222 --> 01:53:44,977
What  is wrong with her?

1198
01:53:45,076 --> 01:53:47,061
Beverly! Please!

1199
01:53:56,903 --> 01:53:57,995
Woah-woah-woah...

1200
01:54:06,930 --> 01:54:08,121
Bev?

1201
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:13,512
"January embers?"

1202
01:54:14,009 --> 01:54:16,227
"My heart burns there too."

1203
01:54:18,312 --> 01:54:20,100
Jesus! Fuck..

1204
01:54:21,524 --> 01:54:23,046
Oh god.

1205
01:54:32,183 --> 01:54:33,606
Where is Bill?

1206
01:54:38,042 --> 01:54:39,433
Georgie.

1207
01:54:43,457 --> 01:54:44,781
What took you so long?

1208
01:54:49,085 --> 01:54:51,998
I was looking for you this whole time.

1209
01:54:53,355 --> 01:54:56,268
I couldn't find my way outta here.

1210
01:54:59,082 --> 01:55:01,598
He said l could have
my boat back, Billy.

1211
01:55:06,659 --> 01:55:07,950
Was she fast?

1212
01:55:08,678 --> 01:55:10,962
I couldn't keep up with it.

1213
01:55:13,180 --> 01:55:14,339
"she" Georgie.

1214
01:55:17,517 --> 01:55:19,040
You call boats "she".

1215
01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:23,707
Take me home, Billy.

1216
01:55:30,957 --> 01:55:32,612
I wanna go home.

1217
01:55:36,287 --> 01:55:39,994
I miss you, I wanna be
with mom and dad.

1218
01:55:41,947 --> 01:55:45,456
I want more than anything
for you to be home,

1219
01:55:47,807 --> 01:55:50,687
With Mom and Dad.

1220
01:55:52,772 --> 01:55:55,321
I miss you so much.

1221
01:56:00,121 --> 01:56:01,843
I love you, Billy.

1222
01:56:03,498 --> 01:56:04,756
I love you too,

1223
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:15,382
But you're not Georgie.

1224
01:57:02,231 --> 01:57:03,431
Kill IT NOW, Billy!
Kill IT!

1225
01:57:03,522 --> 01:57:04,581
Shit!

1226
01:57:04,780 --> 01:57:06,468
Kill IT Bill.

1227
01:57:07,362 --> 01:57:08,587
Kill IT Bill.

1228
01:57:09,348 --> 01:57:10,441
Kill IT!

1229
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:11,765
Kill IT!

1230
01:57:11,964 --> 01:57:12,964
Kill IT!

1231
01:57:13,255 --> 01:57:14,314
It's not loaded.

1232
01:57:14,413 --> 01:57:16,764
Do it, Bill! Kill IT!

1233
01:57:18,121 --> 01:57:19,677
Hey, it's not loaded!

1234
01:57:22,689 --> 01:57:24,046
Dammit.

1235
01:57:25,437 --> 01:57:26,463
Fuck.

1236
01:57:34,011 --> 01:57:35,037
Bill, watch out!

1237
01:57:38,678 --> 01:57:39,705
Leave him alone!

1238
01:57:41,956 --> 01:57:42,717
Beverly, no!

1239
01:57:42,849 --> 01:57:43,849
Mike!

1240
01:57:49,404 --> 01:57:50,404
Help him!

1241
01:57:51,324 --> 01:57:52,324
Fuck.

1242
01:57:54,138 --> 01:57:55,164
Ben!

1243
01:58:00,626 --> 01:58:01,626
Stanley!

1244
01:58:08,174 --> 01:58:09,465
Bill!

1245
01:58:10,657 --> 01:58:11,749
Bill!

1246
01:58:12,510 --> 01:58:13,835
No. Don't!

1247
01:58:14,596 --> 01:58:15,596
Let him go.

1248
01:58:15,986 --> 01:58:16,986
No.

1249
01:58:17,079 --> 01:58:18,966
I'll take him.

1250
01:58:19,197 --> 01:58:21,151
I'll take all of you.

1251
01:58:21,846 --> 01:58:26,149
And I'll feast on your flesh
as I feed on your fear...

1252
01:58:29,658 --> 01:58:31,313
Oooooorrrrr

1253
01:58:33,002 --> 01:58:35,319
You just leave us be

1254
01:58:35,418 --> 01:58:38,464
I'm taking him, only him.

1255
01:58:39,126 --> 01:58:41,245
Then I will have my long rest

1256
01:58:41,443 --> 01:58:45,714
And you will all live to grow old..

1257
01:58:45,978 --> 01:58:49,256
and drive and lead happy lives

1258
01:58:50,116 --> 01:58:53,592
until old age takes you
back to the weeds.

1259
01:58:57,465 --> 01:58:58,657
Leave...

1260
01:59:00,974 --> 01:59:03,093
I'm the one who dragged
you all into this

1261
01:59:04,517 --> 01:59:06,039
I'm s-s-s-s-, I'm s-s-sorry.

1262
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:07,264
S-s-s-s-sorry.
Hahaha

1263
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:13,145
Go!

1264
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:17,150
Guys, we can't.

1265
01:59:19,037 --> 01:59:20,792
Sorry, Bill.

1266
01:59:23,341 --> 01:59:24,797
I told you, Bill.

1267
01:59:25,294 --> 01:59:26,453
I fucking told you,

1268
01:59:27,446 --> 01:59:29,531
I don't want to die...

1269
01:59:30,260 --> 01:59:31,451
It's your fault.

1270
01:59:33,934 --> 01:59:35,788
You punched me in the face.

1271
01:59:35,987 --> 01:59:37,609
You made me walk through shitty water.

1272
01:59:37,708 --> 01:59:39,468
You brought me to a
fucking crackhead-house.

1273
01:59:40,753 --> 01:59:42,144
And now...

1274
01:59:45,752 --> 01:59:47,507
I'm gonna have to kill
this fucking clown!

1275
01:59:48,334 --> 01:59:49,956
Welcome to the losers club, asshole!

1276
01:59:57,570 --> 01:59:59,060
Mike - Mike

1277
02:00:04,886 --> 02:00:06,078
Stan, look out!

1278
02:00:08,825 --> 02:00:09,825
Mike!

1279
02:00:19,352 --> 02:00:20,412
Kill him

1280
02:00:48,815 --> 02:00:50,636
I'm gonna kill you.

1281
02:00:56,197 --> 02:00:59,044
Hey Bevvie, are you
still my little girl?

1282
02:01:08,611 --> 02:01:09,611
Oh shit!

1283
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:31,585
That's why you didn't kill Beverly,

1284
02:01:32,909 --> 02:01:36,054
Cause s-s-s-s-she wasn't afraid

1285
02:01:37,047 --> 02:01:38,537
and we aren't either

1286
02:01:39,464 --> 02:01:40,887
Not anymore.

1287
02:01:43,271 --> 02:01:45,422
Now you're the one that's afraid,

1288
02:01:47,111 --> 02:01:48,600
Because you're gonna starve.

1289
02:01:55,784 --> 02:01:58,399
"He thrusts his hands
against the post...

1290
02:01:58,498 --> 02:02:01,908
"and still insists he sees the ghost.

1291
02:02:02,107 --> 02:02:05,218
"He thrusts his hands
against the p-p-p-p-post."

1292
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,092
Fear.

1293
02:02:38,009 --> 02:02:40,757
I know what I'm doing for
my summer experience essay.

1294
02:02:53,535 --> 02:02:55,621
Guys. Guys.

1295
02:02:57,177 --> 02:02:59,395
The kids are floating down.

1296
02:04:09,144 --> 02:04:12,190
September.

1297
02:04:17,884 --> 02:04:20,333
I can only remember parts,
But...

1298
02:04:21,124 --> 02:04:22,813
I thought I was dead.

1299
02:04:23,970 --> 02:04:25,691
That's what it felt like.

1300
02:04:26,883 --> 02:04:30,160
I saw us, saw us together,
back in the cistern,

1301
02:04:30,359 --> 02:04:31,915
But we were older...

1302
02:04:32,908 --> 02:04:34,960
Like our parents ages.

1303
02:04:35,954 --> 02:04:39,330
W-w-w-what are we doing there?

1304
02:04:39,827 --> 02:04:41,813
I just remembered how we felt

1305
02:04:43,567 --> 02:04:45,289
How scared were we

1306
02:04:45,421 --> 02:04:47,738
I don't think I can ever forget that.

1307
02:04:53,167 --> 02:04:54,194
Swear.

1308
02:04:55,154 --> 02:04:56,478
Swear.

1309
02:04:57,074 --> 02:04:58,994
If IT isn't dead

1310
02:04:59,689 --> 02:05:03,099
If IT ever comes back,
we'll come back too.

1311
02:06:28,011 --> 02:06:29,070
I gotta go...

1312
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:32,976
I hate you.

1313
02:06:43,271 --> 02:06:44,993
I'll see you later.

1314
02:06:45,390 --> 02:06:46,390
Goodbye, Stan.

1315
02:06:52,011 --> 02:06:53,037
Good bye guys.

1316
02:06:53,269 --> 02:06:54,269
Goodbye, Mike.

1317
02:06:54,361 --> 02:06:55,361
See you later, loser.

1318
02:06:57,440 --> 02:06:58,598
See you, Bill.

1319
02:06:58,698 --> 02:06:59,698
See you, Rich.

1320
02:06:59,790 --> 02:07:00,982
See you guys later.

02:07:02,571 --> 02:07:04,061
Goodbye, Ben.

1322
02:07:08,713 --> 02:07:11,527
Y-y-y-you all packed for Portland?

1323
02:07:12,553 --> 02:07:14,804
Yeah, pretty much.

1324
02:07:15,102 --> 02:07:16,492
I'm going tomorrow morning.

1325
02:07:16,658 --> 02:07:18,346
How long you'll be gone?

1326
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:24,139
My aunt she says I can stay
for as long as I want. So..

1327
02:07:27,350 --> 02:07:28,741
Just say, you know..

1328
02:07:30,859 --> 02:07:33,044
I never felt like a loser
when I was with all of you.

1329
02:07:43,439 --> 02:07:44,862
See you around.

1330
02:08:32,532 --> 02:08:33,558
Bye.
