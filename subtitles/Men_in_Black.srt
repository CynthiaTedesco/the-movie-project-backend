Going to get your gun back, huh?
I like this gun.

1232
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:44,203
Yeah, well, while you was
in there playing around,

1233
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:46,164
I was down here
doing all the work.

1234
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:49,375
You know, first I had to bean him
in the head with this big rock.

1235
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,461
Then I was gonna hit him
with this 2-by-4.

1236
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:53,296
He kicked me,
and, you know, it hurt.

1237
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:56,462
But then I got to the fire, you know.
I was like "ah" with the fire.

1238
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:59,222
Not bad for your
second day of work, is it?

01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:03,143
Well, this definitely rates about
a 9.0 on my weird-shit-o-meter.

You should've been
here for the Zeronian

Whoa.

these rules and everything,

1246
01:27:39,129 --> 01:27:41,552
but I was thinking,
she did help us bust that bug.

1247
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:44,719
Maybe we didn't
have to flashy-thing her.

What, who's she gonna tell?

She hang out

them anymore, but they

I haven't been training a partner.
I've been training a replacement.

Wait a minute, Kay.
I cannot do this job by myself.

All right, let's put in
a call to Dennis Rodman.
He's from that planet.

1273
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:09,492
Rodman? You're kidding.
Nope.
