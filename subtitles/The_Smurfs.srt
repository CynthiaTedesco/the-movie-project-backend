1
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:51,762
There is a place.

2
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:55,182
A place that knows no sadness.

3
00:00:55,807 --> 00:01:00,145
Where even feeling blue is a happy thing.

4
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:07,361
A place inhabited by little blue beings
three apples high.

5
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:13,700
It lies deep in an enchanted forest,
hidden away beyond a medieval village.

6
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:16,870
Most people believe this place is made up,

7
00:01:16,954 --> 00:01:21,541
only to be found in books
or in children's imaginations.

8
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:24,544
Well, we beg to differ.

9
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:28,257
Yeah! Come on, Farmer!

10
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,512
I'm going in!

11
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:38,100
All right, Greedy, I'm gonna race you!

12
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:39,726
Yes!

13
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:47,776
Whoa, golly! Farm boys love to fly!

14
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:51,363
Oh, yeah! So excited!

15
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:02,541
Now you see us, now you don't!

16
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,961
Three, two, one. Yeah!

17
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:24,688
Yeah! I love smurf berries! Hey, hey!
The blue ones are mine!

18
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:39,202
Oh, no! I'm late for rehearsal!
I am so late!

19
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:44,374
In Smurf village, each and every Smurf
plays their own special part.

20
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,918
- Whoa, Nellie!
- Sorry, Handy!

21
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:50,130
No problem, Clumsy. You keep me employed!

22
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:52,591
Which gives the Smurfs a sense of harmony.

23
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:54,968
- Hey, Baker! Nice pies!
- No worries, Clumsy.

24
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:57,512
- And tranquility.
- Great sign, guys!

25
00:02:57,596 --> 00:03:00,098
- Whether it's Handy Smurf, the builder.
- I can't stay. Rehearsal time!

26
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:02,601
- Baker Smurf.
- Hey, Narrator Smurf!

27
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:06,605
Hello, Clumsy! Just rehearsing the intro
for the Blue Moon Festival!

28
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:09,191
- Pizza!
- Pardon me! Pardon me! Hey, Chef Smurf!

29
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:11,943
Clumsy! Help!

30
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:17,324
I just invented frozen pizzas! Genius!

31
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:19,659
Smurf on the loose!

32
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:21,036
- Hey, Clumsy.
- Hey, guys!

33
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,746
- Hi, Jokey!
- Hi, Clumsy.

34
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:25,582
Who's clumsy now, huh?

35
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:28,627
Hey, what do you get when you cross
a Smurf with a cow?

36
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:32,547
Blue cheese! I got you a present.

37
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:34,966
No, thanks, Jokey. I'm late for rehearsal!

38
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,968
But, wait! I...

39
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:42,641
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.

40
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:44,643
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your roll, sailor.

41
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:47,312
Hey, wait, wait. Isn't that the rehearsal
for the Blue Moon Festival?

42
00:03:47,396 --> 00:03:49,815
What can I say, Clumsy?
You're not on the list.

43
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,650
Grouchy, it's right there.

44
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:55,320
Right. Under "Do not let in Clumsy."

45
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:57,823
Clearly you two
lack the verbal skills required

46
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,950
- to explain this predicament succinctly.
- Hey!

47
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:01,660
- Here we go.
- You see, Clumsy,

48
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:05,414
the other Smurfs don't want to dance with
you for fear of what are politely called

49
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:07,416
"fractures."

50
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,169
How could anybody think that?

51
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:13,630
That's gonna leave a big blue bruise.

52
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:20,137
Wonderful! Beautiful! Marvelous.

53
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:22,973
Watch it, there!

54
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:28,812
Cut! Cut! Cut! It's a dance, not dominoes.

55
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:33,024
- A worry line!
- All right, don't get your petals in a twist.

56
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:36,945
As happy and as perfect
as life in Smurf village is,

57
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:42,033
even sunshine and butterflies
must have their dark clouds.

58
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:46,621
And for all Smurfs,
that dark cloud has one name.

59
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:49,875
Gargamel, the evil wizard.

60
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:54,129
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

61
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:58,467
La la la la la la
This is so wrong

62
00:04:58,717 --> 00:05:00,552
"I'm Papa Smurf.

63
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:03,305
"I'm the head of a small
group of blue people

64
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:07,726
"and live in the forest
with 99 sons and one daughter.

65
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:12,063
"Nothing weird about that, no, no.
Totally normal."

66
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:15,734
"Oh, and I'm Smurfette.
And I think I'm so pretty.

67
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:18,653
"And I betrayed Gargamel,
and I don't even care.

68
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:21,490
"And everything is just
sunshine and rainbows."

69
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:28,371
But all of that is about to change.

70
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:39,090
I said, "All of that is about to change."
Azrael, that's your cue!

71
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:41,343
That's your cue to
pounce on the miserable beasts

72
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:44,429
in some kind of a
rage-induced feline frenzy.

73
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:46,014
Yes, good. Yeah. More rage.

74
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:48,892
Hey, but don't go crazy.
These are the only puppets I have.

75
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:53,522
I am not obsessed with Smurfs, thank you.

76
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:56,358
I simply can't stop thinking about
the miserable beasts

77
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:58,735
every single minute of every single day.

78
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:00,946
'Cause I need them!

79
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:05,200
It is only by capturing the little wretches
and extracting their happy blue essence

80
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:08,870
that my magic will finally become...

81
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,248
Not infallible.

82
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:15,126
Invincible! Yes. Thank you.

83
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,965
I shall become the most powerful wizard
in all of the world.

84
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:32,060
Yeah, but you're milking it. Don't milk it.

85
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,395
"O great one?"

86
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:36,648
Yes, lying, deceptive,
horrible little Smurfette?

87
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:41,278
"After all your years of Smurf-less searching,
how ever do you expect to find us?"

88
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:44,072
I'm very glad you asked, my dear.

89
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:46,741
For, you see, I have a magical map

90
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:49,494
that shows me exactly where
the smurf root grows!

91
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:54,332
I shall now use my formidable powers
to magically transport us here!

92
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:58,295
Come, my little fish-breathed friend!

93
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:00,088
Alakazoop!

94
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:04,509
Great.

95
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,680
Ye gods, Azrael. You're a boy?

96
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:12,601
We really need that Smurf essence.

97
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:14,019
Alakazamp!

98
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:19,691
Now tie it off right there!

99
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:23,361
That blue moon time of year again.

100
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:25,864
Time to smurf some magic.

101
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:29,618
Summon a vision
and see what our future holds.

102
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:32,954
I must get the visioning potion just right.

103
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:35,999
The magic is always strongest
during the blue moon.

104
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:41,129
So far, so good.
Lots of smiles and smurf berries.

105
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:44,549
Clumsy's sitting still. That's always good.

106
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,219
A dragon wand.

107
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,556
I got it! I got it!

108
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:53,683
Clumsy.

109
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:59,564
- Help! Save us!
- Papa!

110
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,736
Papa!

111
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:08,490
Clumsy, what have you done?

112
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:11,534
- Hey, Papa.
- Clumsy?

113
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,203
Are you okay?

114
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:16,331
Yes. Fine.

115
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:18,917
Why aren't you rehearsing for
the Blue Moon celebration?

116
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,920
You know.
A couple guys got smacked in the face,

117
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:24,339
so I thought I'd make
some smurf root mud packs

118
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:27,592
to take down everyone's swelling.

119
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:31,596
Papa, you're smurf out of smurf root.
I'll go pick some.

120
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,433
No! Those fields are too close
to Gargamel's castle.

121
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:36,935
I'll get the smurf root.

122
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:40,188
You stay in the village and out of trouble.
Do you understand?

123
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:43,900
Okay. If you say so.

124
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:49,906
A vision's never been wrong.
I can't let this happen to my Smurfs.

125
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:54,953
"Just stay in the village, Clumsy."

126
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:59,457
Look at all this smurf root.
They are gonna be so proud of me.

127
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,585
Let's see, just a few more...

128
00:09:06,256 --> 00:09:07,966
- Boo.
- Gargamel!

129
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:12,595
Help!

130
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:15,432
Good kitty. Good kitty. Look! Look!

131
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,975
A ball of yarn!

132
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:19,060
A nice, juicy bird!

133
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:24,607
So, that's it!

134
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:27,944
It's invisible.

135
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:31,156
Those sneaky... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

136
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:34,325
We don't know if it's safe.

137
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:41,124
Azrael?

138
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,128
Are you dead?

139
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:49,340
So, what did you see in your vision, Papa?

140
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:53,261
Nothing apocalyptic, really.

141
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:55,013
Everything's going to be just fine.

142
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:58,767
Perfect. Another year we don't have to
worry about that mean, old...

143
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,644
- Gargamel!
- I know who she meant, Clumsy.

144
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:04,981
No, no! Gargamel!

145
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:08,193
I mighta, kinda, sorta
accidentally led him to the village.

146
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,196
Gargamel!

147
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:14,115
Smurf for your lives!

148
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:16,159
Everybody skedaddle!

149
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,622
- Into the forest, Smurfs!
- Come on, Clumsy!

150
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:22,957
Sound the alarm, Crazy.

151
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,043
This is really bad!

152
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:26,461
Smurfs, that way!

153
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:29,547
Hey, cat! Azrael, over here! Come on!

154
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:33,718
There you go, you nasty cat.

155
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:35,970
- This way!
- This is no joke!

156
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:37,722
- Look out!
- Papa!

157
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,737
Let go! Cursed nature!

158
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:00,745
Here comes papa, Papa!

159
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:09,254
Papa, your primitive little defenses,
they're useless against me, sir!

160
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:11,631
I laugh at them.

161
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,601
How's that for primitive, Gargamel?

162
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:25,520
Maybe this will all blow over.

163
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:28,064
I can fix this. I just gotta think.

164
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:29,315
Yes!

165
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:30,984
Follow me, everyone!

166
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:35,238
Save yourselves!

167
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:38,116
Clumsy! You're going the wrong way!

168
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:40,702
- He's headed for the Forbidden Falls!
- With the blue moon coming?

169
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:43,454
- Quickly, Smurfs! Stop him!
- Unbelievable!

170
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,624
The one time we want him to trip
and he's running perfectly!

171
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:48,084
- Clumsy!
- Oh, this is a predicament.

172
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:51,254
"Agony ahead"!
Anybody reading these signs?

173
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:53,965
- This is a predicament!
- This guy's killing me!

174
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,383
Looks like we're down to 99 Smurfs!

175
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,010
This is not good at all.

176
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,600
Clumsy!

177
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,519
Help!

178
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:08,021
Well, we tried. Let's go.

179
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:11,065
Hold on, lad!
We'll form a Smurf bridge to get you.

180
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:12,650
Not the Smurf bridge!

181
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:15,194
- There we go.
- Yeah, pardon me.

182
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,947
This is not a Smurf bridge,
it's clearly a chain...

183
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:19,949
- Smurf it, Brainy!
- Smurf it, Brainy!

184
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:22,410
- The blue moon!
- Oh, dear.

185
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:25,163
- What's happening, Papa?
- What the blinking flip is that?

186
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:26,497
Oh, no!

187
00:12:26,623 --> 00:12:29,042
- The vision!
- Come on, guys!

188
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:31,210
- Pull him up!
- Hurry!

189
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:36,007
- Don't let go!
- Help!

190
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:37,467
Help!

191
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:39,427
Look out for the hole!

192
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,305
No, it's more of a vortex. Or a portal.

193
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:44,182
Smurf up! It's a hole.

194
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:48,561
Hold on!

195
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,105
Oh, no!

196
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:54,859
Looks like you got
the short end of the stick, eh, Papa?

197
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:58,029
Now you belong to me!

198
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,865
Not this time, Gargamel!

199
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,804
What's wrong with you?

200
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:26,933
That was great! Let's have another go.

201
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:29,811
Are you smurf ed? We almost died in there!

202
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:31,187
We're not even wet.

203
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,107
What part of the enchanted forest is this?

204
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:36,109
My calculations indicate...

205
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:38,236
That's slimy.

206
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:41,531
I don't think we're in
Smurf village anymore.

207
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:42,949
Oh, my.

208
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:48,788
- Smurfs? You may want to take a look at this.
- What is it?

209
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:52,917
Why are we listening to him?
He just got us sucked through a giant hole.

210
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,377
It's not a hole, it's a vortex.

211
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,588
And can't we just go around the rock?

212
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:05,430
Oh, my smurf.

213
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:07,348
Where the smurf are we?

214
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:11,477
Up the smurfing creek without a paddle,
that's where.

215
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,479
Well, at least they're not coming after us.

216
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:15,982
Oh, yeah. Really?

217
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,901
- Oh, dear.
- Azrael!

218
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:20,278
- Run!
- Not again!

219
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:24,407
Azrael? Are you dead?

220
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:33,666
Must have Smurfs!

221
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:40,298
- We'll circle back when it's safe!
- Run!

222
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:42,091
- Guys, come on!
- Go!

223
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,052
- Coming through!
- I'm getting hungry!

224
00:14:44,135 --> 00:14:46,637
Hey, how are you? Yeah, nice to see you.
Enjoy the party.

225
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:48,431
Hey, can we get
the photographer over there?

226
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:51,642
There's big arrivals happening.
Thanks. Welcome.

227
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:55,646
Hey, ladies, looking good.
A couple quick, quick tips.

228
00:14:55,772 --> 00:14:57,690
If you could not stand
directly in front of the display,

229
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:01,110
but over to the sides, it'd be a bit
more visible. Hey, look, product.

230
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:02,320
Also, don't forget to smile.

231
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,615
Remember, you're working for
a cosmetics company. That's it.

232
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:07,784
- Smile, relax, everyone will have a good time.
- Let's go!

233
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:10,536
- Thanks. Thank you so much.
- Hurry!

234
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,121
Hello, Henri.

235
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:13,956
On top of everything
with the campaign, Patrick?

236
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,166
Well, as much as I can be.

237
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,710
We certainly did our homework.
We tested the results.

238
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,337
Patrick!

239
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,801
- She's pointing at me.
- That can't be good.

240
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,180
Odile, it looks fantastic for
Thursday's launch.

241
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:31,224
It's gonna be quite the gala.

242
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:36,020
There he is.
My new vice president of marketing.

243
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:38,731
- So, wait, you fired Ralph?
- His campaign was rubbish.

244
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,151
He gave me what I asked
for, not what I want.

245
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,403
Can you give me what I want?

246
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:45,988
Is that what you're asking for?

247
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:49,325
How would I know what I'm asking for
when I don't even know what I want?

248
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:52,453
Well said, Odile. Well said.
That's why you need me.

249
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:56,207
Exacto! I need you to create
a new campaign for Jouvenel.

250
00:15:56,332 --> 00:16:00,044
All digital, of course,
so it can be ready on time for the launch.

251
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:02,880
Odile, that's two days.

252
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:06,551
Si, mi corazón, and it mustn't be delayed.
Is that going to be a problem?

253
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:09,303
No. No, I mean for a whole new campaign,
it's kind of tight.

254
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:11,264
But... No, two days is perfect.

255
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:13,057
God only needed six days
for the whole world, right?

256
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:16,561
Fail me, and maybe you can
go and work for him.

257
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:24,610
Where are we, Azrael?

258
00:16:27,238 --> 00:16:30,449
What manner of freakish realm is this?

259
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:35,913
Okay, one more box of research.
Hey, would you get a cab for me, please?

260
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,748
Yes, yes, of course.

261
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:39,750
This day just keeps getting
better and better.

262
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:42,795
So we're just gonna jump in the portal,
get back to our village

263
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,213
and everybody's happy, right?

264
00:16:44,297 --> 00:16:46,507
Yeah, guys. Let's stay smurftimistic.

265
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,843
You know what?
I choose to be pessismurfstic.

266
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:50,178
We're all gonna die.

267
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:53,639
Papa Smurf, how do we get home
with the portal closed?

268
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:56,350
I'm sure when the blue moon rises tonight,

269
00:16:56,434 --> 00:16:58,227
the portal will open again.

270
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:00,229
Now, let's take shelter till dark.

271
00:17:00,438 --> 00:17:02,064
All right, let's get smurfing.

272
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:04,233
Okay, but I'm not happy.

273
00:17:04,984 --> 00:17:06,277
- Azrael!
- Run, Smurfs!

274
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:07,653
- Take that!
- Guys, come on!

275
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,239
- Quick, to the tree!
- Let's go!

276
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:15,244
- Smurfette!
- My hair! Get back, cat!

277
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,415
Way to go, Smurfette!

278
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,252
- Oh, no!
- Take one for the team, Clumsy!

279
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:24,795
- Help!
- Clumsy, look out!

280
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:26,297
Smurf!

281
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:30,468
- Clumsy!
- Oh, no!

282
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,595
Hey.

283
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:35,306
- Clumsy!
- What a numptie.

284
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,975
- Quickly, to the mechanical wagon.
- Up the tree, Smurfs.

285
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,977
Why don't we just go around the tree?

286
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:42,980
There you are. By all means,

287
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:46,692
relax here in the fresh air and the sunshine
while my missing Smurfs could be anywhere.

288
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,487
What? Where?

289
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:51,113
Come on! Try and stay with me, Smurfs.

290
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:53,491
- I'm getting too old for this.
- Slow down!

291
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,034
Be careful, Brainy.

292
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,078
Hey. Hey!

293
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:59,163
Seventh Street, from First and A, please.

294
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:00,915
- Come on, Smurfs!
- I don't like these heights.

295
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,292
- Don't look down.
- Come back here, wretched Smurfs!

296
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:04,710
- Hurry!
- We're way up here!

297
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,546
A jump from this height
will knock the blue out of us!

298
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:09,048
- My hip.
- Papa!

299
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,341
- Gargamel!
- Oh, dear.

300
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:11,842
- Stop that carriage!
- Let's go! Let's go!

301
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:13,970
- Wait, wait. I forgot my phone.
- Come back! Stop there!

302
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:16,514
Stop that carriage!

303
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,015
Never mind. Here it is.

304
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:20,142
Knock yourself out, Gargamel!

305
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,395
You've had that coming for about 30 years!

306
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,729
Smurfs!

307
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,657
Oh, wow.

308
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:42,331
Castles and palaces everywhere!

309
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:45,418
- And green goblins!
- And red trolls.

310
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:48,671
And look at the giant princess!

311
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:53,592
This village is amazing, Papa.

312
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:56,429
Yes, and likely very dangerous.

313
00:18:56,554 --> 00:18:58,848
Until we rescue Clumsy and get back home,

314
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:02,768
I need you all to stay close
and do exactly as I say.

315
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,895
- Smurf's honor.
- If you say so.

316
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:06,105
You can count on us, Papa.

317
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,566
They can see us! Camouflage.

318
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,235
Blend in.

319
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,792
Well, I guess this is our stop. Let's go.

320
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,420
We get to climb another tree.

321
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,964
Watch out, watch out.
Hang on, everybody. Hang on!

322
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,632
- Brainy.
- That's it.

323
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,762
- Thanks a lot. Have a good night.
- I hope Clumsy can breathe in that box.

324
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,514
How are we supposed to
find Clumsy in there?

325
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:42,850
- I could attempt to smurf the probability...
- Brainy!

326
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,478
- We'll look through every window.
- I don't do windows.

327
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:47,521
- Now, let's get smurfing.
- You heard him. Come on.

328
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:50,107
- Every window?
- Piece of cake.

329
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,860
- Grace?
- Hello?

330
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,446
Guess what? Guess what, guess what?

331
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,367
Okay. They invented a zero-calorie pizza.

332
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,119
- No, but that's a good idea.
- Yes. They found...

333
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:04,955
Baby kicked.

334
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,501
- Hi.
- Hi.

335
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:09,877
Please say hello.

336
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:20,679
- Please.
- Hello, little Sea-Monkey.

337
00:20:21,472 --> 00:20:23,808
This is the sound of my voice.

338
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,895
Hello, son or daughter. Hello.

339
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,648
Hello.

340
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:33,984
That is not the sound of your voice.
That is the voice of a robot.

341
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,570
Our child is gonna be
attached to the toaster.

342
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:38,823
Or the new VP of marketing.

343
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,910
No. No! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my gosh!

344
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,078
- It's...
- It's provisional.

345
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:47,206
If I wow Cruella de Odile,
then I'll keep the job.

346
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:50,501
If not, then my head'll be on a pike
next to the last guy.

347
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,962
Well, wow you will! You wowed me.

348
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,588
But I have two days.

349
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,799
- Yikes.
- I know.

350
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,968
What if I don't get them done in time?

351
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,011
Oh, no, you can't come to the ultrasound.

352
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:04,932
Unless...

353
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,893
Wait, the backup ads we have
did fine in focus groups.

354
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,855
I could retool those.
I'd have to work around the clock.

355
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:17,486
Azrael, we've come so far,

356
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,740
yet ever am I haunted by
the same familiar riddle.

357
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:25,870
How to find the Smurfs?

358
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:28,372
If only I...

359
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,543
I'm sorry, is my thinking
interrupting your vile hacking?

360
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:36,922
If only I had something of theirs.
A drop of spittle. A fingernail.

361
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:42,386
Some hair, even.
Then I could make some Smurf magic.

362
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:47,558
Very nice. Are you done now?

363
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:49,059
I don't want to look at it.

364
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:52,396
What? What?

365
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:59,320
Is that... No. No, it can't be.

366
00:21:59,612 --> 00:22:01,238
It is.

367
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:05,618
The tawny locks of Smurfette.

368
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:13,918
Sweet follicular ambrosia!
Silky strands of joy.

369
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:18,088
Mixed with a fair amount of cat vomit.

370
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:23,594
Yes. Yes, I am a genius!

371
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,599
With my skills, even this small trifle
of smurfiness

372
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:32,186
will yield me just enough power
to catch them all!

373
00:22:33,771 --> 00:22:39,527
I must find a laboratory with which to tease
the magic from these precious little strands.

374
00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:49,161
Yes. It's a bit small,
but this should do nicely!

375
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,457
It's even got its own cauldron.

376
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:57,461
What died in here?

377
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:01,131
Open. Open. Open. Open. Open!

378
00:23:05,678 --> 00:23:10,182
Somebody's been working a dark
and terrible magic in there.

379
00:23:17,982 --> 00:23:19,858
What is that?

380
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:39,420
Oh, baby.

381
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:43,882
Daddy is home.

382
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:47,720
Come on.

383
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:51,348
Papa, I'm familiar with 613 shades of blue,

384
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:53,309
- and that moon is not one of them.
- Papa?

385
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:58,105
Stay calm, everyone. If the portal
opened once, it can open again.

386
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:02,067
How are we gonna open a magical portal
when we can't even find Clumsy?

387
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,736
Hey, I think I see something up there.

388
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,223
Oh, no.

389
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:47,071
Clumsy? Is that you?

390
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:48,739
Hello.

391
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:52,409
Help! Help!

392
00:24:58,248 --> 00:24:59,917
Oh, smurf.

393
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,261
Hey.

394
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:13,514
"Berry Boom."

395
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:40,457
Patrick!

396
00:25:57,975 --> 00:25:59,977
Elway. Elway.

397
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,646
I'm sure this is the box.
When I get my hands on him...

398
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,022
- Someone's coming!
- Smurfs!

399
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:05,190
What is it?

400
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:09,319
No, no!

401
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,031
No, no, no, no. Come on, come on, come on.
Please, please.

402
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,742
Elway.

403
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:18,495
Elway. Did you do that?

404
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,789
- Come on, put a little smurf into it.
- Hang on, Clumsy.

405
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:22,666
- I got this side.
- All together now.

406
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,376
- Crikey.
- Oh, dear.

407
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:25,878
Hold on.

408
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:27,921
- Now what, lads?
- What happened to Clumsy?

409
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:29,673
- I bet they ate him. Let's go home.
- Hide.

410
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:32,384
- Go! Pull the lid!
- Dive! Dive!

411
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:39,224
Gross.

412
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:45,355
This is so...

413
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:04,416
- That's Clumsy!
- Charge, Smurfs! Charge!

414
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:06,710
- Out of the way, big guy.
- Clumsy, we're coming!

415
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:07,878
Excuse me. Pardon me.

416
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,047
- This is for Clumsy!
- Wait for me!

417
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,216
- Oh, God!
- Please don't hurt me!

418
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:14,760
- Please, I just want to go home!
- Are you...

419
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:19,389
Did you just talk?

420
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:23,185
I'm not saying till you put down
the giant spiky thing.

421
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:24,728
- Clumsy!
- Clumsy, where are you?

422
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:26,396
- Make yourself known!
- Smurf us a sign!

423
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,315
- Come out, Clumsy!
- Smurf out, smurf out, wherever you are.

424
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,234
- Are you there?
- Come to my voice, laddie!

425
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:31,735
- Where are you?
- Can you hear us?

426
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:34,279
- Get out of here!
- Look out!

427
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:37,366
- Too much aggression!
- Go back to the sewers!

428
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:38,742
Kiss my smurf!

429
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:42,120
You all find Clumsy! The giant is mine!

430
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,414
- Over here!
- Get him!

431
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:46,834
Have you had enough? Tap out?

432
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:51,338
Okay, so you're like... You're blue, and...

433
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,800
- Oh, gosh, are you okay?
- Quickly!

434
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,134
- This way! This way!
- Follow me, Smurfs!

435
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,262
- Clumsy! Where are you?
- Look out!

436
00:27:58,345 --> 00:27:59,596
Other way! Other way!

437
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,139
- Run, Smurfs!
- Come on!

438
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,850
Run!

439
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,935
Elway!

440
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:07,354
- Smurf for your lives!
- Clumsy, where the smurf are you?

441
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:09,940
- Stinky breath.
- Spread out!

442
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,776
Grace! Run!

443
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:17,155
Stop bleating like a sheep and let
me hog-tie you, you wriggly numptie.

444
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:19,449
Grace, we're being attacked!

445
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,119
Do not be fooled by their cuteness!

446
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:24,538
It's okay, it's okay.

447
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:28,792
They're friendly.

448
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:31,169
You're lucky your lassie stepped in.

449
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:34,339
I was about to make haggis
with your innards.

450
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:46,018
This is it. This is it, Azrael!

451
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:50,230
Smurfette's hair goes in here,
flows through the Smurf essence extractor,

452
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:52,733
and finally, I have my Smurfilator!

453
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:57,237
It's the pièce de résistance.
The crème de la...

454
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:01,116
Would you care for a mint when you're done?

455
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:03,994
Yes, yes, yes!

456
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:05,871
With this precious elixir,

457
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:12,836
my sorcerous spell shall be powerful
beyond all measurable measurement.

458
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:21,678
This one tiny drop will give me
the power to capture them all.

459
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,440
This is great!

460
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,402
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long

461
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:41,740
Next time you're feeling blue
Just let a smile begin

462
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:46,161
Happy things will come to you
So smurf yourself a grin

463
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:48,830
It's so obvious
that what you're doing is wrong.

464
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:50,374
Oh, really? After you.

465
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:51,875
How crazy is this?

466
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:55,212
There are little blue people
singing in our kitchen!

467
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:01,635
So you're sticking with your
"this is actually happening" theory?

468
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:03,387
Sorry.

469
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:08,350
Okay. It says here Smurfs are
mythical creatures from Belgium,

470
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,560
- also known as Schtroumpfs...
- Yeah.

471
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:12,437
Documented by Peyo.

472
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:16,858
Also says that they bring good luck.
Like leprechauns to the Irish.

473
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:19,403
It says they're mythical, Grace.

474
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,446
- I'm so sorry, Master Winslow.
- That was great.

475
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:23,073
Well, they look pretty real to me.

476
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,574
Come on.

477
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:30,706
- Excuse me.
- Okay, to review.

478
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:35,293
You guys come from a magic forest
where you live in oversized mushrooms.

479
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:37,462
- Yes.
- You're being chased by an evil wizard.

480
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:38,964
- Yeah.
- And you're trapped in New York

481
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:40,674
- until there's a blue moon...
- Very good.

482
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,635
And you like to use the
extremely imprecise term "smurf"

483
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,929
- for just about everything.
- Smurfxactly.

484
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:50,976
And you're all
named after your personalities?

485
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:54,604
Do you get your names when you're born,
or after you've exhibited certain traits?

486
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:55,856
- Yeah.
- Yep.

487
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,190
Yeah, whatever.

488
00:30:57,274 --> 00:31:00,444
Master Winslow, there must be
something about the blue moon

489
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:02,154
on your magic window machine.

490
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:05,032
Just what is this magic searching device?

491
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:06,867
Right now, I'm using Google.

492
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,829
- Google.
- Google.

493
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:18,253
Okay. "Blue moon.
A full moon that occurs twice in one month.

494
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:20,005
"A figurative construct..."

495
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:22,007
- Much like yourselves.
- Hey!

496
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:24,885
"But the moon itself
doesn't appear to be blue."

497
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:26,303
- What?
- Not blue?

498
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,096
- Perfect!
- Now we'll never get home!

499
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,225
No cause for alarm, my little Smurfs.
If we're to open the portal home,

500
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:34,144
I'll just have to smurf us a potion

501
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,604
to invoke the blue moon.

502
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,022
You hear that, honey?

503
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:39,524
They're only staying till
an actual blue moon rises.

504
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:43,153
Which could happen if the little blue
Santa man makes a magic potion,

505
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,947
which, at this point,
seems completely plausible.

506
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:47,699
- Want a bite?
- No, thank you.

507
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:51,495
Of course, the stars will
need to be perfectly aligned.

508
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:56,041
And when that might be is hard to determine
without the proper instrument.

509
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,960
Master Winslow,
might I borrow your stargazer?

510
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,170
My what-whatzer?

511
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:03,048
He doesn't have a stargazer. Do you?

512
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,967
- This is all my fault.
- We're all gonna die.

513
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:08,804
- We're all gonna die!
- Smurf out of it, scaredy-brains!

514
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:10,347
- One Panicky Smurf is enough!
- Hey!

515
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:14,518
Besides, Papa had a vision,
and everything turns out smurf y.

516
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:16,019
Right, Papa?

517
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:22,359
Yes, yes. It all turns out just fine.

518
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:30,784
We must find this Smurf thief.
Stop your complaining.

519
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,869
If I were a Smurf, where would I go?

520
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:36,373
You there, you there. Fancy pants.
Have you seen any little blue men?

521
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:39,000
- Absolutely. What price are we talking about?
- You're selling them?

522
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:41,169
- Have you looked in the drawer, sweetie?
- Wait, what drawer?

523
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:43,755
- In the kitchen, Lilly.
- Who is this Lilly?

524
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,258
Are you kidding?
She's the hottest girl in my department.

525
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:48,552
Please, please. Please, young woodsman.

526
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:53,056
What does the temperature of this Lilly
have to do with the finding of Smurfs?

527
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,725
- Take your meds, man.
- What?

528
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,729
Is everyone in this realm
completely insane?

529
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:04,734
Thank the gods, a local wizard. Excellent.

530
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:06,987
Pardon me, wise sir?

531
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,322
By any chance, have you seen
any little blue men?

532
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,617
They're everywhere!

533
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:15,787
I knew it. I knew it!
I told you we were close, Azrael.

534
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:22,502
Now, just take one, everybody. We have
to make sure our smurf berries last.

535
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,921
Great. We're gonna be here how long?

536
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:27,507
Not long. First, we have
to get a stargazer.

537
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:30,844
Next, find a book of spells
and then smurf a portal

538
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:34,347
and we're home.
Very simple, my little Smurfs.

539
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,057
Bye, Elway.

540
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:38,435
Someone looks smurfalish!

541
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:40,687
- Why you wearing a leash?
- It's a tie.

542
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,023
- Does it keep your neck warm?
- No.

543
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:46,818
Clearly, it functions as an aid in his
craft, like a blacksmith's apron.

544
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:49,112
I wear it because it's what
everyone wears at work.

545
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:51,323
What are you, you pasty giant?

546
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:55,577
I try to get people to buy things
by analyzing market trend predictions.

547
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,414
Predictions! He's a fortune teller.

548
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:02,042
Look, I would love to explain
but I am super late. I gotta go.

549
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:04,211
- I really don't have time for this.
- What?

550
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:06,004
You had one outfit on,

551
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:09,090
and now you're wearing something
completely different.

552
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:10,467
- Yeah. It...
- Now, Smurfette,

553
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,677
she probably got the other one dirty.

554
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:14,596
- Let's not embarrass her.
- Sorry.

555
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,057
Thanks for letting us stay in
your mushroom, Miss Grace.

556
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:21,061
- It's really nice.
- Well, thank you. I'm glad you like it.

557
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:25,857
I like our little mushroom, too. But you
know, somebody wants a bigger mushroom.

558
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:28,818
But, then you'd be further apart.

559
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:32,072
You said it, sister. Okay, I've gotta go.
I've got an appointment.

560
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,823
I've got a baby on the way, so...

561
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:37,244
Wait, wait. We can't just
leave them here alone, without an adult.

562
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:40,580
I'm 546 years old.

563
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:42,207
Of course you are.

564
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:43,833
- They'll be fine. They'll be fine.
- All right.

565
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,086
- Love you.
- Okay.

566
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,046
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, Grace! Goodbye.

567
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,507
By the way, I wouldn't go anywhere
if I were you.

568
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:51,883
Why not?

569
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:56,429
Our world doesn't do well
with visitors from other places.

570
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:58,223
I mean, look what happened to E.T.

571
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:01,726
It's a movie. A moving picture.

572
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:04,229
Book. Just stay, okay?

573
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:08,483
Great. He's gone
and we still don't have a stargazer.

574
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:12,737
Wait a smurf. If he's a fortune teller,
he reads stars all the time.

575
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:16,116
Ergo, it's at his place of business.

576
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:17,951
Excellent work, Brainy.

577
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:19,995
What are we waiting for? Let's ride.

578
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:21,913
- Yeah, come on, guys.
- Hey, stop it.

579
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,749
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Let's go get that stargazer.

580
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:28,253
- Surprise, surprise.
- Oh, no.

581
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:32,007
Clumsy, I think it might be best

582
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,217
if you stay here. You know?

583
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:36,761
Smurf an eye on the mushroom.

584
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:43,560
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

585
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:46,187
- This way, Smurfs!
- Let's follow Mr. Winslow.

586
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,857
Well, I can smurf an eye on the mushroom.

587
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,650
Smurf away!

588
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,902
- Let's smurf this joint.
- Is he down there?

589
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,195
- Taxi!
- Can you see him?

590
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,698
Look, he's getting into
the mechanical wagon.

591
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:58,283
- Oh, no.
- Clearly that distance is too great...

592
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:01,036
- Off you go!
- No! Gutsy!

593
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,079
Come on, Smurfs! Smurfabunga!

594
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:04,914
Goodbye, blue world.

595
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:06,750
Use your hat, you ninny!

596
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,919
Couldn't we just have taken the stairs?

597
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:12,422
- There we go.
- Not funny, Gutsy.

598
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,467
- It was a little funny.
- Smurfs.

599
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,595
We're stopping. Hold on tight.

600
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:20,013
Not to me, Grouchy.

601
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,599
Oh, did I do that? Sorry.

602
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:24,768
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, man.

603
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:27,479
Master Winslow, we really need your help.

604
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:28,688
- Hey.
- Right here.

605
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:29,939
What are you doing here?

606
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:33,818
What part of "we need a stargazer"
don't you understand, you numptie?

607
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:37,614
- You can't be out in public.
- Who are you talking to?

608
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:41,076
If we could just have a quick look around
in your predicting parlor...

609
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:43,244
- We really wanna go home.
- Come on, man, I gotta go.

610
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:45,455
- Fine. Just come here, come here.
- Please, please.

611
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,165
All of you. Trust me.

612
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:48,958
Careful. Hey, watch the smurf berries.

613
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:51,461
I'm not going... Hey!

614
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:53,671
- Be quiet.
- It's dark in here.

615
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:55,131
All right, who smurf ed?

616
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:57,967
Hey! Get your hand out of my kilt.

617
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:00,887
- That's not my hand.
- Hey, ticklish.

618
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,934
- Morning. Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Winslow.

619
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:08,019
- Congratulations on your promotion.
- Thank you.

620
00:37:08,144 --> 00:37:10,188
I hope you guys like desk drawers,
because that's where...

621
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:12,482
- You're late.
- Odile!

622
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:14,401
You were in my office.

623
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:17,487
It's my building,
and we have much work to do.

624
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,740
The launch for Jouvenel is tomorrow night.
Is your concept ready?

625
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:23,660
Close. I had a crazy morning.

626
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:25,870
What are you doing?

627
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:30,250
Nothing. I'm excited.
I'm excited about all the concept ideas.

628
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:35,171
And hungry. Sorry. Hungry for its success.

629
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:36,756
Nervous energy.

630
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,883
Nervous energy's what's
going on up in here.

631
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:40,176
- I like it.
- Yep.

632
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:44,180
- The fear of failure is a fabulous motivator.
- True that.

633
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:46,516
Hey! Stop it.

634
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,352
- Henri.
- Make it work.

635
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:51,354
You have no idea.

636
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:53,773
- What is this?
- Why did I get the armpit?

637
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:57,402
- Stop pushing me.
- Go easy on the cologne tomorrow.

638
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:59,362
Are you crazy?

639
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:01,322
- You're gonna get me fired.
- My hair!

640
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:04,659
I couldn't even breathe in there. It
smelled like the business end of a sheep.

641
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:06,077
- I don't see a stargazer.
- How you doing?

642
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:10,081
I'm sorry, Master Winslow,
but we badly need to borrow your stargazer.

643
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:13,877
I don't have a stargazer, okay?

644
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,506
It's not something people of this century
just have, especially here.

645
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,552
- Not happy.
- Now if you'll excuse me, I have to work.

646
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:26,139
Well, perhaps we could sing
to help things along.

647
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:29,517
And then we'll get the stargazer.
Come along, Smurfs.

648
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:32,937
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

649
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:35,565
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long

650
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:37,650
Stop.

651
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:39,068
La la la la la la

652
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:40,278
Stop!

653
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:42,280
Sing a happy song

654
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:45,450
Come on. None of you find that song
just the tiniest bit annoying?

655
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:46,993
I find it annoying.

656
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,913
Well, what do you sing at work?

657
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:52,290
- I don't sing at work.
- What?

658
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:54,375
- And you have to wear a leash.
- Harsh.

659
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,753
I know. How about if we hum?

660
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:00,590
Please stop humming.

661
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:08,765
I need to hone my message here.

662
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,099
I've got a message.

663
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:14,020
"Always chew with your mouth closed."
Papa taught us that.

664
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:15,980
That's good. You should use that.

665
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:18,024
Or, "Dance and be happy."

666
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:20,068
How about, "Grab life by the grapes"?

667
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:23,238
- "Turn that frown upside down."
- "Always bet on blue."

668
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:26,699
- "Have a smurf y day."
- "I kissed a Smurf and I liked it"?

669
00:39:27,617 --> 00:39:30,203
It's an embarrassment of riches.

670
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:31,663
They're giving you gold here.

671
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:33,706
- Thank you.
- Master Winslow,

672
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,293
you'll know it's the right message
if it comes from the heart.

673
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:38,670
- Right, Smurfs?
- Yeah.

674
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:40,004
- You said it.
- Absolutely.

675
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:42,298
- Of course.
- Welcome to my world.

676
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:50,056
I love emerging dramatically
through the smoke.

677
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:57,855
It makes... It makes me feel
so deliciously mysterious.

678
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:02,318
Also, it gives the skin a wonderful glow.

679
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:03,653
What?

680
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,029
Where? Where?

681
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,408
What?

682
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:14,163
Curses! So close.

683
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:16,332
What?

684
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:21,379
Theirs is upside-down.

685
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,841
Idiots. They painted it wrong.
Come, Azrael.

686
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:27,010
- Hi.
- Hello.

687
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:28,136
What are you doing?

688
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:30,555
Just greening things up a bit.

689
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,350
That's so sweet. That's very sweet but,

690
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:36,978
you know, I'm not so sure
this stuff's gonna grow out here.

691
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:40,690
We'll see. Smurfs have a very blue thumb.

692
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:42,817
So where is everybody else?

693
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,527
They went to get a stargazer

694
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:46,904
so Papa can smurf a blue moon
to get us home.

695
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,239
And they went without you?

696
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:51,242
Yeah. I mean, who knows why?

697
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:55,413
- Hey!
- Sorry!

698
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:57,123
Why don't we come inside?

699
00:40:57,206 --> 00:41:00,043
- Smurfs, where are you?
- Make sure to demonstrate that

700
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:02,211
this new anti-aging cream can make

701
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:07,842
any woman look beautiful, young, vibrant.
It's almost magical.

702
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:10,053
Astonishing, really.

703
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:15,475
I see no transformation.

704
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:17,935
- Your potion has no power.
- Excuse me?

705
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:20,855
Well, she's still an eye-offending dogfish,
if you ask me.

706
00:41:20,938 --> 00:41:24,400
- Sir!
- This is my mother who you're speaking of.

707
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:27,028
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize.

708
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:28,738
How sad for you in 30 years.

709
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:31,949
Henri, escort this lunatic out.

710
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:33,284
- "Lunatic"?
- Security!

711
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:35,995
I am the great and powerful Gargamel!

712
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,083
"Lunatic." Could a lunatic do this?

713
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:42,752
Alakazootiful!

714
00:41:57,433 --> 00:41:58,810
How did you do that?

715
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:01,104
Yes, and seriously, me next.

716
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:05,775
So sorry, but lunatics and great wizards
never reveal their secrets.

717
00:42:07,443 --> 00:42:10,613
Come, Azrael! Now, where are my Smurfs?

718
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,365
No, no, no, no, no. Don't go.

719
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:15,159
- I need to know what you just did.
- Not telling.

720
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:18,454
Please, señor. Can you do that again?

721
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:22,291
You may attempt to persuade me.

722
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:26,003
What is it that you desire?

723
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:28,464
Riches?

724
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:30,800
Fame?

725
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:33,136
Fortune?

726
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,847
With my help,

727
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:42,562
the whole world
will know the name that is Garbagesmell.

728
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:45,648
Gargamel.

729
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:53,156
Yes. With my help, the whole world
will know the genius that is Gargamel.

730
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,826
I'm...

731
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:03,416
I'm sorry. Did you just say "genius"?

732
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:08,004
So, even though
I'm what you might call accident-prone,

733
00:43:08,171 --> 00:43:11,257
on the bright side, I did
land us all here in your little mushroom,

734
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:12,925
and we got to meet you and Patrick.

735
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,512
You're so sweet. And I know how you feel.
I'm so clumsy, too.

736
00:43:17,096 --> 00:43:18,556
Well, I used to be.

737
00:43:18,848 --> 00:43:20,099
- Really?
- Yeah.

738
00:43:20,558 --> 00:43:23,352
So how long did it take you to...

739
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:26,522
Gosh.

740
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:28,775
...un-fumble your feet?

741
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:34,614
Well, about as long as it takes to realize
that nobody's just one thing.

742
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:37,366
You can be anything you wanna be.

743
00:43:39,368 --> 00:43:41,871
- "Hero Smurf."
- Yeah.

744
00:43:43,414 --> 00:43:44,540
Probably not.

745
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,878
- Hey, Brainy, help me figure this out.
- Let me show you.

746
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:50,546
First, you put your...

747
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:52,924
Works every time.

748
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:55,468
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

749
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:59,055
This is a fascinating wind machine
you have here.

750
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:07,188
- Hi, Patrick.
- Grace, help. Help!

751
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:10,066
They are everywhere
and they won't stop singing.

752
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:13,736
I cannot get a thing done.
Please come and get these guys.

753
00:44:16,948 --> 00:44:18,658
Señor Gargamel, I'll be frank.

754
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:24,997
Clinique, Lancôme, MAC. They will kill
to get what you have in that ring.

755
00:44:25,248 --> 00:44:26,749
Not if we kill them first.

756
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:31,420
Let's see, we're going to need some
knights, preferably in shining armor,

757
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:34,590
some bowmen, poison arrows.

758
00:44:35,258 --> 00:44:36,592
I like the way you think.

759
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:38,469
And some spikes to mount their heads on.

760
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:40,137
Well, it is all about the presentation.

761
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:44,183
And, of course, all of our testing
would be animal cruelty-free?

762
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:47,186
What, they pay extra for the
animal cruelty? Is that it?

763
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:48,604
Get out of here.

764
00:44:52,316 --> 00:44:54,402
You have a wicked sense of humor.

765
00:44:54,485 --> 00:44:56,487
- We like that, don't we?
- Hey, out of here!

766
00:44:56,612 --> 00:44:57,780
Henri?

767
00:44:58,447 --> 00:44:59,615
I said, get out of here.

768
00:44:59,782 --> 00:45:04,036
Señor Gargamel,
now you must assure me, darling,

769
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:08,040
that you can recreate whatever it was
that you did to my mother,

770
00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:10,293
but on a massive scale.

771
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:14,297
Do that, and the world will worship you.

772
00:45:14,797 --> 00:45:16,883
Did you hear that, Azrael?

773
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:24,265
"Worship." Oh, it rolls off the tongue
like flesh from a... Not pilgrim...

774
00:45:26,058 --> 00:45:27,476
Heretic. Yes, thank you.

775
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:31,689
Thank the gods, a chamber pot.

776
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:36,152
This swill that you call Dom Pérignon
has gone straight to my nether regions.

777
00:45:46,704 --> 00:45:50,166
Here, toss this out the window, yeah?
Today, please.

778
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:53,920
Now, to the matter at hand.

779
00:45:54,754 --> 00:45:56,422
So do we have a deal, señor?

780
00:45:58,049 --> 00:46:00,343
Not quite, my sweet maiden.

781
00:46:00,426 --> 00:46:06,182
You see, first I must have my Smurfs.

782
00:46:09,226 --> 00:46:12,772
You guys just have to understand that
Patrick's under a lot of pressure right now.

783
00:46:12,855 --> 00:46:14,941
So if you could just lay
low for a little bit...

784
00:46:15,024 --> 00:46:18,611
You have my word of honor, Miss Grace.
My Smurfs will not move from this bag.

785
00:46:18,694 --> 00:46:20,363
- Okay, good.
- Stargazer!

786
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:22,865
- What?
- Stargazer! Let's go!

787
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:24,033
- Everybody out! Come on!
- No, no, no!

788
00:46:24,116 --> 00:46:25,201
- Guys, let's go!
- No, no, no, no, no!

789
00:46:25,451 --> 00:46:27,370
- Full smurf ahead.
- No, wait, wait!

790
00:46:27,703 --> 00:46:28,746
Hit the deck!

791
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:31,874
Hey, I'm walking here! I'm walking!

792
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:33,709
- Save me!
- Hey, look out, Brainy.

793
00:46:33,793 --> 00:46:35,378
Can't everyone just slow down

794
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:36,545
- and enjoy life?
- Get off me. Get off!

795
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:37,713
Wait for it.

796
00:46:38,047 --> 00:46:39,423
I gotta get me one of those.

797
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:40,800
Oh, my gosh!

798
00:46:40,883 --> 00:46:42,593
- Hey, lady! Hey!
- Wait, wait. Hold on!

799
00:46:42,718 --> 00:46:46,555
When we get inside, spread out
and find that stargazer.

800
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:47,807
Come on, Smurfs!

801
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:12,248
- Hey.
- Patrick, the Smurfs have gone AWOL.

802
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:13,499
Grace, are you running?

803
00:47:13,582 --> 00:47:15,084
No, no, I'm totally fine,
but they need your help!

804
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:17,003
Patrick, I'm afraid they're gonna
get themselves killed!

805
00:47:17,086 --> 00:47:19,213
Sweetie, they're fine.
They can send us a tiny thank-you note

806
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:21,424
when they get back to shroom town.
Right after they invent paper.

807
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:22,758
Patrick, they need you.

808
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:24,427
- Honey...
- Patrick, I need you.

809
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,928
Oh, my gosh, please hurry!

810
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:27,471
All right. Where are you?

811
00:47:28,097 --> 00:47:32,977
The man is a lunatic. It's not going to
work. I don't know, he needs Smoops.

812
00:47:33,102 --> 00:47:34,145
- "Smurfs."
- Smarps.

813
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:37,106
No, no, "Smurfs." "Smurfs" with an...

814
00:47:37,273 --> 00:47:38,399
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

815
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:39,817
You call that groveling, you fool?

816
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,320
Every village has an idiot. What?

817
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:48,367
You're right. That's him!
Stop! Stop! Smurf thief!

818
00:47:48,617 --> 00:47:50,119
Smurf thief!

819
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:51,746
Come on, guys, the dolls are here!

820
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:55,624
Stargazer, stargazer, stargazer. Stargazer,
stargazer, stargazer, stargazer...

821
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,463
So that's where all the unicorns went.

822
00:48:00,629 --> 00:48:03,424
I'm not afraid to go off on my own,
I thought you might like the company.

823
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:04,967
Fine. Then hang on.

824
00:48:07,636 --> 00:48:11,182
A Smurf cannon! The only way to fly.

825
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:13,726
Perfect.

826
00:48:15,686 --> 00:48:19,398
Time to catch some air! Smurfabunga!

827
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:21,984
That'll put some air up your skirt!

828
00:48:25,196 --> 00:48:27,031
Gotta be a stargazer up here somewhere.

829
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:28,491
Predator!

830
00:48:31,494 --> 00:48:32,912
Smurf droppings.

831
00:48:35,164 --> 00:48:38,334
These are disgustingly tasty.

832
00:48:40,544 --> 00:48:41,837
Hello.

833
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:44,673
Oh, creepy.

834
00:48:44,757 --> 00:48:47,760
I hope they weren't looking
for a stargazer, too.

835
00:48:47,843 --> 00:48:49,512
Stargazers, stargazers...

836
00:48:49,595 --> 00:48:50,805
Dresses!

837
00:48:50,888 --> 00:48:54,308
You mean I can have
more than one kind of dress?

838
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:55,434
What?

839
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:57,561
Papa, I'm telling you,
we're never gonna find those...

840
00:48:57,686 --> 00:48:59,730
- Stargazers.
- They're dangerously high.

841
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:02,274
You're right.
We're gonna need something tall.

842
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:12,326
- Don't you think someone will notice us?
- Just act natural.

843
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:14,036
- I'm a bear.
- Brainy!

844
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:17,706
I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming, guys.

845
00:49:17,873 --> 00:49:19,708
Hold still, stairs!

846
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:21,627
Look at the stair-climbing toy!

847
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:22,878
- Hey.
- What is that?

848
00:49:23,045 --> 00:49:24,088
- Let me see it.
- Careful.

849
00:49:24,213 --> 00:49:26,132
- I want one, too, Mommy!
- Let me see.

850
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:28,717
I'm just tired of the whole dating game.

851
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:32,096
Just say who you are
and be who you say, right?

852
00:49:32,972 --> 00:49:34,682
I can't seem to get it to scan.

853
00:49:34,765 --> 00:49:37,059
My son wants one of those
blue animatronic things.

854
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:39,270
Can you help me out here?
Do they come in pink?

855
00:49:39,395 --> 00:49:40,813
- My daughter wants pink.
- I'm sorry.

856
00:49:40,896 --> 00:49:42,189
What aisle did you find this on?

857
00:49:42,273 --> 00:49:43,357
- I'll take the floor model.
- I was here first.

858
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,402
- There's a line.
- Can I interest you in a Coldy Holdy Ice Bat?

859
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:47,736
What? Ice Bat?

860
00:49:48,112 --> 00:49:49,405
It comes in pink.

861
00:49:53,742 --> 00:49:55,494
Smurf thief! Stop!

862
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,131
Do I use my grouchiness as a wall
because I'm afraid to be vulnerable?

863
00:50:07,298 --> 00:50:08,591
You bet.

864
00:50:08,757 --> 00:50:10,342
Smurf!

865
00:50:10,426 --> 00:50:11,760
But I've got feelings.

866
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:15,264
No. No, I can't be out already!
What was I thinking?

867
00:50:15,347 --> 00:50:18,934
Wasting my only drop of Smurf essence
on that old hag?

868
00:50:26,275 --> 00:50:28,444
It's a big problem, sir.
We don't seem to have it in stock.

869
00:50:28,527 --> 00:50:31,947
Hey! Keep your smurfs to yourselves!

870
00:50:32,531 --> 00:50:35,576
- Don't you people have any boundaries?
- Grab it!

871
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:37,203
I'm not a toy!

872
00:50:37,286 --> 00:50:38,454
- Where is she?
- Where'd she go?

873
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:39,580
- There she is!
- There she is!

874
00:50:39,663 --> 00:50:41,040
Hey, this dress is mine!

875
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:43,792
- Smurfette!
- Wait, I'm shopping.

876
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:46,295
- Let's shop later.
- Go! Come on!

877
00:50:47,504 --> 00:50:49,215
- Patrick! Patrick, help!
- Clumsy, come here!

878
00:50:49,506 --> 00:50:52,509
A giant's after me! She's huge!

879
00:50:53,052 --> 00:50:54,637
Hey, that's mine!

880
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,847
Sorry, little girl, this one's not for...

881
00:50:57,056 --> 00:50:58,849
- Mommy!
- Really?

882
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:04,980
Don't ever forget that one magical moment
our two worlds met.

883
00:51:05,064 --> 00:51:07,149
And I wasn't grouchy, I wasn't.

884
00:51:09,193 --> 00:51:13,530
Can you just say one thing, please?
I'm dying here.

885
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:14,990
Hey!

886
00:51:15,324 --> 00:51:16,825
That's one!

887
00:51:17,493 --> 00:51:20,287
Technically, when loading cargo
onto the head of a bear,

888
00:51:20,371 --> 00:51:22,581
- one should distribute the weight...
- Brainy, just pull.

889
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:25,751
Ahoy, mateys! What are ya waiting for?
We're drawin' a crowd.

890
00:51:26,502 --> 00:51:28,629
- Show-off.
- Oh, dear. They think we're toys.

891
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:31,840
Hold onto your knickers, boys,
it's about to get grisly.

892
00:51:31,924 --> 00:51:35,302
- Don't let me fall!
- Just hang onto that stargazer, you two!

893
00:51:35,386 --> 00:51:36,637
- Hey! Come on, Smurfs!
- They're getting away!

894
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,013
Let's go, go, go!

895
00:51:38,097 --> 00:51:40,224
I'll have you at ramming speed in no time.

896
00:51:40,349 --> 00:51:42,518
- Hold on!
- I think we lost them.

897
00:51:43,352 --> 00:51:44,812
- Again with the head.
- Oh, dear.

898
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:47,898
- Out of the way or I'll caber toss ya!
- Where did you learn how to drive?

899
00:51:48,023 --> 00:51:50,442
- You think you can do better?
- Yes, I do believe I can do better.

900
00:51:53,112 --> 00:51:54,863
Two more!

901
00:51:55,364 --> 00:51:57,908
- Brainy! Gutsy!
- Papa!

902
00:52:00,202 --> 00:52:01,537
Grace, that's Gargamel!

903
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:08,252
- Oh, you again! Get your paws off me!
- No, no, no, no.

904
00:52:09,295 --> 00:52:10,713
Bad kitty!

905
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,423
Oh, I hate that cat!

906
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:20,639
Gargamel.

907
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:22,349
Smurfette.

908
00:52:22,433 --> 00:52:24,810
More lovely than ever.

909
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,397
Oh, Gargamel,
I guess you've outsmarted us again.

910
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:30,941
Or not!

911
00:52:32,735 --> 00:52:36,739
Azrael. Azrael, what are you doing?
Get out of my suckamajig!

912
00:52:37,614 --> 00:52:39,158
- Get out!
- Let me help you with that.

913
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:43,912
Oh, thank you, kind... You! You...

914
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:49,960
Yahoo!

915
00:52:52,504 --> 00:52:53,672
- Patrick.
- Hey.

916
00:52:55,466 --> 00:52:56,884
- Impressive.
- Thanks.

917
00:52:56,967 --> 00:52:58,594
- I'll get the stargazer.
- I'll get the Smurfs.

918
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:09,897
That's him! He took it right off my back!
Leaf-blower thief!

919
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,774
Please stand up, sir.
You're going downtown.

920
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,194
- Do not resist. Do not resist!
- Unhand me. Unhand me, you heathens!

921
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:19,448
Or suffer the wrath
of the great and powerful...

922
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:27,998
Let me... Let me see here...

923
00:53:50,521 --> 00:53:52,981
How can you be the only
girl in the village?

924
00:53:53,065 --> 00:53:56,693
Well, see, I wasn't brought
by a stork like the others.

925
00:53:57,861 --> 00:54:01,490
I was created by Gargamel
to trap the other Smurfs.

926
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,576
Wow. And then what happened?

927
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:06,161
Papa saved me.

928
00:54:06,245 --> 00:54:11,166
He cast a special spell and then helped me
become the Smurf I was meant to be.

929
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:13,168
No. Play it safe.

930
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:24,513
"Odile, pending your approval,
it's ready to go to the billboard agency."

931
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:30,269
Well, here goes nothing.

932
00:54:32,354 --> 00:54:35,524
- Papa should be done by now.
- Yeah. Enough with the suspense.

933
00:54:35,607 --> 00:54:37,693
- I wanna go home.
- Me, too.

934
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:41,572
Now that that wily wizard's got our scent,
it's a whole new wager.

935
00:54:41,697 --> 00:54:44,533
Without that blue moon,
our giblets are gravy.

936
00:54:47,453 --> 00:54:48,912
Well, it's off.

937
00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:52,374
Time to either celebrate
or file for unemployment.

938
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:55,544
Hey, what's wrong?

939
00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:57,379
- I'm sure we'll be fine.
- Oh. It's okay.

940
00:54:57,463 --> 00:55:00,048
- That one's hypersmurfilating.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

941
00:55:00,132 --> 00:55:02,050
- It's all this waitin' that's killin' us.
- Yeah.

942
00:55:02,885 --> 00:55:04,761
I know the feeling.

943
00:55:06,305 --> 00:55:08,056
Better yet...

944
00:55:08,307 --> 00:55:10,058
I know the cure.

945
00:55:12,936 --> 00:55:15,314
You just match the colors with the buttons.

946
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:25,365
You try.

947
00:55:25,449 --> 00:55:27,784
Hey! Go, Grouchy!

948
00:55:28,118 --> 00:55:29,786
- You're good!
- Nice one!

949
00:55:30,496 --> 00:55:33,665
Hey, look at me, guys! I'm shredding!

950
00:55:33,749 --> 00:55:34,917
Walk this way...

951
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,126
You sing.

952
00:55:36,251 --> 00:55:39,254
Talk this way
Just give me a kiss

953
00:55:41,298 --> 00:55:42,758
Rock face.

954
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:45,177
- It's Gene Simmons. He's a...
- Huh?

955
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,303
Never mind.

956
00:55:46,428 --> 00:55:47,763
- Like this
- Like this

957
00:55:51,517 --> 00:55:53,769
Smurfette sweetie is a classy kind of sassy

958
00:55:53,852 --> 00:55:55,687
Little skirts climbing way up her knee

959
00:55:55,771 --> 00:55:57,940
Not another single girl
in the whole smurfin' world

960
00:55:58,023 --> 00:56:00,108
- And I can't believe she's lookin' at...
- Me

961
00:56:00,192 --> 00:56:01,276
- It's a complete
- Surrender

962
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,569
- To the power of her
- Gender

963
00:56:02,653 --> 00:56:04,530
So I close my eyes and make a wish

964
00:56:04,613 --> 00:56:05,697
- I just want to
- Savor

965
00:56:05,781 --> 00:56:06,865
- All her smurf berry
- Flavor

966
00:56:06,949 --> 00:56:09,284
So I smurfed her just a little kiss
Like this

967
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:17,251
- Check out Clumsy.
- Whoa, Clumsy.

968
00:56:17,334 --> 00:56:19,211
- You found your niche.
- Yeah!

969
00:56:19,294 --> 00:56:21,630
Clumsy, holdin' it down. Look at him go!

970
00:56:22,339 --> 00:56:23,674
- Come on, Gutsy!
- Here we go!

971
00:56:23,799 --> 00:56:26,635
Yay, Gutsy! Get down with your bad smurf!

972
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:28,178
- Go, Gutsy!
- That's right.

973
00:56:29,805 --> 00:56:32,182
- Careful.
- Get your smurf on!

974
00:56:32,307 --> 00:56:33,767
- Gutsy!
- Nice!

975
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,519
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

976
00:56:35,727 --> 00:56:37,312
That was rare.

977
00:56:56,999 --> 00:57:00,085
Hey, guys. How do you like my new dress?

978
00:57:01,253 --> 00:57:03,380
Whoa! Is there a draught in here?

979
00:57:03,505 --> 00:57:06,842
Oh, okay, that's not what I had in mind.

980
00:57:08,677 --> 00:57:10,220
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

981
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:11,888
Sorry, boys.

982
00:57:13,265 --> 00:57:15,559
Yeah, that cools the giblets.

983
00:57:15,684 --> 00:57:19,187
Nothin' like a cool breeze
through my Enchanted Forest.

984
00:57:25,569 --> 00:57:27,029
- It's approved.
- What?

985
00:57:27,112 --> 00:57:29,114
- She approved it. She approved the ad!
- She loved it?

986
00:57:29,197 --> 00:57:33,035
Well, she said "approved,"
so coming from her, that's love.

987
00:57:33,285 --> 00:57:34,661
Oh, my goodness!

988
00:57:34,745 --> 00:57:36,204
- Patrick, yeah!
- You owned it!

989
00:57:36,413 --> 00:57:38,707
Oh, my goodness! Yay, Patrick!

990
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:40,876
Yeah.

991
00:57:41,543 --> 00:57:43,712
No jumping, no jumping, no jumping.
No jumping, no jumping. Okay.

992
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,423
- Should I send it? I'm not going to.
- Yes! Do it!

993
00:57:46,548 --> 00:57:47,674
- Do it this minute.
- I will do it. All right.

994
00:57:47,758 --> 00:57:49,468
Do it, do it.

995
00:57:49,551 --> 00:57:50,677
Go, go, go!

996
00:57:50,761 --> 00:57:53,388
Tomorrow this'll be on every billboard
in New York City.

997
00:57:53,555 --> 00:57:54,973
It's a go, laddie boy!

998
00:57:55,557 --> 00:57:58,518
- Well done, Master Winslow.
- Oh! Hey, guys, Papa's back.

999
00:57:58,602 --> 00:58:00,270
- Papa, are your calculations done?
- Yeah!

1000
00:58:00,562 --> 00:58:02,064
I'm nearly out of smurf berries.

1001
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:05,484
It's proving more difficult than I'd hoped.

1002
00:58:05,734 --> 00:58:07,527
But we are going home, right?

1003
00:58:07,611 --> 00:58:10,656
Of course. Just not tonight.

1004
00:58:11,907 --> 00:58:13,325
Now, off to bed.

1005
00:58:17,663 --> 00:58:21,166
I was hoping I'd be sleeping
in my mushroom tonight.

1006
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:23,168
I miss the other Smurfs.

1007
00:58:23,919 --> 00:58:25,295
Me, too.

1008
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,881
I've never spent the night away
from home before.

1009
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:32,469
Well, there was last night.
But who could sleep?

1010
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:36,598
Hush. Hush now, Smurfs.

1011
00:58:37,933 --> 00:58:40,560
Everything's going to be just fine.

1012
00:58:40,936 --> 00:58:42,187
Papa?

1013
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:46,733
Do you really believe we're ever gonna
get home to the other Smurfs?

1014
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:48,694
Don't worry.

1015
00:58:48,777 --> 00:58:51,655
We'll be reunited with the others
soon enough.

1016
00:58:56,243 --> 00:58:59,413
If only the stars would align.

1017
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:11,800
You know who I miss?
Chef Smurf. Hefty Smurf.

1018
00:59:11,925 --> 00:59:15,011
- Hey, Jokey Smurf.
- Greedy. Narrator.

1019
00:59:15,429 --> 00:59:18,098
- Painter. Baker.
- Harmony.

1020
00:59:18,181 --> 00:59:22,644
Oh, I miss Complimentary Smurf.
He always has such nice things to say.

1021
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:25,897
I'll tell you who I don't miss,
Passive-Aggressive Smurf.

1022
00:59:25,981 --> 00:59:27,149
- Aye.
- Yeah.

1023
00:59:27,274 --> 00:59:30,819
He's always so nice,
but when he leaves you feel bad.

1024
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:35,157
Ah, another wretched Smurf less night.

1025
00:59:35,824 --> 00:59:38,452
Oh, hello, little moth.

1026
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:44,374
Perhaps with your help
I'll find a way to get them back.

1027
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:48,670
Oh, you and I are kindred
spirits, little one.

1028
00:59:49,212 --> 00:59:51,256
Both of us meant to soar.

1029
00:59:51,339 --> 00:59:56,344
Go now, and bring back an army
of mighty eagles to free me.

1030
00:59:56,887 --> 01:00:00,515
Fly, tiny eagle.
Fly and bring back your brethren.

1031
01:00:00,682 --> 01:00:02,851
Fly! Fly!

1032
01:00:03,185 --> 01:00:04,519
Fly!

1033
01:00:09,191 --> 01:00:12,319
Okay. Let's see here.

1034
01:00:12,402 --> 01:00:13,528
Hey.

1035
01:00:14,154 --> 01:00:15,906
I'm guessing you have
a long night ahead of you.

1036
01:00:17,157 --> 01:00:20,410
- You guys drink coffee?
- Is a Smurf's butt blue?

1037
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:28,251
So tell me, that weird guy
in the ratty bathrobe at the toy store?

1038
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:31,087
- Gargamel?
- He's not really a wizard, is he?

1039
01:00:31,213 --> 01:00:35,258
Not the smartest of sorcerers,
but dangerous just the same.

1040
01:00:36,009 --> 01:00:37,177
Thank you.

1041
01:00:38,386 --> 01:00:42,057
Back home, I could hold him at bay
with a spell or two.

1042
01:00:42,265 --> 01:00:44,851
But here, without my books and potions...

1043
01:00:44,935 --> 01:00:49,689
Well, today we got lucky.
But next time, who knows?

1044
01:00:50,023 --> 01:00:51,233
Well, what are you gonna do?

1045
01:00:51,399 --> 01:00:55,529
I'll do anything and everything I can do
to get my Smurfs home.

1046
01:00:56,279 --> 01:00:59,574
I won't ever give up. They're my family.

1047
01:01:00,075 --> 01:01:02,577
And you never give up on family.

1048
01:01:06,206 --> 01:01:09,251
Doesn't it freak you out sometimes,

1049
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,129
having all those little guys
depending on you?

1050
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:16,883
I mean, what if you screw up?

1051
01:01:17,884 --> 01:01:19,803
How'd you know when you were ready?

1052
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,472
Here. Come sit on Papa's lap.

1053
01:01:24,724 --> 01:01:26,852
Yeah, right. Scratch that.

1054
01:01:26,935 --> 01:01:29,604
- Probably not the best idea.
- Yeah, yeah.

1055
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:31,147
Let me ask you something.

1056
01:01:31,773 --> 01:01:34,901
Why did you come for us today
when your Grace called?

1057
01:01:35,443 --> 01:01:38,446
She needed me. I could
hear it in her voice.

1058
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:42,868
Well, that's what being a papa is.

1059
01:01:42,951 --> 01:01:45,453
When it comes time, you just do.

1060
01:01:46,913 --> 01:01:50,166
And knowing what to do
doesn't come from up here.

1061
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:57,299
It comes from here, where it matters most.

1062
01:01:58,508 --> 01:02:00,093
My spleen?

1063
01:02:00,176 --> 01:02:02,470
No, your heart.

1064
01:02:02,596 --> 01:02:06,975
I'm trying to have a moment here,
you whippersnapper.

1065
01:02:10,979 --> 01:02:14,816
- You're a good papa, Papa.
- And you'll be a good one, too.

1066
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:34,920
Come on, what you doing, man?
Get that weight off there.

1067
01:02:35,003 --> 01:02:37,297
Come on, baby, stop playing.

1068
01:02:38,673 --> 01:02:41,801
Come on, you silly moth.
Where are my eagles?

1069
01:02:42,844 --> 01:02:45,013
You know what happens to people
who sit on my bench?

1070
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:46,973
Be gone with you, behemoth,

1071
01:02:47,515 --> 01:02:51,853
for I have instructed a moth
to summon forth a gaggle of noble eagles

1072
01:02:51,978 --> 01:02:53,688
to free me from this confine.

1073
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:56,024
- Get up, Grandpa!
- Hey.

1074
01:02:57,025 --> 01:02:58,944
You see? You see?

1075
01:02:59,027 --> 01:03:02,530
The dungeon isn't built that can hold
the likes of Gargamel.

1076
01:03:02,656 --> 01:03:07,994
Behold my glorious army of... Flies?

1077
01:03:08,078 --> 01:03:10,747
- Flies? I said "to fly." "Fly."
- What is this?

1078
01:03:10,872 --> 01:03:14,542
Not "flies," you light-loving moron.

1079
01:03:15,502 --> 01:03:17,712
All right, up, up, up, bother it all.

1080
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:21,257
Up! Up, you inglorious devils!

1081
01:03:21,383 --> 01:03:23,551
So long, scallywags!

1082
01:03:26,262 --> 01:03:29,808
Well, don't do it again.
Go around it, go around!

1083
01:03:29,891 --> 01:03:33,228
- Oh, that's nasty.
- Go around it. Stupid flies.

1084
01:03:33,436 --> 01:03:34,688
Wait, take me with you!

1085
01:03:34,771 --> 01:03:36,856
Wait! Wait!

1086
01:03:40,777 --> 01:03:43,363
To my castle for more essence!

1087
01:03:54,457 --> 01:03:55,959
Here they come, here they come.

1088
01:03:59,421 --> 01:04:02,215
- Pretty smurf y, if I do say so myself.
- Yeah.

1089
01:04:02,298 --> 01:04:05,301
Come on, Elway, right over here.
Good boy. Thank you very much.

1090
01:04:05,427 --> 01:04:07,262
- Oh, my goodness.
- Here we go.

1091
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:10,390
- There we are.
- Clumsy.

1092
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:13,977
- Blue thumbs.
- This is unbelievable.

1093
01:04:14,102 --> 01:04:15,478
I think there's too much pink.

1094
01:04:15,603 --> 01:04:18,982
Just because your name is Grouchy
doesn't mean you always have to be grouchy.

1095
01:04:19,107 --> 01:04:20,400
Yeah, it does.

1096
01:04:20,483 --> 01:04:21,860
- Smurfette.
- Hi.

1097
01:04:21,943 --> 01:04:25,363
- High five. High four.
- High four.

1098
01:04:25,447 --> 01:04:30,994
Great news! The stars have revealed
a perfect time to smurf the blue moon.

1099
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,873
- We're going home! Yay!
- I knew you'd do it, Papa!

1100
01:04:34,956 --> 01:04:36,708
- All right!
- Smurftastic!

1101
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:38,376
I never doubted it for a second.

1102
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:42,505
It has to be done tonight,
between first star and high moon.

1103
01:04:42,672 --> 01:04:44,549
That's our only chance.

1104
01:04:44,632 --> 01:04:47,635
But we'll need a magic spell
that works in this realm

1105
01:04:47,761 --> 01:04:49,721
to open the portal home.

1106
01:04:49,804 --> 01:04:52,974
- Master Winslow, a question, please.
- Yeah, shoot.

1107
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:55,351
Is there a place that sells spells?

1108
01:04:55,477 --> 01:04:56,686
No.

1109
01:04:56,811 --> 01:05:00,273
- Is there a place that proffers potions?
- Yeah, no.

1110
01:05:00,648 --> 01:05:02,650
How about old books?

1111
01:05:02,984 --> 01:05:05,403
Wait, there's an antique book shop
right near where I work.

1112
01:05:05,487 --> 01:05:07,363
- Yes. Dr. Wong's. Yeah.
- Dr. Wong's something.

1113
01:05:07,489 --> 01:05:11,117
- Perfect. That'll do.
- Oh, hear that, boys? We're almost home.

1114
01:05:11,201 --> 01:05:13,119
- Yeah!
- I love being almost home.

1115
01:05:13,203 --> 01:05:15,205
Hey! Smurf hug!

1116
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:18,666
Oh, I love you guys!

1117
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:20,251
Bring it in, big fella.

1118
01:05:20,335 --> 01:05:21,920
- I wouldn't...
- Come on, we know you want to.

1119
01:05:22,003 --> 01:05:23,171
- Yes.
- Yeah, come on, Patrick.

1120
01:05:23,296 --> 01:05:24,672
- If I can do it, you can do it.
- Go on, big fella.

1121
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:26,257
- Here he comes!
- Smurf hug!

1122
01:05:26,341 --> 01:05:28,510
- We're goin' home!
- Hey there.

1123
01:05:35,183 --> 01:05:36,893
Hey, get up here.

1124
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,776
- That's it, laddie. Nice one.
- What's that?

1125
01:05:44,859 --> 01:05:47,028
Yeah. All of ya. All of ya!

1126
01:05:47,362 --> 01:05:50,198
Oh, look!
We don't have to make a blue moon.

1127
01:05:50,323 --> 01:05:52,033
We've already got one.

1128
01:05:52,242 --> 01:05:53,618
- Really?
- What?

1129
01:05:53,701 --> 01:05:56,704
- Look, guys, right over there.
- No, it isn't.

1130
01:05:56,871 --> 01:05:59,415
It is. Smurfette's right.
Look at the blue moon.

1131
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:04,212
That's the wrong ad.

1132
01:06:14,722 --> 01:06:15,890
What happened to my office?

1133
01:06:16,099 --> 01:06:19,227
We fixed it for the baby.
Another smurf hug!

1134
01:06:19,352 --> 01:06:23,064
No. No, no, no. This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

1135
01:06:24,941 --> 01:06:26,943
Someone sent this
to the ad agency last night.

1136
01:06:27,068 --> 01:06:28,653
- Who messed with my computer?
- I dunno.

1137
01:06:28,736 --> 01:06:31,531
- None of my Smurfs would...
- Wasn't me.

1138
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:39,789
I mighta, sorta, tripped.

1139
01:06:39,914 --> 01:06:42,417
Yeah, well, you mighta, sorta,
just got me fired.

1140
01:06:42,709 --> 01:06:44,460
You sent the wrong file.

1141
01:06:44,586 --> 01:06:47,088
- Patrick, it was just an accident.
- What am I supposed to do, Grace?

1142
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:49,716
You said that they would bring good luck.
This is anything but good.

1143
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:52,260
I never should've let this happen.
I should've said no.

1144
01:06:52,385 --> 01:06:56,306
I never wanted a house
full of little people running around!

1145
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:01,895
Blue. Little blue...

1146
01:07:02,103 --> 01:07:03,271
Okay...

1147
01:07:04,439 --> 01:07:05,607
Patrick.

1148
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:08,943
What are you doing?

1149
01:07:09,068 --> 01:07:10,778
Going to try to save my job.

1150
01:07:10,904 --> 01:07:13,740
We never intended to be a burden,
Master Winslow.

1151
01:07:13,823 --> 01:07:15,700
I'm smurfilly sorry about what I...

1152
01:07:15,783 --> 01:07:19,829
Stop saying "smurf" for everything.
What does that even mean? Smurf!

1153
01:07:20,246 --> 01:07:21,581
Smurfitty-smurf-smurf-smurf!

1154
01:07:21,664 --> 01:07:25,084
There's no call
for that kind of language, laddie.

1155
01:07:25,251 --> 01:07:26,294
See?

1156
01:07:26,794 --> 01:07:28,171
Okay, Patrick, wait.

1157
01:07:29,505 --> 01:07:31,257
- Hey, hey!
- Will you...

1158
01:07:31,341 --> 01:07:33,092
- Wait, Patrick.
- Maybe I can try to fix it.

1159
01:07:33,176 --> 01:07:34,510
Just stop and listen to me
for a second, please.

1160
01:07:34,636 --> 01:07:37,513
- What?
- Look, I'm really sorry about your job, okay?

1161
01:07:37,639 --> 01:07:39,641
And I hope that you can
straighten that out.

1162
01:07:39,766 --> 01:07:42,143
But you are so not seeing
the big picture here.

1163
01:07:42,977 --> 01:07:46,481
I mean, look around.
Look what's happening right now.

1164
01:07:46,648 --> 01:07:47,815
Of all the people on the planet,

1165
01:07:47,941 --> 01:07:50,318
those magical little creatures came to us.

1166
01:07:50,443 --> 01:07:52,111
They chose us.

1167
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:56,366
Don't you see
how absolutely amazing that is?

1168
01:07:56,658 --> 01:07:58,910
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
thing, Patrick.

1169
01:07:58,993 --> 01:08:00,995
This is our blue moon.

1170
01:08:02,538 --> 01:08:05,833
And if you don't stop
for just a second to see that,

1171
01:08:06,042 --> 01:08:07,502
you're gonna miss it.

1172
01:08:15,843 --> 01:08:17,470
Hey, hey. Taxi!

1173
01:08:18,388 --> 01:08:21,391
Come on! Come on! Blast. Blast you!

1174
01:08:21,683 --> 01:08:24,811
There's got to be some essence
in here somewhere!

1175
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,813
Not now.

1176
01:08:27,063 --> 01:08:28,523
What? What?

1177
01:08:33,695 --> 01:08:37,365
Very, very well done, my little friend.

1178
01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:41,494
And to think, I almost ate you that time.

1179
01:08:43,037 --> 01:08:47,583
Come, Azrael. We must find this Patrick,
the rouge merchant.

1180
01:08:47,834 --> 01:08:51,170
He will lead us to our
elusive little blue quarry.

1181
01:08:51,421 --> 01:08:55,216
Don't you just have a switch or something
to shut them off?

1182
01:08:55,341 --> 01:08:57,135
Tomorrow? Are you kidding me?

1183
01:08:57,218 --> 01:09:00,888
Ron, Ron. If I don't get those ads
down now, I don't have a job tomorrow.

1184
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:35,423
Smurf me.

1185
01:10:23,846 --> 01:10:25,515
Which way to the bookstore, Brainy?

1186
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:26,682
According to the searching device,

1187
01:10:26,808 --> 01:10:28,976
we take the F machine
two dots past the red circle to Chinaland.

1188
01:10:29,102 --> 01:10:31,354
- Look out, Brainy.
- "Chinatown," birdbrain.

1189
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:32,647
- Smurftito, smurftato.
- Here it is.

1190
01:10:32,772 --> 01:10:33,815
- Come on, everybody.
- Let's go, let's go.

1191
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:35,691
- Mind the gap.
- Wait? Are we sure about this?

1192
01:10:35,817 --> 01:10:37,026
- What?
- Jump!

1193
01:10:37,151 --> 01:10:38,945
- Oh, my.
- Not happy.

1194
01:10:40,863 --> 01:10:43,324
Come on, Brainy. Let's poke
around this great steel carriage.

1195
01:10:43,449 --> 01:10:45,660
- Is it safe?
- Of course it is.

1196
01:10:49,038 --> 01:10:50,665
That was great.

1197
01:10:51,666 --> 01:10:54,377
I hope we find this place soon.
I can't see out of this...

1198
01:10:56,337 --> 01:10:57,547
For smurf's sake.

1199
01:10:57,672 --> 01:10:59,841
I thought that's why we left Clumsy behind.

1200
01:10:59,966 --> 01:11:01,217
Oh, it smells like butter in here.

1201
01:11:01,342 --> 01:11:03,219
Where do you suppose
this magic bookstore could be?

1202
01:11:03,344 --> 01:11:05,012
- Wait a minute.
- There it is.

1203
01:11:05,221 --> 01:11:06,514
- It's closed.
- Figures.

1204
01:11:06,722 --> 01:11:09,016
We have to find a way in. Come on.

1205
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:17,400
I'm gettin' too old for this.

1206
01:11:18,526 --> 01:11:19,735
- Brainy.
- Gutsy.

1207
01:11:19,861 --> 01:11:21,028
All right, everybody.

1208
01:11:21,154 --> 01:11:22,238
- Hey.
- Wow.

1209
01:11:22,363 --> 01:11:23,406
This place looks creepy to me.

1210
01:11:23,531 --> 01:11:25,324
It's not creepy, it's different.
And I like it.

1211
01:11:25,408 --> 01:11:27,702
Let's just get the book
and get outta here.

1212
01:11:27,827 --> 01:11:31,247
You're right. This book of spells
is our ticket home.

1213
01:11:33,207 --> 01:11:38,421
I am but a simple wizard with a simple
desire, limitless power and world adulation.

1214
01:11:38,588 --> 01:11:41,674
Now why does it have to be so hard?

1215
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:51,058
Pardon me. Please, wise sir.
Wise sir. Please, please.

1216
01:11:51,184 --> 01:11:53,728
Wherever did you hear
that ear-damning squall?

1217
01:11:53,853 --> 01:11:54,979
It's your little blue men.

1218
01:11:55,062 --> 01:11:57,398
I saw them going into the bookstore
around the corner.

1219
01:11:59,901 --> 01:12:02,236
You know, that song is really annoying.

1220
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:05,531
Cautiously excited.

1221
01:12:07,116 --> 01:12:10,036
That's not it. That's not it.
Hey! Oh, no, that's not it.

1222
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:12,788
Look at all these amazing books.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

1223
01:12:12,914 --> 01:12:15,416
No, this isn't it.
You see anything, Smurfette?

1224
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:18,920
Nothin' up here, guys. Look out below!

1225
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:22,715
- I've got somethin', lads.
- Great job, Gutsy.

1226
01:12:22,798 --> 01:12:24,717
Oh. Nearly there.

1227
01:12:25,426 --> 01:12:30,640
- Well done.
- Just a minute. That's it. There we go.

1228
01:12:30,765 --> 01:12:31,974
Ah, yes.

1229
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:34,393
"L'Histoire des Schtroumpfs."

1230
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:36,771
Peyo.

1231
01:12:39,232 --> 01:12:41,400
- That's us.
- Yes, this is the one.

1232
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:45,279
- Look at that.
- Wow.

1233
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:47,073
Well, I'll be smurf ed.

1234
01:12:47,573 --> 01:12:50,159
The secret runes are hidden in the drawing.

1235
01:12:50,284 --> 01:12:51,827
You see all that in there?

1236
01:12:51,953 --> 01:12:54,622
Look here, at the patterns on this page.

1237
01:13:00,503 --> 01:13:02,505
Openous-lockicuss.

1238
01:13:09,595 --> 01:13:10,972
What?

1239
01:13:16,644 --> 01:13:21,315
You're right, Azrael.
This does have "me" written all over it.

1240
01:13:29,156 --> 01:13:32,118
Oh, that's just plain naughty.

1241
01:13:32,493 --> 01:13:37,623
All that remains now is to return to the
waterfall and invoke this spell, tonight.

1242
01:13:37,707 --> 01:13:40,334
- And we can go home?
- And we can go home.

1243
01:13:40,459 --> 01:13:42,545
- Oh, you're going home, all right.
- No.

1244
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:46,632
To a little place I like to call
BellVeedaRay Castle,

1245
01:13:47,008 --> 01:13:50,720
where your essence shall finally be mine.

1246
01:13:51,345 --> 01:13:53,139
- The dragon wand.
- No!

1247
01:13:53,222 --> 01:13:54,348
It's...

1248
01:13:54,473 --> 01:13:56,225
Oh, please, please, allow me.

1249
01:13:57,727 --> 01:14:00,062
- It's Gargamel!
- Run, Smurfs!

1250
01:14:00,646 --> 01:14:02,023
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Go, go, go!

1251
01:14:02,148 --> 01:14:03,232
Wait for me!

1252
01:14:03,357 --> 01:14:05,401
- To the door!
- Smurfentine! Smurfentine!

1253
01:14:05,526 --> 01:14:07,445
- Hurry!
- Yes, yes, do resist, little Smurfs.

1254
01:14:07,528 --> 01:14:08,696
After all,

1255
01:14:08,821 --> 01:14:11,699
what is the hunt without the thrill!

1256
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:17,038
No!

1257
01:14:25,838 --> 01:14:27,173
- We gotta go! Move!
- Run!

1258
01:14:27,256 --> 01:14:28,883
- Get goin', Smurfs!
- Faster, faster.

1259
01:14:29,008 --> 01:14:30,051
Let's get outta here.

1260
01:14:30,176 --> 01:14:33,888
Brainy, take the spell, brew the potion
and smurf the moon tonight.

1261
01:14:34,305 --> 01:14:35,473
It has to be tonight.

1262
01:14:35,556 --> 01:14:37,141
Me? Smurf the moon?

1263
01:14:37,224 --> 01:14:39,393
- No, no, I'm not ready.
- You have to be.

1264
01:14:40,645 --> 01:14:43,147
- Go. And no matter what happens...
- Papa?

1265
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:44,815
- ...do not come back for me.
- What?

1266
01:14:44,899 --> 01:14:46,150
- Papa, no!
- No!

1267
01:14:46,233 --> 01:14:48,569
- Papa!
- What are you waiting for, Gargamel?

1268
01:14:48,653 --> 01:14:51,072
Come to papa, Papa!

1269
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,575
- Just go!
- Papa!

1270
01:14:54,659 --> 01:14:55,993
- Papa!
- No!

1271
01:14:56,077 --> 01:14:57,578
Keep movin', lass.

1272
01:14:57,745 --> 01:15:00,414
- Do as Papa said.
- Papa!

1273
01:15:00,998 --> 01:15:04,168
Is that all that you've got, Gargamel?

1274
01:15:16,347 --> 01:15:18,015
What's gonna happen to Papa?

1275
01:15:18,099 --> 01:15:22,103
Papa told us to smurf the moon,
and that's exactly what we're gonna do.

1276
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,188
Come on. We don't have much time.

1277
01:15:24,397 --> 01:15:25,690
"Come on"? Come on, where?

1278
01:15:25,773 --> 01:15:28,067
How are we gonna get back to Clumsy?

1279
01:15:30,361 --> 01:15:32,738
We ride. Come on!

1280
01:15:33,781 --> 01:15:36,409
- Be still, bird.
- I don't think they're friendly.

1281
01:15:36,534 --> 01:15:38,619
- Well, neither am I.
- But they carry disease.

1282
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:41,789
And Smurfs. Let's ride.

1283
01:15:41,914 --> 01:15:43,624
- Whoa, bird, whoa!
- Come on!

1284
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:45,710
But I'm not sure I can do this.

1285
01:15:46,919 --> 01:15:49,296
You can do it, Brainy. Hold on!

1286
01:15:49,964 --> 01:15:53,217
According to my calculations,
this is dangerous!

1287
01:15:55,594 --> 01:15:57,221
It's getting dark.

1288
01:15:57,304 --> 01:16:00,224
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we'd better go look for them.

1289
01:16:00,307 --> 01:16:01,642
Yeah.

1290
01:16:05,146 --> 01:16:06,605
Hi.

1291
01:16:10,818 --> 01:16:14,780
- Where are the others?
- We think they're still at the bookstore.

1292
01:16:15,448 --> 01:16:18,117
Listen, Grace, I'm...

1293
01:16:23,497 --> 01:16:24,665
Hey, Odile.

1294
01:16:24,832 --> 01:16:27,168
Patrick...

1295
01:16:29,128 --> 01:16:31,422
Listen, listen. Before you fire me,

1296
01:16:31,505 --> 01:16:35,009
I know that the ads that ran
weren't the ads I sent.

1297
01:16:36,302 --> 01:16:39,513
But they're the ads I should have sent.

1298
01:16:40,347 --> 01:16:42,516
The ads I almost did send.

1299
01:16:42,933 --> 01:16:45,311
But I didn't 'cause...

1300
01:16:46,854 --> 01:16:48,272
I second-guessed myself.

1301
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:54,445
I gave you what I thought you wanted,
instead of what I thought was right.

1302
01:16:56,697 --> 01:16:59,116
But this is right.

1303
01:16:59,533 --> 01:17:02,286
It means something to me and...
I don't know,

1304
01:17:02,369 --> 01:17:04,538
I think it's gonna mean
something to others, too.

1305
01:17:06,332 --> 01:17:11,545
It's not just a moon,
Odile, it's a blue moon.

1306
01:17:12,379 --> 01:17:14,548
"Once in a blue moon."

1307
01:17:15,549 --> 01:17:20,221
That means that there are
only a few moments in your life

1308
01:17:20,387 --> 01:17:27,228
when something truly memorable,
truly magical, happens to you.

1309
01:17:28,521 --> 01:17:34,235
And, if you hesitate, if you're afraid,

1310
01:17:35,736 --> 01:17:37,321
you might just miss it.

1311
01:17:38,739 --> 01:17:41,075
That's what that image means.

1312
01:17:42,201 --> 01:17:46,205
Don't let those blue moon moments
pass you by.

1313
01:17:49,416 --> 01:17:52,753
I will call you back to
tell you if you're fired.

1314
01:17:58,551 --> 01:18:00,761
I so smurfin' love you.

1315
01:18:03,681 --> 01:18:06,350
Left-left, right! Right-right, bird!

1316
01:18:06,433 --> 01:18:08,894
- Brace for impact!
- The window's open, ya ninny.

1317
01:18:10,521 --> 01:18:12,189
We're outta control!

1318
01:18:12,565 --> 01:18:14,900
Whoa, bird! Watch out for the...

1319
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:17,695
- That'll do, pigeon.
- Thank you, bird.

1320
01:18:17,778 --> 01:18:19,613
Look! We got the incantation.

1321
01:18:19,738 --> 01:18:21,782
- Where's Papa?
- Gargamel's got him.

1322
01:18:21,949 --> 01:18:23,951
- What?
- Oh, no.

1323
01:18:24,118 --> 01:18:27,621
He took him to some place
called BellVeedaRay Castle.

1324
01:18:27,788 --> 01:18:30,624
- He's gonna...
- Don't say it.

1325
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:32,960
BellVeedaRay. What is BellVeedaRay?

1326
01:18:33,043 --> 01:18:36,046
Belve... He's taken him
to Belvedere Castle in Central Park.

1327
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:37,965
To extract his essence.

1328
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:40,050
- What? Well, we have to go get him.
- Yeah.

1329
01:18:40,134 --> 01:18:42,303
No! Gargamel's more powerful than ever.

1330
01:18:42,428 --> 01:18:45,431
Papa said no matter what happens
we're not to go back for him.

1331
01:18:45,598 --> 01:18:46,974
He's trying to protect us.

1332
01:18:47,099 --> 01:18:50,603
- No! We can't leave Papa behind.
- It was a Smurf promise.

1333
01:18:50,728 --> 01:18:52,062
No, no, no. We can't.

1334
01:18:52,146 --> 01:18:55,149
We promised Papa
we'd do exactly what he said.

1335
01:18:55,232 --> 01:18:57,067
- That's right.
- I didn't.

1336
01:18:58,944 --> 01:19:00,821
I never promised him anything.

1337
01:19:01,071 --> 01:19:04,992
Neither did I. And there is no way
I'm leaving here without Papa.

1338
01:19:06,994 --> 01:19:09,580
Patrick, wait. I'm coming with you.

1339
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:14,460
I'm in.

1340
01:19:18,172 --> 01:19:19,965
Aye. Me, too.

1341
01:19:22,134 --> 01:19:26,263
No Smurf left behind!
Not Papa, and not you.

1342
01:19:27,181 --> 01:19:30,184
- All for one and one for Smurf!
- All for one and one for Smurf!

1343
01:19:35,522 --> 01:19:38,442
I'll squeeze a few
And tweeze a few

1344
01:19:38,525 --> 01:19:41,028
And steal their essence blue

1345
01:19:44,198 --> 01:19:48,035
Very impressive, my dear,
sweet little Papa!

1346
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,624
Oh, look at this.

1347
01:19:54,208 --> 01:20:01,173
Just a tiny little bit of your little
tiny beard yields me all of this essence.

1348
01:20:02,049 --> 01:20:07,888
Just imagine what I'll be able to harvest
from your entire family of Smurfs.

1349
01:20:08,389 --> 01:20:10,140
Alakazookas!

1350
01:20:13,143 --> 01:20:17,398
Behold my glorious Smurf magic machine!

1351
01:20:21,235 --> 01:20:25,030
No. No! The cages! No! No!

1352
01:20:26,073 --> 01:20:29,702
I'll steam the essence from their sweat.
I'll tug it from their tears!

1353
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:31,996
I'll snip it from their hair.

1354
01:20:33,247 --> 01:20:35,332
You're a fool, Gargamel.

1355
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:38,419
My Smurfs are well on their way home
by now.

1356
01:21:03,777 --> 01:21:06,363
Oh, yeah. Let's light this candle.

1357
01:21:12,619 --> 01:21:14,288
Good luck, Gutsy!

1358
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:18,584
- Into the breach!
- I'll see you there!

1359
01:21:29,136 --> 01:21:32,931
- We all remember the plan, right?
- Let's get our smurf on.

1360
01:21:33,432 --> 01:21:34,641
Brainy, what's happening?

1361
01:21:34,975 --> 01:21:38,771
I've added the ingredients.
It's more powerful than anticipated.

1362
01:21:38,896 --> 01:21:40,314
I don't think I can do it.

1363
01:21:40,439 --> 01:21:44,109
Okay, Brainy, you can do this.
Just say the incantation.

1364
01:22:01,085 --> 01:22:02,461
I'll be smurf ed!

1365
01:22:03,754 --> 01:22:07,591
I did it. I did it, Papa! I did it!

1366
01:22:11,095 --> 01:22:13,597
- I don't believe it!
- Wow.

1367
01:22:14,014 --> 01:22:16,642
- It's the Anjelou moon.
- How did she do that?

1368
01:22:17,267 --> 01:22:19,436
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, Odile.

1369
01:22:19,937 --> 01:22:22,523
- Oh, wow.
- That's wonderful.

1370
01:22:30,864 --> 01:22:33,117
Now, I don't want you to worry, Papa.

1371
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:36,703
That which doesn't kill you
only makes me stronger.

1372
01:22:38,705 --> 01:22:40,290
- Yo!
- Huh?

1373
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:43,043
Gargamel! Come out and play!

1374
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:46,839
Oh, I think our tiny little guests
have finally arrived.

1375
01:22:47,172 --> 01:22:48,465
- No!
- Ah, well.

1376
01:22:48,549 --> 01:22:51,009
Enjoy the ride, Papa!

1377
01:22:52,678 --> 01:22:54,638
And remember, keep your hands and feet

1378
01:22:54,721 --> 01:22:57,808
- inside the cart at all times.
- No. No! No!

1379
01:22:57,891 --> 01:22:59,726
Smurfs, run!

1380
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,230
Smurfs.

1381
01:23:08,819 --> 01:23:12,573
You have our Papa. Prepare to get smurf ed!

1382
01:23:12,739 --> 01:23:14,408
Yeah, what he said.

1383
01:23:14,491 --> 01:23:15,993
Adorable.

1384
01:23:16,076 --> 01:23:19,746
Two little smurfs come to save
their beloved Papa.

1385
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:21,582
Hey, Gargamel.

1386
01:23:22,249 --> 01:23:25,002
Make that three little smurfs.

1387
01:23:29,089 --> 01:23:32,009
And I went home and got a few friends.

1388
01:23:53,113 --> 01:23:54,615
My, my, my!

1389
01:23:55,449 --> 01:23:57,117
I think the whole village must be here.

1390
01:23:58,577 --> 01:24:03,207
Whatever will I do with all this essence?

1391
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:05,125
On me, boys.

1392
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:07,794
Fire!

1393
01:24:07,878 --> 01:24:10,214
Let's get this hoedown started!

1394
01:24:10,797 --> 01:24:13,884
There comes a time
when every Smurf must stand up...

1395
01:24:13,967 --> 01:24:15,052
Watch it, you little hoodlums!

1396
01:24:15,135 --> 01:24:18,555
...for what is good and cute and blue
in the world.

1397
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:22,392
And on this brisk New York night,
that time is now.

1398
01:24:22,476 --> 01:24:24,144
Hey! Seriously?

1399
01:24:24,228 --> 01:24:26,647
Sorry, it's kind of what I do.

1400
01:24:29,608 --> 01:24:31,109
Eat yolk, Gargamel!

1401
01:24:34,071 --> 01:24:35,656
Patrick, can you do it?

1402
01:24:35,739 --> 01:24:36,782
Go, go, go!

1403
01:24:37,157 --> 01:24:38,492
Hurry, they can't hold out for long.

1404
01:24:40,661 --> 01:24:45,332
You know, one bad apple
can ruin your whole day.

1405
01:24:47,918 --> 01:24:49,670
Full smurf ahead!

1406
01:24:49,962 --> 01:24:51,338
Come on!

1407
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:56,510
Hey, Gargamel, here's a little
souvenir from the Big Apple.

1408
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:02,516
- Out of the frying pan...
- And into the...

1409
01:25:02,766 --> 01:25:03,767
- Fire.
- Fire.

1410
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:05,686
I'm too beautiful to die!

1411
01:25:15,988 --> 01:25:17,030
Oh, Papa.

1412
01:25:17,239 --> 01:25:19,074
No. No, Smurfette.

1413
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,076
What did he do to you?

1414
01:25:21,201 --> 01:25:22,286
You shouldn't have come back for me.

1415
01:25:22,369 --> 01:25:24,371
Papa, I'm getting you
out of here right now.

1416
01:25:28,917 --> 01:25:29,960
Smurfette!

1417
01:25:30,043 --> 01:25:32,045
Hang on, Papa, I'll be back.

1418
01:25:35,549 --> 01:25:36,842
Charge!

1419
01:25:36,925 --> 01:25:37,968
Get him!

1420
01:25:38,051 --> 01:25:39,136
Grab the wand!

1421
01:25:39,219 --> 01:25:40,429
- Goin' in!
- Go!

1422
01:25:43,765 --> 01:25:44,808
Bombs away!

1423
01:25:44,891 --> 01:25:47,352
- I'm going for a strike!
- Alakazam!

1424
01:25:48,895 --> 01:25:50,564
- Crikey.
- Look out, Gutsy!

1425
01:25:51,898 --> 01:25:53,275
Oh, ya blinkin' flip!

1426
01:25:56,611 --> 01:25:57,779
Hang on, Papa.

1427
01:26:01,408 --> 01:26:02,451
Onions!

1428
01:26:04,911 --> 01:26:06,079
Get back, cat.

1429
01:26:12,711 --> 01:26:13,962
Here, kitty, kitty...

1430
01:26:16,923 --> 01:26:18,091
Smurfette!

1431
01:26:20,802 --> 01:26:22,095
Looking for me?

1432
01:26:22,596 --> 01:26:24,097
Play time is over!

1433
01:26:24,598 --> 01:26:28,268
Behold the awesome power of me!

1434
01:26:42,783 --> 01:26:44,034
No!

1435
01:26:44,117 --> 01:26:47,329
Hold on! Help! Help! Help!

1436
01:26:58,006 --> 01:26:59,091
Smurfette?

1437
01:26:59,257 --> 01:27:00,801
Had enough, huh?

1438
01:27:01,134 --> 01:27:02,260
You're mine, kitty.

1439
01:27:06,098 --> 01:27:08,141
I'm done smurfing around.

1440
01:27:17,818 --> 01:27:19,986
You smurf ed with the wrong girl.

1441
01:27:24,199 --> 01:27:25,700
- I got you, Greedy.
- Oh, my cupcake!

1442
01:27:29,663 --> 01:27:31,123
What's happening, Papa?

1443
01:27:31,456 --> 01:27:32,499
No!

1444
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:36,336
Gargamel!

1445
01:27:37,337 --> 01:27:40,132
Not so fast, goody blue-shoes.

1446
01:27:40,632 --> 01:27:42,175
Oh, Papa!

1447
01:27:43,677 --> 01:27:47,180
Now, it's time to break
their little blue wills.

1448
01:27:47,681 --> 01:27:50,517
- No.
- Are you watching closely, Smurfs?

1449
01:27:50,809 --> 01:27:53,520
- Papa!
- Your beloved little Papa

1450
01:27:53,645 --> 01:27:56,982
is about to meet his little blue end.

1451
01:27:57,065 --> 01:27:58,108
No!

1452
01:27:58,191 --> 01:27:59,651
Upsy-daisy!

1453
01:27:59,818 --> 01:28:01,486
Oh, no. Papa!

1454
01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:02,654
Papa!

1455
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:09,744
No! No!

1456
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:10,912
You again!

1457
01:28:11,037 --> 01:28:12,205
Goodbye!

1458
01:28:13,248 --> 01:28:14,332
I'm really...

1459
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:17,836
This ends here, this ends now!

1460
01:28:17,919 --> 01:28:19,713
...really going to enjoy this.

1461
01:28:20,046 --> 01:28:21,214
Gotcha!

1462
01:28:21,673 --> 01:28:23,258
Freedom!

1463
01:28:23,383 --> 01:28:24,885
Son of a smurf!

1464
01:28:25,093 --> 01:28:26,428
Come back here!

1465
01:28:26,553 --> 01:28:28,680
Go, Gutsy! Yeah!

1466
01:28:29,681 --> 01:28:32,434
Come back here right now with my wand!

1467
01:28:33,852 --> 01:28:35,896
Oh, no. Crikey.

1468
01:28:39,733 --> 01:28:41,902
I... I got it.

1469
01:28:42,235 --> 01:28:44,279
- Oh, dear.
- Clumsy.

1470
01:28:44,404 --> 01:28:47,782
- So this is how it ends.
- Our goose is cooked.

1471
01:28:50,452 --> 01:28:52,913
- This is not gonna be good.
- We're doomed.

1472
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:55,415
I got it! I got it!

1473
01:28:56,708 --> 01:28:59,419
The vision's never been wrong.

1474
01:29:09,763 --> 01:29:11,306
I... I...

1475
01:29:12,224 --> 01:29:13,558
I got it!

1476
01:29:15,435 --> 01:29:18,271
My wand! Give me back my wand!

1477
01:29:33,286 --> 01:29:34,621
How dare you!

1478
01:29:36,623 --> 01:29:40,585
How dare you defy the great and powerful...

1479
01:29:45,632 --> 01:29:46,675
Oh, my God.

1480
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,426
Smurfs!

1481
01:29:53,098 --> 01:29:54,683
Are you dead?

1482
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:01,523
- Nice one, Clumsy!
- Are you kidding me?

1483
01:30:01,648 --> 01:30:03,191
- Get up here, you!
- Yeah!

1484
01:30:03,984 --> 01:30:06,486
Bravo! Danke schön, Clumsy!

1485
01:30:07,195 --> 01:30:08,780
- Patrick.
- Hey.

1486
01:30:09,155 --> 01:30:12,659
Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy!

1487
01:30:15,453 --> 01:30:17,706
Clumsy, you're a hero.

1488
01:30:17,831 --> 01:30:18,999
I'm a hero?

1489
01:30:19,165 --> 01:30:20,333
Yeah. Yeah.

1490
01:30:20,834 --> 01:30:25,672
I'm a hero! I'm so sorry, guys.
Definitely killed the moment.

1491
01:30:26,339 --> 01:30:29,843
- Clumsy, you little mook, you.
- It's Papa.

1492
01:30:31,011 --> 01:30:33,346
I owe you an apology, Clumsy.

1493
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:37,017
I believed more in a
vision than I did in you.

1494
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:40,186
I'm so proud of you, Clumsy.

1495
01:30:40,478 --> 01:30:41,980
Thanks, Papa.

1496
01:30:42,814 --> 01:30:45,317
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

1497
01:30:45,567 --> 01:30:47,902
And now to get rid of this!

1498
01:30:53,408 --> 01:30:56,870
To the portal, everyone!
There's no time to spare.

1499
01:30:57,537 --> 01:30:59,664
- Smurf y'all later!
- Bye.

1500
01:31:02,042 --> 01:31:03,627
I'm not one for long goodbyes,

1501
01:31:03,710 --> 01:31:07,213
but I did smurf together a few words
I'd like to say.

1502
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:08,423
- Bye.
- Take care.

1503
01:31:08,548 --> 01:31:11,718
I hated this. So much less than I expected.

1504
01:31:12,052 --> 01:31:15,722
- Bye, Grouchy.
- Don't get me wrong, I still hated it. Just less.

1505
01:31:15,847 --> 01:31:21,019
I'll not soon forget this place.
Especially not with these! Tallyho!

1506
01:31:21,603 --> 01:31:24,397
I shall be back, Broadway. Tootles!

1507
01:31:24,522 --> 01:31:26,399
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Wow.

1508
01:31:27,025 --> 01:31:29,277
I've never had a girlfriend before.

1509
01:31:31,446 --> 01:31:34,783
- I'll never forget you.
- Smurfette.

1510
01:31:36,034 --> 01:31:37,077
High four.

1511
01:31:39,079 --> 01:31:40,872
High four, Grace.

1512
01:31:42,248 --> 01:31:44,084
- Hey, Smurfette.
- And you.

1513
01:31:44,209 --> 01:31:46,252
- Hi.
- You, the little hero, come here.

1514
01:31:46,878 --> 01:31:48,880
Hero? Stop.

1515
01:31:49,589 --> 01:31:51,925
Well, actually, you mind saying
it one more time?

1516
01:31:52,050 --> 01:31:53,593
It's kinda got a nice ring to it.

1517
01:31:59,265 --> 01:32:02,435
- Goodbye, Grace.
- Well, Master Winslow, thank you.

1518
01:32:03,103 --> 01:32:05,105
- You saved me.
- So long!

1519
01:32:05,647 --> 01:32:07,273
You saved my whole family.

1520
01:32:07,482 --> 01:32:10,610
Actually I think it was
the other way around.

1521
01:32:11,111 --> 01:32:15,115
Well, I should get going.
I've got a Smurf village to rebuild.

1522
01:32:15,448 --> 01:32:17,659
Your village has given me some ideas.

1523
01:32:18,952 --> 01:32:20,286
Come here.

1524
01:32:29,337 --> 01:32:30,880
Goodbye, Papa.

1525
01:32:31,631 --> 01:32:33,967
Goodbye, Papa.

1526
01:32:40,890 --> 01:32:42,475
Let's go home.

1527
01:32:45,645 --> 01:32:49,733
And so, the Smurfs left
the strange city of New York,

1528
01:32:50,316 --> 01:32:54,612
and I think they left it a little sweeter,
a little wiser,

1529
01:32:54,696 --> 01:32:56,906
a little smurfier.

1530
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:59,659
And as that portal began to close
for the last time...

1531
01:32:59,743 --> 01:33:01,911
Hey! Seriously, stop!

1532
01:33:02,912 --> 01:33:04,831
Bye, New York!

1533
01:33:14,674 --> 01:33:16,843
It's Odile. Hey, Odile.

1534
01:33:16,926 --> 01:33:19,345
Patrick, I just called to say thank you.

1535
01:33:20,555 --> 01:33:22,849
Finally someone has given me what I want.

1536
01:33:30,690 --> 01:33:31,858
I think I'm not fired.

1537
01:33:33,276 --> 01:33:34,360
Wow!

1538
01:33:38,364 --> 01:33:41,951
Wow. So that's a new job, new baby,

1539
01:33:43,536 --> 01:33:45,622
some unique new friends...

1540
01:33:50,418 --> 01:33:52,587
- You know if you really want a bigger place.
- Bigger?

1541
01:33:52,962 --> 01:33:55,965
Are you crazy? Then we'll be further apart.

1542
01:34:01,554 --> 01:34:02,597
Grace,

1543
01:34:05,892 --> 01:34:07,227
I smurf you.

1544
01:36:06,346 --> 01:36:08,556
Smurfs. Smurfs!

1545
01:36:13,186 --> 01:36:16,230
I wish I could quit you. Get out of here.

1546
01:36:19,943 --> 01:36:21,694
What are you looking at?
