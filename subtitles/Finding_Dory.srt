You have to go back to bed.</font>

106
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And remember, the anemone stings.</font>

Ready to start the day.</font>

113
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And we were looking for something.
- Nemo.</font>

114
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. I remember it
like it was yesterday.</font>

115
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, I don't really remember
yesterday all that well.</font>

116
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, I would say the scariest
moment of the trip was the 4 sharks.</font>

117
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, I thought
there were 3 sharks.</font>

118
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:03,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No,
there were definitely 4.</font>

119
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:05,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But last time you told it,
there were 3.</font>

120
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son, which one of us travelled
across the entire ocean?</font>

121
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nemo did.</font>

122
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:11,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obviously we had to cross the ocean...</font>

123
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to find him, so you know... He went first.</font>

124
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess that's true. Isn't it?</font>

125
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:23,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you made it!
You almost missed the field trip.</font>

126
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A field trip? Ooh, I love field trips.
Where are we going?</font>

127
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I thought you told her.
- I did tell her!</font>

128
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh... Dory.
- Yeah.</font>

129
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:35,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Ray has too many fish
to keep an eye on today.</font>

130
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh.</font>

131
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:42,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it would be best if today
you weren't exactly with the class.</font>

132
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Why not?</font>

133
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you know, you have problems
remembering things sometimes.</font>

134
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the one thing I can remember.
Yes.</font>

135
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:53,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. And sometimes it's not your fault,
but it can cause you to wander.</font>

136
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:57,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Mr. Ray doesn't really have time
to worry about fish who wander.</font>

137
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In other words,
he doesn't have enough help.</font>

138
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Poor guy.
You know, he's so overworked.</font>

139
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:04,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You understand.
- I totally understand now.</font>

140
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:05,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

141
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wants me
to be the teacher's assistant.</font>

142
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... No, not exactly.</font>

143
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:12,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so honoured. I have never been
a teaching assistant before.</font>

144
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Ray! You got help.</font>

145
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Okeydokey.</font>

146
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right, kids.
- All right, kids.</font>

147
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Today's the day!
- Today's the day!</font>

148
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our field trip to the sting ray migration.</font>

149
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:29,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sting ray migration.</font>

150
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, does anyone know
why we migrate?</font>

151
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:35,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. You got to know this stuff.</font>

152
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:38,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Migration is about going back to...</font>

153
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bed!
- Yes!</font>

154
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:40,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- No.</font>

155
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:44,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The sand!
- No! Migration is about going home.</font>

156
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:46,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Home.
- Which is where you're from.</font>

157
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:46,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where you're from.</font>

158
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can someone tell me
where they're from?</font>

159
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:51,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I live by a giant rock.
- I live 3 coral caves away from here.</font>

160
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My house is covered in algae.</font>

161
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:54,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where'd you grow up, Dory?</font>

162
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me? Um, I don't know.</font>

163
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My family. Where are they?</font>

164
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I help you?</font>

165
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:10,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. Did I forget again?
You see, I suffer from...</font>

166
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Short-term memory loss.</font>

167
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:16,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you remember your family
if you have short-term memory loss?</font>

168
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good question. See, I can remember
some things because well...</font>

169
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They make sense.
Like, um, I have a family.</font>

170
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know because I've... I must have
come from somewhere. Right?</font>

171
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone has a family.</font>

172
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I may not remember their names
and what they look like.</font>

173
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:31,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I may not even be able to
ever find them again, but, um...</font>

174
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:34,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What were we talking about?
- Mommies and daddies.</font>

175
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommies and daddies. Right.</font>

176
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:40,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are we talking about
mommies and daddies? Oh. Oh!</font>

177
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:43,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That class. Uh-oh. Why me? Okay.</font>

178
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:46,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys seem a little young,
but, um, okay.</font>

179
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:49,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, kids,
when two fish love each other...</font>

180
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we'll stop right there.</font>

181
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Climb aboard, explorers.
I feel a migration song coming on.</font>

182
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:01,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

183

189
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:24,745

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody has to be careful of what?
Hmm?</font>

196
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The undertow!
That's right.</font>

198
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:49,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because the current created

you can get pulled into...</font>

200
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:54,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Ray! So how do the stingrays
all know where to go?</font>

201
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what an instinct is, Nemo.</font>

202
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:01,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something deep inside you that feels
so familiar that you have to listen to it.</font>

00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be fine, I just need to find
a way out and...</font>

389
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I could just... Get a hold of yourself,</font>

390
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">get a hold of yourself.</font>

391
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be fine, everything's fine,
think positively.</font>

392
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, you.
- Oh.</font>

393
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:32,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spinner.</font>

394
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:35,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thank goodness. Hi, I'm Dory. I'm...</font>

395
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:37,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Name's Hank. How sick are you?</font>

396
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:38,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sick? I'm sick?</font>

397
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why else would you be in quarantine?</font>

398
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh no! How long do I have?
I have to find my family.</font>

399
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Now don't get hysterical...
Uh-oh. Not good.</font>

400
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? What is it? What happened?
What's that?</font>

401
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That there is bad news.</font>

402
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a transport tag for fish
who can't cut it inside the institute.</font>

403
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:56,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They get transferred to permanent digs.
An aquarium.</font>

404
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:57,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In Cleveland.</font>

405
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fish in here, go back in the ocean.
Cleveland fish, stay there forever.</font>

406
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:05,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cleveland? No!
I can't go to the Cleveland.</font>

407
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to get to the Jewel of Morro Bay,
California and find my family.</font>

408
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's this place.
The Marine Life Institute.</font>

409
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.
You're here.</font>

410
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:15,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean I'm from here?</font>

411
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My parents are here.
I have to get to them.</font>

412
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what exhibit are you from?</font>

413
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. I'm from an exhibit?
Which one? I have to get there.</font>

414
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm. That's a hard one, kid.</font>

415
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:28,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless... Nah.
Never work. It's too crazy.</font>

416
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean? Just tell me.
I'm okay with crazy.</font>

417
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:34,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I could see that?
Well, there's one thing I can think of...</font>

418
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to help you get to your family.
If I just take...</font>

419
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Great idea.
You take me to find them.</font>

420
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:40,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't I think of that?</font>

421
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, no, no, no.
If I just take your tag...</font>

422
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can take your place on the transport
truck then you can go back inside...</font>

423
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and find your family.
All you have to do is give me the tag.</font>

424
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What tag?
There's a tag on my fin!</font>

425
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could you forget
you have a tag on your fin?</font>

426
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh no. I'm sorry. I...
I suffer from short-term memory loss.</font>

427
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't remember
what we were talking about?</font>

428
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-mm. Not a clue.
What were we talking about?</font>

429
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:07,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, you were about to give me your tag.</font>

430
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I kind of like my tag.
Why do you want it?</font>

431
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I can go to...</font>

432
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I can go to Cleveland.</font>

433
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:15,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cleveland? Mmm.
I hear good things</font>

434
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:16,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about Cleveland.
Why do you want to go?</font>

435
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:19,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because if I stay here I'm gonna get
released back to the ocean.</font>

436
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I have extremely
unpleasant memories of that place.</font>

437
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want to live in a glass box alone.</font>

438
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:28,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all I want. So give me your tag!</font>

439
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, man, don't touch my tag!</font>

440
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:33,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look...</font>

441
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:42,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't work here.
It's not like I have a map of this place.</font>

442
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:44,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A map! Good idea.</font>

443
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:47,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You take me to the map, I figure out
where my parents are. Oh boy.</font>

444
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:52,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. If I get you to your family
will you give me...</font>

445
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:55,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have much. Um, I...
How about if I give you this tag?</font>

446
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great idea.</font>

447
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you absolutely
sure that's what I said?</font>

448
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:09,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Go wait over there and forget.
That's what you do best."</font>

449
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, Dad.
- I said that?</font>

450
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said that, Dory swam to the surface,</font>

451
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she got taken by some...</font>

452
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I don't want to hear
the whole story again.</font>

453
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:18,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just asking about the one part
because, look, if I said that...</font>

454
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:22,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not positive I did.
It's actually a compliment because...</font>

455
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I asked her to wait and I said,
"It's what you do best."</font>

456
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:29,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I... Oh, it's my fault!</font>

457
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all my fault she got kidnapped
and taken into whatever this place is.</font>

458
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:34,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if it's a restaurant?</font>

459
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:37,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oy! You two! Shut it!</font>

460
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:41,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we're trying to sleep!
You interrupted my favourite dream!</font>

461
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that the one about you
laying on this rock?</font>

462
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Oh, that is a good one.</font>

463
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh yeah, isn't it? Yeah.
- It's one of my favourites.</font>

464
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:48,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, excuse us. Hello!</font>

465
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:49,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Son! Son.
- We're trying to...</font>

466
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are sea lions.
They are natural predators.</font>

467
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They could pounce at any moment.</font>

468
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, they don't look very pouncy.</font>

469
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:59,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what they want you to think.</font>

470
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:02,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get behind me
and let me do the talking.</font>

471
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:05,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, we're worried
about our friend. Is that a restaurant?</font>

472
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:10,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mate, it's not a restaurant.
Your friend is okay.</font>

473
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She is?
- It's a fish hospital.</font>

474
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:17,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sigourney Weaver says she'll be
rescued, rehabilitated, and released.</font>

475
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll be in and out in a jiff.
We should know.</font>

476
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nasal parasite.
- Anaemia.</font>

477
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:23,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All fixed up and sent on our way.</font>

478
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh thank goodness.</font>

479
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:28,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, that's all right.
Don't you worry ab...</font>

480
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Gerald, get off the rock!
- Shove off, Gerald! Come on. Off! Off!</font>

481
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get off! Now you know better! Off!
- Off! Off! Off! Off!</font>

482
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:40,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you worry about a thing.
That place is the Marine Life Institute.</font>

483
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.</font>

484
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:44,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was right.</font>

485
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:47,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like Dory
can do something besides forget.</font>

486
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Nemo. Thank you for that.</font>

487
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So how are we gonna get inside?</font>

488
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. You want to get inside MLI?</font>

489
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:55,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desperately. Our friend is in there.
Lost, alone.</font>

490
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's scared.
She'll have no idea what to do.</font>

491
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:01,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, we know a way.</font>

492
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:02,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do?</font>

493
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:05,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooo-roo.
Ooo-roo-roo. Ooo-roo.</font>

494
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are they doing?
- I don't know. It sounds bad.</font>

495
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we there yet?
Sh. Keep it down!</font>

496
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:15,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank, I'm so glad I found you.
It feels like... I... Destiny.</font>

497
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what must be the millionth time,
it's not destiny.</font>

498
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:20,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh. Have I said "destiny" before?
I'm sorry.</font>

499
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:23,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just so nervous
because I'm gonna meet my parents.</font>

500
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:25,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't seen them in I don't even know
how long because...</font>

501
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- you see I suffer from short-term...
- Short-term memory loss.</font>

502
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, no more talking. Okay?
I don't like talking.</font>

503
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like chatter and questions.
And, "How are you? Oh I'm fine."</font>

504
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:35,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"How are you? I'm fine too."
News flash -nobody's fine.</font>

505
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:36,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm fine. How are you?</font>

506
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hank, look, there's a map!
- Sh!</font>

507
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The plan is you're gonna read that
and figure out where your parents live.</font>

508
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:44,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I'm on the truck to Cleveland.
You got it?</font>

509
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it. What was the first part again?</font>

510
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh.</font>

511
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? The octopus escaped again?</font>

512
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:52,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Look at all the exhibits.</font>

513
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:54,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you do this park in one day?
Seriously.</font>

514
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pick one!
- Okay. Um...</font>

515
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well,
tell everyone to keep an eye out.</font>

516
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:02,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're supposed to be releasing
the octopus back to the ocean today.</font>

517
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, of course I haven't seen him.
If I was looking I'd find him.</font>

518
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank! There you are.</font>

519
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hurry up!
- Okay. Okay.</font>

520
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:16,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">K. It starts with a "k."
Kid z-own-y. Kid zone!</font>

521
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No kids. Kids grab things.</font>

522
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm not losing
another tentacle for you.</font>

523
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lost a tentacle?
Well then you're not an octopus,</font>

524
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:24,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're a septopus.</font>

525
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:26,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I may not remember, but I can count.</font>

526
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hurry up!
- Okay.</font>

527
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:31,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Journey to the... Hey, look. Shells.</font>

528
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, look. Shells!</font>

529
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy, here's a shell for you.</font>

530
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:41,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's great, Dory.
You found another one.</font>

531
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I did?
- Oh, yes, you did.</font>

532
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're getting good at this, Dory.</font>

533
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, look. Shells!</font>

534
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, I live there.
- Yes! Yes, indeed.</font>

535
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:57,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I like shells.
- That's right, dear.</font>

536
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think you could find me
another shell?</font>

537
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Purple ones
are my favourite.</font>

538
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Mommy.</font>

539
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy. Purple shell. Purple shell!
Hey, my home had a purple shell.</font>

540
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:16,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what? Half the exhibits here
have purple shells in them.</font>

541
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. You don't understand.
I remember her now.</font>

542
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Purple shells were her favourite
and she had this adorable giggle.</font>

543
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:22,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then my dad was really friendly.</font>

544
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now your wacky memory's
gonna get us caught.</font>

545
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still think this is destiny?</font>

546
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hank, we have to find my folks!
- Quiet!</font>

547
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh. Base, this is Carol.</font>

548
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:44,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, I think I might have found
that missing octopus. Over.</font>

549
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- See what you did?
- Sorry.</font>

550
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:48,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This could not be worse.</font>

551
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:52,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm. "Destiny." Destiny.</font>

552
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hank. I got a feeling.
- Sh!</font>

553
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we should get in the bucket.</font>

554
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:59,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No. Stop.
- Seriously. It says "destiny" and it is...</font>

555
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, no, no, no, no.
- We've got to get in that bucket.</font>

556
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:05,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm not going with you in that bucket.
- Here... I... go... in... the... bucket. Bye.</font>

557
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:12,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys, I'm looking for my family.
Oh, good idea. Play dead.</font>

558
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I got to blink. How do you
hold your eyes open that long?</font>

559
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys. Wait a second.</font>

560
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our next guest
has been here a very long time.</font>

561
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:50,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a whale shark.
Her name is Destiny.</font>

562
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Destiny? Really?</font>

563
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:55,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll notice she's extremely
near-sighted and has trouble...</font>

564
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">navigating her environment.
Oh! And here she comes now.</font>

565
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:03,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh! Destiny. You're a fish?</font>

566
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. What?</font>

567
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi! Hello there.
- Whoa! Oh. Whoa.</font>

568
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:12,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I'll go with you.</font>

569
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:17,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me.
- Is that blue blob talking?</font>

570
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can you help me? I lost my family.
- You lost your family?</font>

571
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's a long story,</font>

572
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and truth be told,
I don't remember most of it.</font>

573
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, that is so sad.
You poor thi...</font>

574
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:31,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. Not a great swimmer.
I can't see very well.</font>

575
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:33,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I think you swim beautifully.</font>

576
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, I've never seen a fish
swim like that before.</font>

577
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

578
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:39,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>

579
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:40,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. Say that again.</font>

580
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, you're welcome.</font>

581
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:45,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dory?
- Yes.</font>

582
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:46,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dory?
- Yes.</font>

583
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:47,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dory?
- Yes.</font>

584
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dory!
- Yes.</font>

585
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You and I were friends!
- No!</font>

586
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dory, it's me! Destiny!
- You know me?</font>

587
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:56,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course! We talked through the pipes
when we were little.</font>

588
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We were pipe pals!
- We were?</font>

589
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Aw, you're so pretty.
- So you know where I'm from?</font>

590
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:04,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep, you are from
the Open Ocean exhibit.</font>

591
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm from the Open Ocean exhibit?</font>

592
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then that's
where my parents are.</font>

593
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:09,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got to go. Can you take me there?</font>

594
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:11,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Kind of tough for a whale
to travel around here.</font>

595
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:15,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you please keep it down
over there? My head hurts.</font>

596
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:16,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's that?</font>

597
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:17,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my neighbour, Bailey.</font>

598
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was brought in with a head injury.</font>

599
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you're talking about me, Destiny.</font>

600
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He thinks he can't use his echolocation,
but I've overheard...</font>

601
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the doctors talking.
There's not a thing wrong with him.</font>

602
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hear every word
you're saying about me.</font>

603
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's echolocation?</font>

604
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:31,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bailey's head is supposed to put out
a call and the echo helps him...</font>

605
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:36,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">find objects far away.
Oh, but apparently he's still "healing."</font>

606
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I know you're talking about me.</font>

607
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I really can't echolocate.
- Oh.</font>

608
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot have this conversation again.
I just can't.</font>

609
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:45,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hit my head very hard out there.
See how swollen it is!</font>

610
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your head is supposed to be big!
You're a beluga!</font>

611
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Echolocation.</font>

612
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, like the world's
most powerful pair of glasses?</font>

613
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:53,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- What are glasses?</font>

614
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's sort of like you go, "hoo"</font>

615
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then you see things.
Why do I know that?</font>

616
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. That's interesting.</font>

617
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:06,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you are!
Listen up, you and I are square.</font>

618
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:08,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took you to the map,
now give me that tag!</font>

619
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:11,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, no. I know where my parents are.
They're in the...</font>

620
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:14,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's it called? The place...
The soap and lotion?</font>

621
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:15,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Open Ocean.
- Open Ocean!</font>

622
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:18,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open Ocean!
I know where that is.</font>

623
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the exhibit located right next to...
I don't care.</font>

624
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:22,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy!</font>

625
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:25,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're trying to get to the Open Ocean
exhibit go through the pipes.</font>

626
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:28,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Through the pipes. Great.
- Through the pipes?</font>

627
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep. Take two lefts, swim straight
and you'll hit it.</font>

628
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:34,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's a lot of directions. That's...
Did you get that, Hank? All that?</font>

629
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh, yeah.
- Great! Let's go.</font>

630
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:40,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going with you. I won't fit.
You have to go by yourself.</font>

631
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

632
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:49,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's... I'm... I... See, I can't because
I'm not so good with directions.</font>

633
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's too bad. A deal's a deal.
You wanted to find your parents?</font>

634
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how you get to them.
Now give me your tag.</font>

635
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, Hank, I can't go in the pipes alone.
I'll forget where I'm going.</font>

636
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not my problem. Tag!
- But I can't get in that way.</font>

637
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:03,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry, but there's no other way.
- There's no other way.</font>

638
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:08,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There's no other way.
- Now, now. Don't panic.</font>

639
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:13,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. Not everything in life is
easy to do. Isn't that right, Charlie?</font>

640
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:17,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's right. When something's
too hard, you should just give up.</font>

641
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Charlie!
- A joke. I'm kidding!</font>

642
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:23,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a joke. A joke.
Caution, joker at work.</font>

643
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:24,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joke. I got it.</font>

644
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:28,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, kelpcake?
There's always another way.</font>

645
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:31,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Daddy.</font>

646
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Daddy.</font>

647
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope. My father said
there's always another way.</font>

648
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:40,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What? There is no other way.
- Open Ocean. Open Ocean. Hmm...</font>

649
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:44,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open Ocean. I'm pretty sure
it's the building over there.</font>

650
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:47,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's ill-defined and roundish.
Like Bailey's head.</font>

651
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait, what?
- Always another way. There's...</font>

652
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:53,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There! Guys, follow me.
I know how we can get to locomotion.</font>

653
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:55,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open Ocean.
Exactly.</font>

654
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:59,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, guys.
You know I can't swim over there, right?</font>

655
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:03,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooo-roo, ooo-roo, ooo-roo.</font>

656
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:05,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't see how this
is going to get us inside.</font>

657
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:06,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you even doing?</font>

658
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're calling her over, of course.</font>

659
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:10,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calling her over? Calling who over?</font>

660
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:17,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lads, meet Becky.</font>

661
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:23,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flying? No, no, no new information.</font>

662
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, tell her thank you.</font>

663
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys have gone
above and beyond. Really.</font>

664
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:31,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But is there a way to get in
that involves, like, swimming?</font>

665
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because that's really our strength.</font>

666
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:36,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, your friend is going to be
in quarantine.</font>

667
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's where they take the sick fish.</font>

668
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:41,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the one and only one way
into that place is Becky.</font>

669
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Becky.</font>

670
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:49,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow! Stop. Let's call
her Pecky because this is hurting.</font>

671
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think she likes you, Dad.</font>

672
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:55,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky, love? These two nice fish
need to get into quarantine.</font>

673
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you free today, Rebecca darling?</font>

674
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:01,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky, is... Would that work
with your schedule? Ow!</font>

675
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She doesn't understand
what I'm saying.</font>

676
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All you have to do
is imprint with her, mate.</font>

677
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Imp... What?
- Imprint.</font>

678
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:12,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look her in the eye and say, "ooo-roo"
and she'll be in sync with you.</font>

679
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:15,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now look her in the eye.
- Yeah.</font>

680
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:19,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nemo, I think we should
devise an alternate plan.</font>

681
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:22,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One that involves staying in the water
and someone sane.</font>

682
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:25,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because this bird, this bird...
This ain't the bird!</font>

683
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's fine, Dad. And in the meantime,
Dory will just forget us.</font>

684
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like you said, it's what she does best.</font>

685
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

686
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:35,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

687
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:39,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, look her in the eye. Which eye?</font>

688
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:40,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just pick one, mate.</font>

689
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:42,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky.</font>

690
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

691
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:51,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh. Ooo-roo.
Roo-roo, Becky.</font>

692
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:57,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, this is all great.</font>

693
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:01,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How exactly is Becky
supposed to carry us?</font>

694
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh yeah. I almost forgot. Gerald!</font>

695
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hmm?
- Yeah, Gerald.</font>

696
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:08,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, son.
- Hmm?</font>

697
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Gerald. Give us your pail,
we'll let you sit on the rock.</font>

698
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, Gerald. We swear it.
- Hmm.</font>

699
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:21,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right. Shimmy on over here.</font>

700
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. You can do it.</font>

701
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

702
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:26,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind you don't scuff your bum.</font>

703
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:32,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you so much, Gerald.</font>

704
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:35,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to your time on this rock.</font>

705
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Comfortable, isn't it?</font>

706
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:40,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time's up! Get off!</font>

707
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:42,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Off! Off! Off! Off!
- Time's up! Now get off, Gerald! Off!</font>

708
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, this is nuts! Why do I keep getting
talked into insane choices?</font>

709
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:48,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck!</font>

710
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:54,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, when I tell you you're gonna...</font>

711
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I know. I'm gonna signal
with a big splash.</font>

712
00:37:57,109 --> 00:38:01,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On my mark. Not clear yet.
Not clear yet.</font>

713
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:04,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now?
- Not 'til Destiny gives the signal.</font>

714
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:09,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know something? I have no idea
why you're even doing this.</font>

715
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:11,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

716
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It seems like a lot of trouble
just to find some more fish.</font>

717
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:15,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I had short-term memory loss...</font>

718
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd just swim off into the blue
and forget everything.</font>

719
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:19,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well I don't want to do that.
I want my family.</font>

720
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:21,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not me, kid. I don't want anyone
to worry about.</font>

721
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:25,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're lucky. No memories.
No problems.</font>

722
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:28,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh. No memories. No problems.</font>

723
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:32,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still not clear. Still not clear.</font>

724
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:33,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to say when it's not time.</font>

725
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not...
- Just tell me when it is time.</font>

726
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:37,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, here we go. And... Wait!</font>

727
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Here we go. Wait."
Are you serious?</font>

728
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:40,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, on the count of three.
- Don't count. Just say, "Go."</font>

729
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go! Now, now. Do it! Do it!
- What? Okay, okay.</font>

730
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:45,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wow. Look at that! I mean...
- That's the signal.</font>

731
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:47,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go! That's the signal!</font>

732
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now remember,
Destiny said follow the signs</font>

733
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- to the Open Ocean exhibit.
- Uh-huh.</font>

734
00:38:57,086 --> 00:39:00,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't see squat,
so it's your job to look for it.</font>

735
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:02,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it. Follow the signs to Open Ocean.</font>

736
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:04,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just gonna repeat it, okay?
That should work.</font>

737
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:06,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.</font>

738
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:10,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm. Go right! Follow the signs
to Open Ocean.</font>

739
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:13,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean. Left!</font>

740
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:15,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
- And steer clear of people, will you?</font>

741
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially kids.
I don't want to be touched.</font>

742
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sh! Do not mess me up!</font>

743
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:25,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, poor baby.
Let me get that for you. Here you... Oh!</font>

744
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh my. Ugh.</font>

745
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:31,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do we go? Where do we go?</font>

746
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, sorry!
Okay, I was looking, looking...</font>

747
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:37,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roo-roo, Becky!
Drop us anywhere. We're okay.</font>

748
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:40,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just wait, Dad. I think she's looking
for a place to land.</font>

749
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:44,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's confused, Nemo. She doesn't
even know which way to look.</font>

750
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:54,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, Becky. What are you doing?
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo-roo-roo-roo.</font>

751
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:59,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I was going somewhere.
The question is where.</font>

752
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which way? Do you see the sign?</font>

753
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:05,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm looking. I'm looking. Something to
something gets me to my family!</font>

754
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:08,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The world's most powerful pair of..."</font>

755
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that. Why do I know that?
It's another memory.</font>

756
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank, we need to go that way!
Left. Go left.</font>

757
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky! Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo.</font>

758
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She can't hear you, Dad.</font>

759
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:26,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. New plan. We have to get
closer to Becky so she can hear us.</font>

760
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:29,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think we should move the pail.</font>

761
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:33,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nemo. Without me Becky's lost.</font>

762
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, just trust her.</font>

763
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:39,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust her? So she can forget us
all together?</font>

764
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:42,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I trust Becky.
- You trust her? Becky's eating a cup!</font>

765
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky! Becky! Ooo-roo! Whoa!</font>

766
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>

767
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, at least we're not stuck
in the bucket any more.</font>

768
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:05,551

Why would we follow that sign?</font>

779
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:35,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, because I remembered it.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. That wasn't the plan. Ow!</font>

00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:55,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you okay?
- Yeah! What would Dory do now?</font>

899
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:57,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's Dory?</font>

900
00:47:58,335 --> 00:48:00,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh boy. Are we happy to see you.</font>

901
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy to see me? I'm happy to see you!</font>

902
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:05,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't had anyone to talk to in years.</font>

903
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:07,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Years? Wow.</font>

904
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:09,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately we can't stay long.
We have to go because...</font>

905
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:12,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now why would you want to go?
You just landed.</font>

906
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:15,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay a while. Tell me all about yourself.</font>

907
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would love to, but my son and I
have to get to quarantine, so...</font>

908
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wonderful thing to have a son.
- Yeah it is.</font>

909
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:23,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I don't have a family.
I dated a nice scallop for a while.</font>

910
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:26,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's fascinating, but...
- But scallops have eyes.</font>

911
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:28,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she was looking for something
different. I'm kidding!</font>

912
00:48:28,365 --> 00:48:30,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, not about scallops having eyes.
They do.</font>

913
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:32,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they see into your soul
and they break your heart.</font>

914
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:37,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Shelley! Why? Why?</font>

915
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:38,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now what would Dory do?</font>

916
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:42,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Come with us as we explore</i></font>

917
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:45,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>the mysterious world
of the Open Ocean.</i></font>

918
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:49,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, Hank, follow me.
- You're in a cup.</font>

919
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. I'll follow you then.</font>

920
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:06,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait.
- An octopus has three hearts.</font>

921
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:09,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh. That's a fun fact.</font>

922
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:21,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here.
This is really happening.</font>

923
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:22,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sh!</font>

924
00:49:33,263 --> 00:49:36,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, looks like this is it, kid.
Now I got a truck to catch.</font>

925
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:39,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! Wait! I had something for you.</font>

926
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:45,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tag.
- The tag. Right!</font>

927
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:55,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
I think I'm gonna remember you.</font>

928
00:49:57,912 --> 00:50:00,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you'll forget me in a heartbeat, kid.</font>

929
00:50:00,582 --> 00:50:01,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three heartbeats.</font>

930
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:04,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll have a hard time
forgetting you though.</font>

931
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:11,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My parents are actually down there.</font>

932
00:50:16,473 --> 00:50:17,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

933
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

934
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:21,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm ready.</font>

935
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:24,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I think you are.</font>

936
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:26,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

937
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:31,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!</font>

938
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:39,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are they? Where are they?
Where are they? Okay. Okay.</font>

939
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:50,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pardon me. Oh. Hi. Hello. Have you
seen a mom and a dad without me?</font>

940
00:50:50,924 --> 00:50:52,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me. Have you seen a couple?</font>

941
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:54,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're old like you.</font>

942
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:56,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not old like you,
but older than you even.</font>

943
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:57,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Bye.</font>

944
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:03,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. Do you know anyone who lost a kid
a long time ago that would be me?</font>

945
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:06,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know how long ago exact...
Okay. You're in a hurry.</font>

946
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ho, ho! Watch where you're going.
- Oh sorry.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It's our goal that every

949
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shells.</font>

950
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:32,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there we go.
Now, if you ever get lost, Dory...</font>

951
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:34,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just follow the shells.</font>

952
00:51:34,384 --> 00:51:35,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, look! Shells!</font>

953
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:45,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow the shells.</font>

954
00:51:57,365 --> 00:52:00,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, I live there.
- Yes, yes indeed.</font>

955
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:03,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My home. That's my home!</font>

956
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom! Dad!</font>

957
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:11,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, kelpcake. Now count to ten.</font>

958
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>

961
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you talking to, kelpcake?</font>

962
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:23,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My pipe pal, Destiny!</font>

963
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:30,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom? Dad?</font>

- What's going to happen to her?</font>

966
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There, there, Jenny.</font>

967
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:58,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh no, don't cry, Mommy. Don't cry.</font>

968
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:01,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think she's... That she can
make it on her own, Charlie?</font>

969
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:04,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, honey. It'll be okay.</font>

970
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy loves purple shells.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dory!
- Mommy! Daddy!</font>

974
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:31,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My parents...</font>

975
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:34,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I lost them.</font>

976
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was my fault.</font>

977
00:53:45,807 --> 00:53:47,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where's your tag?
- Huh?</font>

978
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:51,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your tag. It's missing.
That why you're not in quarantine?</font>

979
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:52,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Quarantine?
- Yeah!</font>

980
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:55,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's where they took all
the blue tangs. Isn't that right, Bill?</font>

981
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:59,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep. The blue tangs are getting
their own exhibit in Cleveland.</font>

982
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Being shipped out on a truck
at the crack of dawn. Must be nice.</font>

983
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:04,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No! No, my parents
are back in quarantine?</font>

984
00:54:05,118 --> 00:54:07,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're being shipped to Cleveland?
But I just got here!</font>

985
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:09,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got to get to them.
They don't know I'm here.</font>

986
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry,
it's easy to get to quarantine.</font>

987
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can just go through the pipes,
honey.</font>

988
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:19,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Oh I can't do that.</font>

989
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:22,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why not?
- I'll forget where I'm going.</font>

990
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:25,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I can't be somewhere
where I have nobody to help me.</font>

991
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:28,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, then I guess you're stuck here.
- You're not helping, Bill.</font>

992
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just go in there if you want to.
You'll be fine.</font>

993
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:36,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh boy.</font>

994
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:40,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could you tell me how to get there?
Through the pipes?</font>

995
00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:45,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, honey. It's two lefts
and then a right. Simple.</font>

996
00:54:49,162 --> 00:54:50,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

997
00:54:52,874 --> 00:54:55,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two lefts and a right. I can do this.</font>

998
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:58,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two lefts and a right. Okay.
Don't forget.</font>

999
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two lefts and a right.
Two lefts and a right.</font>

1000
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:11,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two lefts and a right. Two lefts
and a right. Two lefts and a right.</font>

1001
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:17,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two lefts and a right? Shoot.</font>

1002
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:22,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Left and a right. Wait.
Did I already take a left?</font>

1003
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:26,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh no. It's happening. Okay, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.</font>

1004
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:30,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which way? Where am I going?
I can't remember. Okay.</font>

1005
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I'm lost. It's too hard.
I can't remember.</font>

1006
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:33,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm forgetting everything.</font>

1007
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:37,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna be stuck forever in the pipes.
The pipes! The pipe pals.</font>

1008
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:40,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pipe pals? Pipe pals!</font>

1009
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:44,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And... swim, swim, swim.
- Yeah, I don't know about this.</font>

1010
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:46,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me,
I won't let you hit anything. Wall!</font>

1011
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:49,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the point?
I'll never learn to get around!</font>

1012
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:52,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You better! If you can't do it in here
you'll never do it out in the ocean.</font>

1013
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:55,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now really focus, okay? Wall!</font>

1014
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:56,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Destiny!</font>

1015
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory? Hello?</font>

1016
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,650

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on, Dory! Bailey!
You've got to use your echolocation!</font>

1018
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:07,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know it's broken!</font>

1019
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:09,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stop it, and try the "Ooh" thing
Dory talked about, will you?</font>

1020
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:12,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But I don't think I can...
- Don't bail on me, Bailey!</font>

1021
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:15,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh!</font>

1022
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh! Ooh!</font>

1023
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:21,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Bailey. What did you
just tell me, huh? Really focus!</font>

1024
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:23,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh! I feel stupid.</font>

1025
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bailey.
- Sorry. Ooh!</font>

1026
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello?
- Here!</font>

1027
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:29,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here!</font>

1028
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:32,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Guys... Ooh! Guys... Ooh!
- What? What is it?</font>

1029
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:37,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm getting something! Ooh!
Here we go! Ooh! Oh yes! Ooh!</font>

1030
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:41,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see the quarantine!
This is amazing!</font>

1031
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:46,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh! I can see everything!
And I can see you!</font>

1032
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He can see you!</font>

1033
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:50,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My life's a rainbow! Can you see me?</font>

1034
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:52,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right,
it doesn't work that way.</font>

1035
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:54,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bailey!
- Okay! Tell Dory to go left!</font>

1036
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:56,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says go left!</font>

1037
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:57,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Left?</font>

1038
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ooh! Straight!
- Straight!</font>

1039
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:03,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Straight!
- Ooh! Go right!</font>

1040
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:05,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right!
- Right!</font>

1041
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:09,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh! I'm light-headed! Ooh! Wait. Ooh!</font>

1042
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:11,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm picking up something else.
Hold on! Let me zoom out.</font>

1043
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:13,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zzz...</font>

1044
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy Neptune, she's not alone! Ooh!</font>

1045
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:17,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is it?
- I can't tell! But it's coming for her.</font>

1046
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:21,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh no! Dory, swim!
Swim the other way!</font>

1047
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:22,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What? Where?
- What? Where?</font>

1048
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:24,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go right!
- Right!</font>

1049
00:57:26,611 --> 00:57:29,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, my right!
Oh no! She's heading right towards it!</font>

1050
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:31,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! Dory, turn around!</font>

1051
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's great, Dory!
You're headed right toward us!</font>

1052
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:37,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? You want me to go right?</font>

1053
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No! Not right. Oh, I can't look!</font>

1054
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:44,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dory!
- Marlin?</font>

1055
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I knew it! You're okay!
- Oh my gosh!</font>

1056
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:50,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's consuming her!
It's eating her alive!</font>

1057
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:54,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're okay!
- You found me! How did you find me?</font>

1058
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was a crazy clam.
He wouldn't stop talking.</font>

1059
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:59,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just slowly backed away from him
and into these pipes.</font>

1060
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:01,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then we just started looking.</font>

1061
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:04,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory! I'm sorry!</font>

1062
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:06,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, what was that?</font>

1063
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on. I got to take this.</font>

1064
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:10,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay! Sorry for what?</font>

1065
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:12,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? You're okay?</font>

1066
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes!
- I found Marlin and Nemo!</font>

1067
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:18,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad! Did you hear that?
Dory really does speak whale.</font>

1068
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:19,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard.</font>

1069
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:22,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's bringing back some very bad
memories so let's get out of here.</font>

1070
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:26,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say we go this way.
Follow me. It's time to head home!</font>

1071
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:30,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait, wait! Um...
My parents are here.</font>

1072
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:31,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They are?
- You found your parents?</font>

1073
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:36,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, not exactly. No. I mean not yet,
but, um, I know where they are.</font>

1074
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:40,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know exactly how to get there,
but I know that... I'm getting help...</font>

1075
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Down to quarantine.
- Quarantine.</font>

1076
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:46,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it! Oh, and I met
this septopus, super cranky...</font>

1077
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:51,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but secretly kind of sweet, and he
got me into the exhibit... The exhibit.</font>

1078
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:55,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory?</font>

1079
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:58,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think my parents
will want to see me?</font>

1080
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Why wouldn't they
want to see you?</font>

1081
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:04,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because... I lost them?</font>

1082
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:09,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory, your parents are going to be
overjoyed to see you.</font>

1083
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:13,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're going to have missed...
everything about you.</font>

1084
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:16,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- Do you know how we found you?</font>

1085
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Something about a clam? Or...
- No.</font>

1086
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, an oyster.
- No.</font>

1087
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:20,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mollusc?
- No.</font>

1088
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:21,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Something?
- No.</font>

1089
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't... No?
- No clam.</font>

1090
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:25,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were having a very hard time
until Nemo thought...</font>

1091
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:27,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"What would Dory do?"</font>

1092
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:29,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would you say that?</font>

1093
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because ever since I've met you,
you've shown me how to do...</font>

1094
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:37,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">stuff I never dreamed of doing.
Crazy things!</font>

1095
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:41,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Outsmarting sharks
and jumping jellyfish.</font>

1096
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:46,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And finding my son.
You made all that happen.</font>

1097
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:52,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? I didn't know you thought that.
Unless I forgot.</font>

1098
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:57,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you didn't forget. I never told you.</font>

1099
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:00,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm sorry about that.</font>

1100
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:08,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, Dory, because of who you are,
you are about to find your parents.</font>

1101
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:16,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when you do that, you'll be home.</font>

1102
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad.</font>

1103
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:33,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does this mean
we have to say goodbye to Dory?</font>

1104
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:37,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Nemo. We do.</font>

1105
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:59,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, so how much more
we got left to load?</font>

1106
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:00,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, just this last row.</font>

1107
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:03,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sooner we finish,
the sooner this truck gets to Cleveland.</font>

1108
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:06,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch the turn.
Watch what? Ow!</font>

1109
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:09,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too late.
Okay, I think we're close. Whee!</font>

1110
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi!</font>

1111
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:13,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this quarantine?</font>

1112
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! This is it!
We're in quarantine!</font>

1113
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:18,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My parents are here!</font>

1114
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:19,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are we going?
Hey, what...</font>

1115
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, why are we going towards the door?</font>

1116
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:23,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We are all better!
- Yay!</font>

1117
01:01:23,389 --> 01:01:25,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel fantastic!</font>

1118
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:27,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude.</font>

1119
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:33,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My family! Come on, let's go!
Excuse me.</font>

1120
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:34,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory, wait a minute!</font>

1121
01:01:37,987 --> 01:01:41,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming Mommy! I'm coming Daddy!</font>

1122
01:01:42,575 --> 01:01:45,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo-hoo! Almost home.
Almost home. I'm almost home.</font>

1123
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:48,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm getting
the hang of this! Oh!</font>

1124
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:53,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear footsteps.</font>

1125
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hank!
- Quiet.</font>

1126
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:00,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank, we need to get in that tank.
That rhymed.</font>

1127
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why?
- Her parents are there!</font>

1128
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:03,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1129
01:02:04,013 --> 01:02:07,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you've got three minutes
to get everyone in this cup with you...</font>

1130
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:10,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then I'm on that truck
to Cleveland, got it?</font>

1131
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:11,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it.</font>

1132
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:16,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh boy.</font>

1133
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:22,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom? Dad?</font>

1134
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:27,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom? Dad?
Hey, everybody. It's me, Dory!</font>

1135
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory? Dory? Dory?
Jenny and Charlie's Dory? Dory?</font>

1136
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom? Dad?</font>

1137
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:35,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom? Dad?</font>

1138
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom? Dad?</font>

1139
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:42,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She should just pick 2 and let's go.
- Dad.</font>

1140
01:02:42,343 --> 01:02:44,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? I'm kidding. It's a reunion.</font>

1141
01:02:44,887 --> 01:02:48,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom? Dad? Where are my parents?</font>

1142
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory? Are you really
Jenny and Charlie's girl?</font>

1143
01:02:52,895 --> 01:02:55,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I am! That's me! Where are they?</font>

1144
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:59,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, well, Dory, right after
you disappeared, they thought you...</font>

1145
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they thought you must have
ended up here, in quarantine.</font>

1146
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh-huh?
- Come on, come on, come on.</font>

1147
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:09,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so they came here to look for you.</font>

1148
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:11,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're here! Where are they?</font>

1149
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:17,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory, that was years ago.</font>

1150
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:20,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Huh?
- They never came back.</font>

1151
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:21,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh no.</font>

1152
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:25,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, Dory, when fish
don't come back from quarantine...</font>

1153
01:03:25,928 --> 01:03:28,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it means they're not...</font>

1154
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:29,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1155
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:32,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory, they're gone.</font>

1156
01:03:32,685 --> 01:03:35,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're dead?</font>

1157
01:03:35,813 --> 01:03:39,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They wanted to find you...
- Wait. Are you sure they're gone?</font>

1158
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:42,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory, listen, it's going to be okay.</font>

1159
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:43,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory, they loved you so much.</font>

1160
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:46,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone not looking to go to Cleveland,
final warning!</font>

1161
01:03:49,618 --> 01:03:52,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dory, are you all right?
- Are you okay?</font>

1162
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I was too late.
- Dory, no. No. Now listen.</font>

1163
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:59,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't have a family.
- No, Dory. That's not true.</font>

1164
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:02,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time to go!</font>

1165
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:04,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm all alone.</font>

1166
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory.
Dory!</font>

1167
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:09,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's everybody else?</font>

1168
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:13,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your orange friends are on their way
to Cleveland. Ah!</font>

1169
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found the octopus!</font>

1170
01:04:16,562 --> 01:04:18,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did he go?</font>

1171
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:28,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy? Daddy?</font>

1172
01:04:35,289 --> 01:04:36,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help.</font>

1173
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:42,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No. No. Help. Help. Help me.</font>

1174
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:48,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help. Help me. Please.
Somebody help me!</font>

1175
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:51,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, can... Help me?
Can you help me? I've lost them!</font>

1176
01:04:52,014 --> 01:04:55,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh. Lost who?
- I-I-I-I...</font>

1177
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:58,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, sorry, honey. I can't help you
if you don't remember.</font>

1178
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:00,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

1179
01:05:01,774 --> 01:05:04,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Can you help me? I've lost... them.</font>

1180
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:06,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, can you be more specific?</font>

1181
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My... My... Them! Them! Them!</font>

1182
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:10,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um... Um...</font>

1183
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:13,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

1184
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:17,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help! Help!</font>

1185
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please? They're gone!</font>

1186
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:40,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've lost... I've lost everyone.
There's nothing I can do.</font>

1187
01:05:43,065 --> 01:05:47,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoot, I can't forget.
What was I forgetting? Something.</font>

1188
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something important. What was it? I...</font>

1189
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:56,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was it? It's going away.</font>

1190
01:05:57,204 --> 01:06:01,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's going away. It's going because
all I can do is forget. I just forget.</font>

1191
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:05,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I forget.
That's what I do best. That's what I do.</font>

1192
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:11,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?</font>

1193
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:15,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would Dory do?</font>

1194
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:19,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would look around.</font>

1195
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:25,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, um, there's just water over there.
And a lot of kelp over here.</font>

1196
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kelp is better. Okay.</font>

1197
01:06:34,283 --> 01:06:38,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Now what? Lots of kelp.
It looks the same.</font>

1198
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:44,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It all looks the same,
except there's a rock... over there.</font>

1199
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:50,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And some sand this way.
I like sand. Sand is squishy.</font>

1200
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh this isn't going anywhere.</font>

1201
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:14,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing here.
Nothing but kelp. Lots of kelp.</font>

1202
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:18,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And some shells... this way.</font>

1203
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:21,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like shells.</font>

1204
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:28,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like... shells.</font>

1205
01:07:54,947 --> 01:07:56,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

1206
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:35,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello. I'm...</font>

1207
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:38,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dory!
- Dory! You're here.</font>

1208
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:40,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh my baby!
- You're really here.</font>

1209
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:42,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let me look at you.
- You found us.</font>

1210
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:44,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm never letting you go again.
- Oh my missing girl, you're here.</font>

1211
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:45,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My baby!
- It's you.</font>

1212
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:49,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes! Oh absolutely!
- It's really you! Mom, you're here.</font>

1213
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:52,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am, I...
- And Dad, so are you.</font>

1214
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:53,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right here, kelpcake.</font>

1215
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:58,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.</font>

1216
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:01,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh honey. Oh honey, no. Kelpcake.</font>

1217
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:05,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I've got a problem. I know I'm...
And I'm so sorry.</font>

1218
01:09:05,726 --> 01:09:09,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And all this time I've wanted to fix it
and I can't and I try. I try.</font>

1219
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:12,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my thoughts... they leave my head
and ideas change.</font>

1220
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'd forgotten you and I'm so sorry.</font>

1221
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:20,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory. Don't you dare be sorry.
Look what you did.</font>

1222
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:24,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- You found us!</font>

1223
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:26,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right. You found us.</font>

1224
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:30,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, why do you think
we stayed put here all these years?</font>

1225
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:34,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we believed one day
you'd find us again.</font>

1226
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly!</font>

1227
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:39,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I thought you were gone.
How did you...</font>

1228
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:43,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We went into quarantine
to look for you, but you weren't there.</font>

1229
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:46,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we knew you must have
gotten out through the pipes.</font>

1230
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:48,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Through the pipes. That's right, sweetie.
And so we did too.</font>

1231
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:52,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we've stayed in this spot for you
ever since.</font>

1232
01:09:52,773 --> 01:09:55,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We thought you might come back.
- We stayed and waited for you.</font>

1233
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:58,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So every day, we go out and lay out...</font>

1234
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:00,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shells.</font>

1235
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:10,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you found us.
Oh honey, you found us.</font>

1236
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:13,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you know why you found us?
Because you remembered.</font>

1237
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:19,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You remembered
in your own, amazing, Dory way.</font>

1238
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did. All by myself.</font>

1239
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:30,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, honey. Really? Have you been
by yourself all these years?</font>

1240
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my poor little girl.</font>

1241
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:36,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I haven't been all by myself...
Marlin and Nemo!</font>

1242
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:39,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nobody saw where Dory went?
- No. Sorry. I didn't see anything.</font>

1243
01:10:39,945 --> 01:10:42,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously? That's a lot
of eyeballs doing nothing.</font>

1244
01:10:43,115 --> 01:10:44,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Oh, excuse me. Can you help us?</font>

1245
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:46,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're looking...
- Me help you?</font>

1246
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:52,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, look! It's Dory.</font>

1247
01:10:52,124 --> 01:10:56,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thank goodness. See, Nemo,
I knew she'd find a way... What?</font>

1248
01:10:56,712 --> 01:10:58,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where's Dory? Is she with you?</font>

1249
01:10:58,213 --> 01:11:00,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1250
01:11:00,382 --> 01:11:03,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried to hold on,
but I couldn't and I lost her.</font>

1251
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- All right. Let's get going.</font>

1252
01:11:05,554 --> 01:11:06,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1253
01:11:06,888 --> 01:11:09,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then the whale swallowed us
even though I speak whale.</font>

1254
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:10,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A whale?</font>

1255
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:11,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good thing I wasn't
there to see that.</font>

1256
01:11:11,727 --> 01:11:13,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually Marlin never believes
I even know how to speak whale...</font>

1257
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:15,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you know what, he always kind of
trusts me anyway.</font>

1258
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:17,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I like this Marlin already.</font>

1259
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:19,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. And then somehow
we found Nemo. Or did he find me?</font>

1260
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:22,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. But, you know what,
Nemo is the sweetest.</font>

1261
01:11:22,738 --> 01:11:24,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just never gives up on me
no matter what.</font>

1262
01:11:24,531 --> 01:11:25,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, what would Dory do?</font>

1263
01:11:25,866 --> 01:11:28,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we'll certainly have to thank
Marlin and Nemo when we meet them.</font>

1264
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. Wait I know this place.</font>

1265
01:11:32,581 --> 01:11:35,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hello. I'm Sigourney Weaver.</i></font>

1266
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:37,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There!
<i>- Won't you please join us?</i></font>

1267
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:41,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's the Marine Life Institute.
- Oh, you were born there.</font>

1268
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:42,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory, is that where your friends are?</font>

1269
01:11:42,716 --> 01:11:46,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! They were stuck in something.
It was going somewhere.</font>

1270
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A truck. They're in the truck!</font>

1271
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:51,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That means I could...
Never see them again!</font>

1272
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:54,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No, no, no. What would Dory do?</font>

1273
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:59,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, I know they're good friends of yours,
but a truck is kind of a tall order.</font>

1274
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:02,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please! Please.
All I know is that I miss them. I... I...</font>

1275
01:12:02,736 --> 01:12:07,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really miss them.
I've said that before.</font>

1276
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

1277
01:12:10,202 --> 01:12:11,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory?</font>

1278
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:16,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, Marlin and Nemo are more
than good friends, they're family.</font>

1279
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:20,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I have to get them back.
See, when they found me it felt like fate.</font>

1280
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:23,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what I mean? Or... I don't...
What's another word for fate?</font>

1281
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:26,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like destiny. Destiny?</font>

1282
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Destiny!</font>

1283
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dory?
- Destiny!</font>

1284
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:33,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Morning, Dest...
- Sh. It's Dory. Something's wrong.</font>

1285
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:38,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh. I got her.
She's right outside the institute.</font>

1286
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:42,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Destiny?
- We got to jump.</font>

1287
01:12:42,067 --> 01:12:43,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jump?
- No time to argue!</font>

1288
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:45,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Destiny!</font>

1289
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:48,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory! The truck thing
with your friends is leaving!</font>

1290
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:50,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. Destiny.</font>

1291
01:12:50,325 --> 01:12:52,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh no! That's bad!
What do we do?</font>

1292
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:56,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right.
- Yes.</font>

1293
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Here we go. One. Two.
- Yes. Yes.</font>

1294
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:00,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't! I can't do it!
I'll never make it out there.</font>

1295
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:04,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Destiny! I've got the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.</font>

1296
01:13:04,631 --> 01:13:06,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.</font>

1297
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:07,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will be your eyes.</font>

1298
01:13:07,968 --> 01:13:10,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can be my eyes. But the walls!</font>

1299
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:12,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are no walls in the ocean!</font>

1300
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:16,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No walls?
- It's your destiny, Destiny.</font>

1301
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:18,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, why didn't you say so?</font>

1302
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:21,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No! Destiny, wait!
No, that's a wall! Wall!</font>

1303
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, Dad, this is my pipe pal.
Destiny, say hi.</font>

1304
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:32,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory! Are these little blue blobs
your parents?</font>

1305
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:33,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They look just like you!</font>

1306
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:36,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello. I'm Bailey. Mrs. Dory, Mr. Dory.</font>

1307
01:13:36,997 --> 01:13:38,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh please, call me Jenny.
- Oh and I'm Charlie.</font>

1308
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Okay. We got to go.
We got to stop that truck.</font>

1309
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:42,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, what truck?</font>

1310
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:46,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bailey, status report.</font>

1311
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:49,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes, my beautiful gift. Ooh.</font>

1312
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:51,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Found it! The truck's merging
onto the freeway</font>

1313
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's heading south. Ooh.</font>

1314
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:55,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go. We are stopping that truck.</font>

1315
01:13:57,058 --> 01:13:59,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This I've got to see.
- Yeah, yeah, me too!</font>

1316
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh boy, this is gonna be good!</font>

1317
01:14:03,023 --> 01:14:05,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the... Gerald!
Have you lost your marbles?</font>

1318
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't get used to it, Gerald!
- Cheeky joke.</font>

1319
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:13,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bailey, I forgot everything.
Catch me up.</font>

1320
01:14:13,408 --> 01:14:16,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am. Ooh.
Your friends are still on the truck.</font>

1321
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:19,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh. They're headed north
towards the bridge. Ooh.</font>

1322
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:21,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, look, there's a bunch of
cute otters over there.</font>

1323
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:23,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want one! Ow!</font>

1324
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:27,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow, Bailey!</font>

1325
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:30,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! I see the truck. It's over there.</font>

1326
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:32,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, what would Dory do?
- I don't see how we can get on it.</font>

1327
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:34,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man, if only there was a way
to stop traffic.</font>

1328
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:36,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop traffic. Stop traffic!
Everyone needs to stop.</font>

1329
01:14:37,015 --> 01:14:38,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People stop to look at things.</font>

1330
01:14:38,058 --> 01:14:39,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things that they like.
Things that are cute.</font>

1331
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:42,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things that are cute!
Okay, I got it.</font>

1332
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:44,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What? What is it?
- Quickly before I forget.</font>

1333
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:47,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Destiny, when the truck reaches
the bridge you flip me up there.</font>

1334
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:47,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it.</font>

1335
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:50,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys, follow me.
Everyone else, stay here.</font>

1336
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:54,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. Dory.
Honey, you're not leaving us again.</font>

1337
01:14:54,783 --> 01:14:56,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mother's right.
You have to stay with us.</font>

1338
01:14:56,618 --> 01:15:00,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory, what happens if...
You know, if you're gone for too long.</font>

1339
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:03,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what if you get confused and that
makes you distracted. And what if...</font>

1340
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:04,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lose you again?</font>

1341
01:15:05,627 --> 01:15:07,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Yes.</font>

1342
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:11,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, Dad,
it's gonna be okay because...</font>

1343
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that even if I forget
I can find you again.</font>

1344
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:23,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh. Okay a little left. Ooh.
Back the other way a bit.</font>

1345
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:25,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh. Okay, that's it. Go! Don't do it.</font>

1346
01:15:26,106 --> 01:15:28,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bailey!
- Okay, now! Now! Do it! Do it!</font>

1347
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Time for your idea.
- Okay. What idea?</font>

1348
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:41,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. What do I do?
What would Dory do?</font>

1349
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:43,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, cars, cars. I see cars.
Otters in front of cars.</font>

1350
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:46,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cars have to stop.
Stop traffic! Cuddle party!</font>

1351
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:50,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look out!</font>

1352
01:15:52,424 --> 01:15:54,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're so cute!</font>

1353
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:57,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at them! There must be one, two...</font>

1354
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:02,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's going on, Dad?
- I don't know how.</font>

1355
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:05,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know in what way, but I think
this has something to do with...</font>

1356
01:16:08,732 --> 01:16:12,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dory!
- Water. Water. I need water.</font>

1357
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:14,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you crazy? How'd you get here?</font>

1358
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dory!
- Oh!</font>

1359
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I thought we'd never see you again.
- Aw, me too.</font>

1360
01:16:19,993 --> 01:16:23,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, darn it, no matter how hard I tried
I just couldn't forget you.</font>

1361
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:26,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I missed the rest of my family
too much, huh?</font>

1362
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:28,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're family?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

1363
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:31,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what that feels like?</font>

1364
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:34,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I know what that feels like.</font>

1365
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:37,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw!</font>

1366
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:40,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Hey, come on. Out of the truck.
Those aren't your fish. Shoo!</font>

1367
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:43,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh no. There goes our ride.
- Back in the water. Come on.</font>

1368
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:46,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory,
the traffic is starting to move.</font>

1369
01:16:47,145 --> 01:16:48,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave it to me. I got this.</font>

1370
01:16:48,396 --> 01:16:51,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo.</font>

1371
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:54,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky! Becky, come back.
We need your help! Becky!</font>

1372
01:16:56,571 --> 01:16:57,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory, follow me.</font>

1373
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:02,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, wait. We don't have Dory!
No, no, Becky wait! Stop it.</font>

1374
01:17:02,577 --> 01:17:07,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to go back. Becky, back!
Back, Becky! Loo-loo. Ooo-roo-roo.</font>

1375
01:17:07,457 --> 01:17:09,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please don't eat us!
- Where's Dory?</font>

1376
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:11,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who are you?
- Jenny?</font>

1377
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:12,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Marlin?
- Charlie?</font>

1378
01:17:12,921 --> 01:17:14,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nemo? Thank you so much.</font>

1379
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:16,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for taking care of Dory.</font>

1380
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:18,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dory! She's still in the truck.</font>

1381
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:22,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky! Fetch Dory! Ooo-roo. Dor-roo.</font>

1382
01:17:26,351 --> 01:17:28,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, kid. I guess this is goodbye.</font>

1383
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:29,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No!
- What do you mean, "No"?</font>

1384
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:32,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not going to the Cleveland.
You are coming to the ocean with me.</font>

1385
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:34,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it with you
and ruining my plans?</font>

1386
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:37,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me, I have one goal in life.
One! And it is to...</font>

1387
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:41,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you listen to me. What is so great
about plans? I never had a plan.</font>

1388
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:44,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I plan to lose my parents? No.
Did I plan to find Marlin? No.</font>

1389
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:47,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you and I plan to meet?
Wait. Did we?</font>

1390
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:49,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you almost done?
- Well, I don't think we did.</font>

1391
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's because the best things
happen by chance. Because that's life.</font>

1392
01:17:53,086 --> 01:17:57,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's you being with me out
in the ocean not safe in some glass box.</font>

1393
01:17:57,799 --> 01:17:58,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I say something?
- I'm not done!</font>

1394
01:17:58,925 --> 01:18:02,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A friend of mine... Her name's
Sigourney... Once told me that...</font>

1395
01:18:02,262 --> 01:18:03,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all it takes is three simple steps:</font>

1396
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:07,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rescue, rehabilitation,
and one other thing...</font>

1397
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:09,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Release!</font>

1398
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:11,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right! So what do you say?</font>

1399
01:18:11,938 --> 01:18:14,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Release! Release! Release!</font>

1400
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:18,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Release! Release! Release!</font>

1401
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:21,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Release! Release! Release!</font>

1402
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:22,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was gonna say, "Okay."</font>

1403
01:18:24,993 --> 01:18:26,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not good.</font>

1404
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:28,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh no! They're going away!
Oh no! Dory! What do we do?</font>

1405
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:30,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quick! Guys, grab my fin!</font>

1406
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:36,127
