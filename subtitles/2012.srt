1
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,461
<i>This dam project will create many new jobs!</i>

2
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,966
<i>The Party will assist in your relocation!</i>

3
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,178
Grandma, give me your hand.

4
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,056
- But where are they taking us?
- It'll be all right.

5
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,520
Brother!

6
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,357
Grandma! I will send you money!

7
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,655
<i>Who can write?!</i>

8
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,824
Who can read?!

9
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,410
Who can weld?!

10
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,819
<i>I put a lot of faith into your organization.</i>

11
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,407
<i>It's a perfect replica, Roland.</i>

12
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,811
There are too many fanatics out there
who could damage her.

13
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,435
Just think about the

14
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:06,465
<i>beautiful Buddha statues
they blew up in Afghanistan.</i>

15
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,400
<i>Our Heritage Organization</i>

16
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:10,813
has already made selections,

17
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,797
<i>from the British Museum and L'hermitage.</i>

18
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,141
I guess she'll be safe now tucked away,

19
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:29,321
hidden... in some bunker in Switzerland.

20
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,108
Perfectly safe, Roland.

21
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,196
<i>Only infrared analysis would reveal the difference.</i>

22
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,616
But it's still a fake.

23
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,751
Hello?

24
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,586
<i>Laura!</i>

25
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,755
<i>Laura, can you hear me?!</i>

26
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,632
<i>Roland, is that you?</i>

27
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,759
<i>Laura, they lied to us.</i>

28
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,178
I've arranged a press conference for tomorrow.

29
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,764
I will tell everyone the truth
about what's going on.

30
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,433
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

31
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,543
The art you collected?

32
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,562
It's not in the Alps.

33
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,105
<i>Those tunnels are empty.</i>

34
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,456
<i>I have proof.</i>

35
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:07,076
Laura!

36
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,610
Laura, can you hear me?!

37
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,373
I'm losing you.

38
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:11,413
Roland?!

39
00:17:11,535 --> 00:17:12,746
Can you hear me?!

40
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:13,216
Laura!

41
00:39:05,178 --> 00:39:07,262
I feared you would not come!

42
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:20,442
Zultan, listen to me.

43
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,612
We are fighters, we never go down,

44
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:27,533
no matter how hard they hit us!

45
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,286
<i>Kill the bastard!</i>

46
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:15,664
Yuri! Where are you going?!

47
01:19:20,427 --> 01:19:24,346
<i>Do not believe in something simply
because you have heard it, Nima.</i>

48
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:28,225
But, Great Lama, Tenzin is my brother.

49
01:19:29,269 --> 01:19:32,229
He works inside the big tunnel,
where the ships are built.

50
01:19:35,316 --> 01:19:39,778
But what is there in your wisdom,
great Lama, if Tenzin is right?

51
01:19:40,405 --> 01:19:42,823
What if our world is indeed coming to an end?

52
01:19:52,959 --> 01:19:54,080
Great Rinpoche...

53
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:55,012
It is full.

54
01:19:56,912 --> 01:19:58,012
It's full!

55
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:03,052
<i>Like this cup,</i>

56
01:20:03,419 --> 01:20:08,523
you are full of opinions and speculations.

57
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:11,393
<i>To see the light of wisdom,</i>

58
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:14,605
you first must empty your cup.

59
01:20:32,248 --> 01:20:33,749
<i>Be careful with the clutch.</i>

60
01:20:34,584 --> 01:20:36,585
It tends to slip.

61
01:20:54,896 --> 01:20:55,657
Grandma!

62
01:20:55,859 --> 01:20:58,141
Grandpa! Nima is here!

63
01:20:58,525 --> 01:21:00,275
Grandma, I got a message from Tenzin.

64
01:21:00,652 --> 01:21:03,445
He wants us to meet him
in Cho Ming at the west gate.

65
01:21:04,197 --> 01:21:07,116
He says he can get us
on the ships he's working on.

66
01:21:08,118 --> 01:21:11,370
What are you talking about?
Tenzin works on the dam.

67
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:15,391
Grandma...

68
01:21:16,876 --> 01:21:17,827
The dam is a ship!

69
01:21:18,529 --> 01:21:20,255
<i>The government lied to us!</i>

70
01:21:20,588 --> 01:21:22,273
<i>There will be a big flood!</i>

71
01:21:23,341 --> 01:21:24,800
We must pack up right away!

72
01:21:25,093 --> 01:21:25,693
<i>Nima!</i>

73
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:27,821
He gave you the truck?

74
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:31,640
<i>We took a trip on the Laem Song ferry once.</i>

75
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,662
Grandpa threw up...

76
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:34,853
<i>the whole way.</i>

77
01:21:36,354 --> 01:21:37,646
Let's eat first.

78
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:31,464
Who are they?!

79
01:55:32,331 --> 01:55:33,940
We found them along side of the road.

80
01:55:34,309 --> 01:55:35,451
Send them back!

81
01:55:41,858 --> 01:55:43,400
I am a follower,

82
01:55:44,319 --> 01:55:46,028
of our great Lama Rinpoche.

83
01:55:46,821 --> 01:55:48,238
You know I cannot do that!

84
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:29,655
We are all children of the earth.

85
01:56:29,823 --> 01:56:33,325
Grandma, my plan will not work for so many!

86
01:56:33,493 --> 01:56:36,413
We will take them all.

87
01:57:55,825 --> 01:57:56,825
Tenzin wait!

88
01:57:58,411 --> 01:58:00,412
Grandma! we're almost there!

89
02:00:28,103 --> 02:00:29,153
Daddy look!

90
02:10:59,109 --> 02:11:00,984
<i>Tenzin, almost there!</i>

91
02:11:02,112 --> 02:11:03,454
Nima, what happened?

92
02:18:18,949 --> 02:18:20,366
<i>Grandma, Grandpa.</i>

93
02:18:20,967 --> 02:18:22,393
I'm sorry.

94
02:18:23,011 --> 02:18:24,226
I could not save us.

95
02:18:24,228 --> 02:18:26,990
He has gone back in. He will fix it.

96
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:30,517
There's no way.

97
02:18:31,728 --> 02:18:33,729
Don't lose your faith, brother.
