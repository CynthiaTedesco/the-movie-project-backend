Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

498

Genetic power's the most awesome
force the planet's ever seen

It's hardly appropriate

If I may.

502
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,639
I'll tell you the problem with the
scientific power you're using here.

503
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,721
It didn't require
any discipline to attain it.

504
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:43,476
You read what others had done,
and you took the next step.

505
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,026
You didn't earn the
knowledge for yourselves

506
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,230
so you don't take
any responsibility for it.

507
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:52,113
You stood on the shoulders
of geniuses to accomplish

508
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,392
something as fast as you could.

509
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:57,622
Before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, and packaged it

510
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,541
and slapped it on a plastic lunch
box, now you're selling it.

511
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:01,664
You're going to sell it.

512
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,667
I don't think you're
giving us our due credit.

513
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:09,001
Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.

514
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,213
But your scientists were so
preoccupied with whether they could,

515
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,172
they didn't stop to
think if they should.

516
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:18,261
Condors. Condors are
on the verge of extinction.

517
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,522
If I was to create a flock of
condors on this island,

518
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,224
you wouldn't have
anything to say.

519
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,026
Hold on, this isn't some
species that was obliterated

520
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,322
by deforestation or
the building of a dam.

521
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:35,779
Dinosaurs had their shot and nature
selected them for extinction.

522
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:41,458
I don't understand this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.

523
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:46,455
How can we stand in the light
of discovery and not act?

524
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,960
What's so great about discovery?

525
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,212
It's a violent, penetrative act,

526
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,636
that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery,

527
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,341
I call the rape of
the natural world.

528
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,805
The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct Eco-system?

529
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,016
And therefore, how could you ever
assume that you can control it?

530
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:09,069
You have poisonous plants
in this building.

531

You picked them
because they look good.

532
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:14,025
But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in

533
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:17,281
and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.

and we're all running to catch up.

conclusions, but dinosaurs and man,

million years of evolution

539

back into the mix together.

slightest idea what to expect?
