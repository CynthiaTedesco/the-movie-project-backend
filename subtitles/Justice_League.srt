00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,793
TIMM:
I think on a kind of a primal level,

3
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,967
I think there's just something about
having superpowered characters team up

4
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:14,636
with other superpowered characters
is just very appealing.

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:15,712
All right.

6
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:16,796
DiDIO: Each one ofthem
are true individuals

7
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,348
and they all have
their own sense of right and wrong.

8
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,177
While they might not share
exact same beliefs

9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,637
they do share a common good
and a common goal.

10
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,522
So they then have to adapt and change

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,226
and become bigger and better heroes,

12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,194
to unite and work together.

13
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,655
WOLFMAN: And that's great drama
and that’s great storytelling.

14
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,734
It is what has allowed
the Justice League to continue

15
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:37,817
for the last 50 years.

16
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,746
JOHNS: There is a great history
to explore in the Justice League.

17
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,833
The team and these characters
live in all these different media.

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,536
Comic books, animation,
video games, toys.

19
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,917
Every generation meet these characters

20
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,839
and a different take
on the Justice League.

21
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,213
And now we are seeing
the next generation

22
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,511
meeting the Justice League
through this film.

23
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,018
DiDIO: If you wanna follow
the history of Justice League,

24
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,062
it actually starts
not even with the Justice League,

25
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,434
it starts with the Justice Society.

26
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,235
The Justice Society features a lot of
the characters that existed in the 19405

27
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,062
and brought them all together
in one big story. It was more a club

28
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,444
and an organization
than a superhero team,

29
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:17,900
and it was more about sharing adventures

30
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,656
than actually going on
adventures together.

31
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,532
Then you flash fon/vard
to the late '503, early '603

32
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,742
when the Silver Age comics are starting,

33
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,078
they're reintroducing these
new interpretations of our characters.

34
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,708
So it would only seem to follow suit

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,130
that the next interpretations
of the Justice Society

36
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,924
is a new group
and this was called the Justice League.

37
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,001
It was a smash hit.

38
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,380
LEE: Brave and the Bold number 28,
Justice League number 1,

39
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,214
been around since 1960.

40
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,393
What is that? Carry the one...

41
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,937
Like, a long time. They've been around
a long, longtime. (CHUCKLES)

42
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:51,275
They came together because of
a giant starfish called Starro.

43
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,192
That was the big threat.

44
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,479
DiDIO: So you start to see
Justice League now becoming

45
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,656
an integral portion of the DC Universe.

46
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,283
The Justice League becomes the book
where all characters seem to appear.

47
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,452
So, if there's one comic
you're supposed to buy that was the one.

48
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,155
My personal favorites are those stories
which are the ones where they go out

49
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,741
and try to convince
new characters to join the team.

50
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,951
The Atom joins later.

51
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,331
Green Arrow joins later.

52
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,255
They go out there and they search out
characters like Zatanna.

53
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,957
They offer the position to Metamorpho.

54
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,338
He turns them down
'cause he doesn’t want to be a hero.

55
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,465
And they keep on introducing
new characters.

56
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,218
MORRISON: The thing that really
did it for me was the run of stories

57
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:26,348
that Len Wein wrote in the '703
which were just really great adventures.

58
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,515
What he would do, it wouldn't be

59
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,768
an adventure would finish
and then there’d be a new one.

60
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,225
There would be a new one, but there was
plot threads that ran through it

61
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,185
so it was very much
like television today

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,145
where we have an individual episode

63
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,528
but there are massive plot threads
that will run through and play out

64
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,988
and mysteries that you have to
think about and solve.

65
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,696
So, his Justice League for me
was real inspiration.

66
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,242
JOHNS: And then they did
Crisis on Infinite Earths

67
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,795
which is the famous comic book storyline
by George Pérez and Marv Wolfman.

68
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,706
Crisis came out in the mid ’803.

69
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,212
All the DC heroes, Superman, Batman,

70
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,466
Wonder Woman, Hawkman,
Green Lantern, Flash, etc, etc.,

71
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,799
you can go on forever, were all created
between 1938 and 1941.

72
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,637
Almost 50 years later, the best
characters have been continuing.

73
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,438
Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman
were published non-stop.

74
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,854
Some of the characters were starting
to get older.

75
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,027
They don ’t feel as modern anymore.

76
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,855
We needed something
to make them special again.

77
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,325
Also, DC was too confusing
for new readers.

78
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,780
It had a strange continuity, we had
this Multiverse of different planets

79
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,708
filled with multiple versions
of the superheroes.

80
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,626
You didn't know
who all the characters were.

81
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,922
And my pitch was, let's start with
getting rid of the Multiverse.

82
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,420
Let's bring it down
to our basic characters.

83
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,672
Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,
one of each.

84
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,254
Let’s think about what works
and what doesn’t work

85
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,512
and how can we make it work now
for 1985?

86
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,899
JOHNS: When Crisis came out,
they relaunched a lot of titles.

87
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,601
Superman and Wonder Woman and Flash,

88
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,777
but also Justice League with
Giffen, DeMatteis and Kevin Maguire.

89
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:05,359
It was not the usual team
you saw and the tone of it was funny.

90
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,571
There was a lot of humor to it.
It was this weird mix of characters

91
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,280
and from the outside
it was like, oh, wow,

92
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,990
they're trying to do something new.

93
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,165
It was wonderful.

94
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,209
People really liked it.
They were going against the trend

95
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,582
of grim and gritty comics.

96
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,789
It was a great take on the team.
And it was cool

97
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,717
to see these strange characters together
that we 'd never seen come together

98
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,792
and form the Justice League.

99
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,674
And so for years and years and years,

100
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,302
the Justice League was never
the Big Seven, as they called them.

101
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,514
Then you flash forward
to Midsummer’s Nightmare

102
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,097
which is really
a standalone, independent story.

103
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,059
And that’s the first time you see
the seven interacting again.

104
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,236
And lo and behold, the reaction
from the fan base is very strong.

105
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,156
Then ultimately that gets you to
the big launch point which is JLA.

106
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,824
When Grant Morrison takes hold
of the book and really takes

107
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,868
all the primary characters,
puts them together,

108
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,866
creates villains and situations
that really

109
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,573
are worthy of bringing
those seven characters together.

110
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,163
MORRISON: When I committed to it,

111
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,745
I said, can we bring back
the Big Seven Justice League?

112
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,545
Can we focus on giant scale adventures
that only they could deal with?

113
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,294
The big idea I had, though,
was that the Justice League

114
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,845
was so close to the
Greek pantheon of gods.

115
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,141
Let's make a point of that,
let's actually assign them, you know?

116
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,890
The Flash is Hermes. Superman is Zeus.
Batman is Hades.

117
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,345
And it really ﬁts beautifully

118
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,931
'cause the DC characters
are such big archetypes.

119
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,438
What I could then do was go back to the
Iliad or the Odyssey

120
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,614
or to Celtic or Norse myths and there
was such a great wealth of stuff

121
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,818
that could be adapted
or science fictionalized or recreated.

122
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,528
So I think that was
what I brought to it,

123
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,955
a sense of grandeur, a sense of scope

124
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,784
and the fact that these characters
could reach out to every single corner

125
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,961
of the DC Universe
and explore it in a new way.

126
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,540
LEE: If you go back to the earliest
stories of the Justice League,

127
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,126
there wasn't a lot of conflict
between the characters.

128
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,554
It wasn't until later
that modern creators came in

129
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,474
and decided if we bring more conflict
between these characters,

130
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,591
even though they're heroes,

131
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:58,476
it makes for a more interesting story.
It makes for a more interesting team.

132
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,728
Because it more resembles real life.

133
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,608
MORRISON: We tried to position
them as professionals

134
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,732
even though they would
sometimes disagree or fall out.

135
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,484
It was all about,
"Let's get the job done. "

136
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:10,033
And I used to love the interplay
of using all those powers together

137
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,573
to defeat an enemy
that seemed undefeatable.

138
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,991
But if you combine those skills,

139
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,824
and if you're smart enough
to get the recipe right,

140
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,539
then the Justice League can pretty much
solve any problem.

141
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,119
You do this and you do that

142
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,125
and you do this
and we’ll save the world.

143
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,922
That's probably my favorite
run of all time.

144
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,547
It was really a special time
for Justice League.

145
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,636
LEE: The New 52 was a big publishing
initiative we launched in 2011,

146
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,011
where we basically looked
at the entire DC Universe and said,

147
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,017
if we could start over,
how would we do it?

148
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,898
And so one of the ﬁrst things we could
do was redefine the Justice League,

149
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,322
what brought these characters together,
and really show readers

150
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,448
the first glimpses of the interactions
of the world’s greatest superheroes

151
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,903
and do it in a realistic way

152
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,865
where we showcase the differences
between the personalities.

153
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:02,495
We were back to the team. It was Batman,
Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman,

154
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,376
Green Lantern. And that's the first time
we brought in Cyborg.

155
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:09,051
That's the core team we started with
and kind of went back to the basics.

156
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,801
Over the years there's been a lot
of changes but it always comes back,

157
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,758
no matter how many changes happen
in the comic books,

158
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,764
it always comes back to,
these are the original characters.

159
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,147
JOHNS: My love for DC Comics,

160
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,071
and speciﬁcally
superheroes ’cause I’m all things DC,

161
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,692
comes from Super Friends which was
this Saturday morning animated series.

162
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,698
LEE: Back then all we really had
was animation

163
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,371
so the Super Friends
was the closest thing we had

164
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,540
to seeing the Justice League
come to life

165
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,663
'cause you could see them move
and they talked

166
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:47,248
and they interacted and they had
a theme song and that’s what made me

167
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:51,676
go outside and put a towel around
my neck and run around like a dork.

168
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:56,181
It was done under really restrictive
TV broadcast standards and practices.

169
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,009
They were not allowed to show characters
punching other characters,

170
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,846
so any kind of action they had,
it was more like,

171
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,148
Superman would ﬁght a tornado
rather than fight another villain.

172
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,022
There were things like that
which kept it from its full potential.

173
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:11,905
TIMM: When we came along and did

174
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,948
our Justice League show
in the early 20003...

175
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,446
It gave you a chance to take something
that was like a static image on a comic

176
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,657
and bring it into
cinematic kind of storytelling.

177
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,994
After we had done two seasons
ofJustice League,

178
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,545
Cartoon Network said, "Yeah, we would
like you guys to do another season.

179
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,748
But we want to rebrand
the show somehow."

180
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,884
I came up with this name,
Justice League Unlimited.

181
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,928
And I thought, what does that mean?
And that basically means

182
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,098
instead of having
just seven superpowered characters,

183
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,267
now we've got 50 some odd
superpowered characters.

184
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,230
Basically, any character
in the DC Universe is now

185
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,681
automatically a member
of the Justice League.

186
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,563
But it allowed us to kinda
dig deeper into the DC bench,

187
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,020
so that we could use
characters like The Question,

188
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,777
and Hawk and Dove, and Captain Atom.

189
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,860
Characters who are
interesting to us as comic book fans.

190
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,240
And they weren't necessarily
household names as the other characters.

191
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,823
But it was something that allowed us
to expand the scope of the show.

192
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,743
And it turned out to be
quite a big hit with the fans.

193
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,454
I always say it was my favorite show
of all the shows I’ve ever worked on.

194
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,585
Because every episode was different
than every other episode.

195
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,634
And then, doing the Justice League
as a series of feature-length movies,

196
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,683
it's interesting, it kinda gives us
a little more of a narrow focus

197
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,853
in terms of, instead of having
season-long story arcs,

198
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,021
we ’re basically telling
movie-length stories,

199
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,440
with still a pretty large ensemble cast.

200
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,018
So, it's tricky from
a storytelling standpoint

201
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,446
to make sure that
each character is there for a reason.

202
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,567
It’s really tough to accommodate
seven lead characters.

203
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,367
We always do try to balance it out.

204
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,820
You wanna make sure
they at least get one

205
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,655
really good action sequence in the film.

206
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,911
It’s a juggling act,
it's a challenge.

207
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,837
-How many of you are there?
-Not enough.

208
00:09:54,969 --> 00:10:01,215
SNYDER: It's challenging to have
all these amazing superheroes

209
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,017
together on the screen
to tell this big, epic story

210
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,596
with action and spectacle,

211
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,898
but also a lot of character.

212
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,192
And I think Zack does an amazing job
balancing all of that out.

213
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,190
Wait until the camera comes around Ben.

214
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,772
SNYDER: It is super exciting
to finally bring

215
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,233
all these superheroes,
the Justice League,

216
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,068
to the screen for the first time.

217
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,781
-This is amazing.
-This is crazy.

218
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,908
FISHER: The day we were all up
on the wall for the first time,

219
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,416
it was like watching
my 8-year-old dreams come true.

220
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,713
It took me back to those days
watching the cartoons,

221
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,758
I almost shed a tear, I will say
I held it together pretty good.

222
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:37,880
It's groundbreaking.

223
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,212
Wow, it's like a cave!

224
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,594
Like a Batcave.

225
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,975
MILLER: lswearl've been
blacking out and entering comic frames.

226
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,054
Barry.

227
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,146
MILLER: And living in the world
of this invented universe,

228
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,479
and then coming to like,
"Whoa, where am I?"

229
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,940
It's very hard to describe the feeling,

230
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,526
when you look out
and you see thatAlex Ross painting.

231
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,283
And you see it in front of you,
and it's these real people.

232
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,205
It's so amazing!

233
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,579
He's back!

234
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:14,295
I had this moment the other day on set
where I looked up and I saw

235
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:18,000
Jason, Gal, and Ben,
and Ezra, and Ray there,

236
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,507
and I thought, "This is a piece of
history happening right now.

237
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,338
And I'm lucky enough
to be a part of it."

238
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,765
Well, I knew you didn't bring me back
'cause you liked me.

239
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,225
I don't not...

240
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:32,272
AFFLECK: It's interesting, because
pop culture has chewed up and spit out

241
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,145
so many pop icons
over the years.

242
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,772
That's part of what pop culture does,

243
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,731
is sort of consume
characters and icons and ideas.

244
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,070
And you start with them
looking cool and interesting,

245
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,152
and when it's done with them
they seem retro,

246
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,238
then they seem just absurd and goofy
and hopelessly dated.

247
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:53,043
And lot of these core DC characters
still don ’t seem dated.

248
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,745
They somehow still work
in stories today.

249
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,083
And I think that's just the mark
of characters that are very well drawn,

250
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,169
that they still have
this kind of resonance.

251
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,887
LEE: The fun and beauty
of comic books is that,

252
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,012
when it’s a shared universe,

253
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,974
you're really standing on the shoulders
of these creative giants before you.

254
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,181
And everyone acknowledges
and understands

255
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,893
that their ideas will be used,
and change and evolve

256
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,229
to kind of further this giant storyline
that we're all creating.

257
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,313
My man!

258
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,273
DiDIO: As comic book storytellers,
we 've been telling the stories

259
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,984
for these characters
for over 50 years.

260
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,485
So there '3 so many stories out there,

261
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,071
so many great touchpoints
for people to tap into

262
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,372
and pull the ideas out

263
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,415
and mold and create it
to what works best

264
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,915
for whatever medium.
What works best for television.

265
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,290
What works best for the screen,

266
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,122
so I’m gonna be interested
where they take them.

267
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,921
We should always have new versions,

268
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,253
we should always make the books
relevant to the current generation.

269
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,388
Keep the characters up-to-date.

270
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,308
Don't let them become
your granddaddy's superhero.

271
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,428
You need characters
who will reflect the modern age.

272
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,684
-S|owpoke.
-Oh, it's on.

273
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,640
CHARLES ROVEN: I’ve been really blessed

274
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:03,989
to be part of the evolution
of the DC Universe.

275
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,065
You have these characters,

276
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,027
and you get to play
with their motivations.

277
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:13,161
And as long as you honor the canon,
there's still a lot left that you can do

278
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,286
and that’s a lot of fun.

279
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,117
Big round table.

280
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,918
Six chairs, right there.

281
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,130
But room for more.

282
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,458
But room for more.
