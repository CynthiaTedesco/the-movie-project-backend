1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,501
Minions!

2
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,307
Minions have been on this planet
far longer than we have.

3
00:00:17,557 --> 00:00:19,024
They go by many names.

4
00:00:19,274 --> 00:00:20,859
Dave, Carl,

5
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:22,657
that one is Norbit.

6
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:24,482
He's an idiot.

7
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:26,234
They all share the same goal.

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,446
To serve

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,990
the most despicable master around.

10
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,665
Finding a master was easy.

11
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,920
Keeping a master...
That's where things got tricky.

12
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:50,000
But nonetheless,
they kept on looking.

13
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,204
Without a master,
they had no purpose.

14
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:23,875
They became aimless.

15
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,335
And depressed.

16
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:29,381
If this went on much longer,

17
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,341
they would surely perish.

18
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,127
But then
one minion stepped forward.

19
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,653
Kevin felt pride!

20
00:01:36,903 --> 00:01:39,160
He was going to be the one
to find his tribe

21
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,934
the biggest,
baddest villain to serve.

22
00:01:42,184 --> 00:01:44,737
Stuart felt hungry mostly, 

23
00:01:44,987 --> 00:01:46,982
he was going to
be the one to eat this banana.

24
00:01:47,768 --> 00:01:48,900
And bob...

25
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,778
Bob was frightened
of the journey ahead.

26
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,792
