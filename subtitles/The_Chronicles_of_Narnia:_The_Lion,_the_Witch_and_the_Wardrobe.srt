1
00:01:38,693 --> 00:01:41,476
Edmund! Get away from there!

2
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,285
Peter! What do you think you're doing?

3
00:01:44,294 --> 00:01:46,062
Peter, quickly, the shelter. Now!

4
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:47,385
- Come on!
- Wait...

5
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:49,088
Come on, leave it!

6
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:53,821
Mommy!

7
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:57,370
Lucy, come on!

8
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:00,602
- Come on, quickly!
- Run!

9
00:02:01,227 --> 00:02:03,029
Run!

10
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:05,981
- Hurry!
- Mum!

11
00:02:06,342 --> 00:02:08,879
- Wait! Dad!
- Ed!

12
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,591
- Edmund, no!
- I'll get him!

13
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,942
- Peter, come back!
- Ed! Come here!

14
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:17,968
Edmund! Get down!

15
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:20,904
Come on, you idiot, run!

16
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:22,697
Get out!

17
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:30,391
Come on!

18
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:33,815
Hurry!

19
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:38,066
Why can't you think of anyone
but yourself? You're so selfish!

20
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:41,259
- You could've got us killed!
- Stop it!

21
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:51,086
Why can't you just do as you're told?

22
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:11,682
You need to keep this on, darling.
All right?

23
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:13,990
You warm enough? Good girl.

24
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,721
If Dad were here,
he wouldn't make us go.

25
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:24,585
If Dad were here, it'd mean the war
was over and we wouldn't have to.

26
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,289
You will listen to your brother,
won't you, Edmund?

27
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:45,231
Promise me you'll look after the others.

28
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,820
I will, Mum.

29
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,096
- Good man.
- All aboard! All aboard!

30
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:59,889
Susan.

31
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:03,500
Be a big girl.

32
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:11,765
All right. Off you go.

33
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,944
Hey, get off. I know
how to get on a train by myself.

34
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,543
Get off me!

35
00:04:27,582 --> 00:04:30,522
May I have your tickets, please?
Tickets, please.

36
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,401
Peter.

37
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:44,106
Come on, Lucy.
We have to stick together now.

38
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:49,150
Everything's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be fine.

39
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:09,477
- Bye-bye, dear.
- Bye! We'll miss you! See you soon.

40
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:31,373
The professor knew we were coming.

41
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:35,515
Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled.

42
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:39,143
Come on, hup!

43
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,657
And whoa. Whoa.

44
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,835
- Mrs. Macready?
- I'm afraid so.

45
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:59,778
Is this it, then?
Haven't you brought anything else?

46
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:02,316
No, ma'am.

47
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:04,340
It's just us.

48
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:08,542
Small favors.

49
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:14,360
Come on.
Good girl. Come on. Come on.

50
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:32,052
Professor Kirke is not accustomed
to havin' children in this house.

51
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,520
And, as such, there are a few rules
we need to follow.

52
00:08:36,624 --> 00:08:38,479
There will no shoutin'.

53
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,600
Or runnin'.
No improper use of the dumbwaiter.

54
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:46,050
No touchin' of the historical artifacts!

55
00:08:48,907 --> 00:08:50,636
And above all,

56
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:56,235
there shall be no disturbin'
of the professor.

57
00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:19,451
The sheets feel scratchy.

58
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:25,469
Wars don't last forever, Lucy.
We'll be home soon.

59
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:29,503
- Yeah, if home's still there.
- Isn't it time you were in bed?

60
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,242
- Yes, Mum.
- Ed!

61
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,708
You saw outside.
This place is huge.

62
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:40,503
We can do whatever we want here.

63
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:43,379
Tomorrow's going to be great.

64
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:44,951
Really.

65
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:53,601
"Gastrovascular."

66
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:58,435
Come on, Peter. Gastrovascular.

67
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,731
- Is it Latin?
- Yes.

68
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:05,161
Is it Latin for
"worst game ever invented"?

69
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,060
We could play hide and seek.

70
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:14,747
But we're already having so much fun.

71
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,737
Come on, Peter, please.

72
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,858
Pretty please?

73
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:25,545
- One, two, three, four...
- What?

74
00:10:26,152 --> 00:10:29,069
...five, six, seven, eight,

75
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,569
nine, ten, eleven...

76
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:49,487
...24, 25, 26...

77
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:06,550
I was here first!

78
00:15:23,644 --> 00:15:26,111
Were you hiding from me?

79
00:15:30,665 --> 00:15:32,194
No.

80
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,848
Uh, well...

81
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,145
I just... I...

82
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:39,606
No. No. I-I-I just...

83
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,260
I was just, um...
I didn't want to scare you.

84
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:50,212
If you don't mind my asking...
what are you?

85
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:53,733
Well, I'm a...
Well, I'm a faun.

86
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,156
And what about you?

87
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,460
You must be some kind of
beardless dwarf?

88
00:15:58,496 --> 00:16:03,234
I'm not a dwarf! I'm a girl!

89
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:07,825
And, actually, I'm tallest in my class.

90
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:14,373
You mean to say that
you're a Daughter of Eve?

91
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:16,498
Well, my mum's name is Helen.

92
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:21,469
Yes, but you are in fact human.

93
00:16:21,946 --> 00:16:24,936
Yes, of course.

94
00:16:26,378 --> 00:16:28,074
What are you doing here?

95
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:31,612
Well, I was hiding in the wardrobe
in the spare room, and...

96
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:33,794
Spare Oom? Is that in Narnia?

97
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:36,514
Narnia? What's that?

98
00:16:37,144 --> 00:16:39,777
Well, dear girl,
you're in it.

99
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,567
Everything from the lamppost

100
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:46,269
all the way to Castle Cair Paravel
on the Eastern Ocean,

101
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,563
every stick and stone you see,

102
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:52,311
every icicle is Narnia.

103
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:57,547
This is an awfully big wardrobe.

104
00:16:57,637 --> 00:17:00,519
War Drobe? I'm sorry.

105
00:17:00,538 --> 00:17:04,098
Please allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Tumnus.

106
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:08,202
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus.
I'm Lucy Pevensie.

107
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,976
- Oh, you shake it.
- Uh... Why?

108
00:17:16,978 --> 00:17:19,574
I... I don't know.

109
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:22,247
People do it when they meet each other.

110
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:36,549
Well, then, Lucy Pevensie
from the shining city of War Drobe

111
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:39,573
in the wondrous land of Spare Oom,

112
00:17:39,723 --> 00:17:44,385
how would it be if you came
and had tea with me?

113
00:17:44,422 --> 00:17:46,847
Well, thank you very much, but I...

114
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:50,425
I probably should be getting back.

115
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:54,877
It's only just around the corner.
And there'll be a glorious fire

116
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:58,483
with toast and tea and cakes.

117
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,800
And, perhaps, we'll even
break into the sardines.

118
00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:06,225
- I don't know.
- Come on.

119
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,024
It's not every day
that I get to make a new friend.

120
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,908
Well, I suppose I could come
for a little while.

121
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:16,660
If you have sardines.

122
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:19,815
By the bucketload.

123
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:33,743
- You all right?
- Mm-hm.

124
00:18:41,342 --> 00:18:42,896
Well, here we are.

125
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:45,487
Come along.

126
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,097
- After you.
- May I help you with that?

127
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,979
- Thank you very much.
- Oh.

128
00:19:13,397 --> 00:19:15,686
Now, that... that is my father.

129
00:19:17,354 --> 00:19:19,572
He has a nice face.

130
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:21,229
He looks a lot like you.

131
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,435
No.

132
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:27,632
No, I'm not very much
like him at all, really.

133
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,212
My father's fighting in the war.

134
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:36,123
My father went away to war too.

135
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:40,492
But that was a long, long time ago.

136
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:44,753
- Before this dreadful winter.
- Winter's not all bad.

137
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:49,439
There's ice skating and snowball fights.

138
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,986
- Oh! And Christmas!
- Not here.

139
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:58,134
No. No, we haven't had a Christmas
in a hundred years.

140
00:19:58,487 --> 00:20:02,377
What? No presents for a hundred years?

141
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:04,680
Always winter, never Christmas.

142
00:20:04,686 --> 00:20:07,675
It's been a long winter.

143
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:12,270
But you would have loved Narnia
in summer.

144
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:16,368
We fauns danced
with the dryads all night,

145
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:20,103
and, you know, we never got tired.

146
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,251
And music. Oh, such music!

147
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:29,231
Would... would you
like to hear some now?

148
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:33,084
Oh! Yes, please.

149
00:20:37,094 --> 00:20:40,402
Now, are you familiar

150
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:44,281
- with any Narnian lullabies?
- Sorry, no.

151
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:46,499
Well, that's good.

152
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:52,041
Because this... probably
won't sound anything like one.

153
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:19,116
- Oh, I should go.
- It's too late for that now.

154
00:22:21,303 --> 00:22:23,841
I'm such a terrible faun.

155
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,117
Oh, no.

156
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:32,276
You're the nicest faun I've ever met.

157
00:22:32,338 --> 00:22:36,051
Then I'm afraid you've had
a very poor sampling.

158
00:22:36,895 --> 00:22:41,581
You can't have done
anything that bad.

159
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:46,500
It's not something I have done,
Lucy Pevensie.

160
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:49,283
It's something I am doing.

161
00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:51,096
What are you doing?

162
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:55,259
I'm kidnapping you.

163
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:56,556
It was the White Witch.

164
00:22:56,802 --> 00:22:59,649
She's the one who makes it
always winter, always cold.

165
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:01,444
She gave orders.

166
00:23:01,455 --> 00:23:04,522
If any of us ever find a human
wandering in the woods,

167
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:06,953
we're supposed to turn it over to her.

168
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:11,304
But, Mr. Tumnus, you wouldn't.

169
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,305
I thought you were my friend.

170
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,221
Now. She may already know you're here.

171
00:23:26,258 --> 00:23:28,997
The woods are full of her spies.

172
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:34,794
Even some of the trees are on her side.

173
00:23:38,477 --> 00:23:41,217
Can you find your way back from here?

174
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:44,660
- I think so.
- All right.

175
00:23:47,713 --> 00:23:51,675
Will you be all right?

176
00:23:55,757 --> 00:23:58,678
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

177
00:24:01,694 --> 00:24:03,532
Here.

178
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:09,222
Keep it. You need it more than I do.

179
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:14,916
No matter what happens,
Lucy Pevensie,

180
00:24:15,015 --> 00:24:17,553
I am glad to have met you.

181
00:24:18,072 --> 00:24:21,263
You've made me feel warmer
than I've felt in a hundred years.

182
00:24:22,313 --> 00:24:23,866
Now go.

183
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,852
Go!

184
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:43,182
It's all right! I'm back! I'm all right!

185
00:24:43,604 --> 00:24:46,071
Shut up! He's coming!

186
00:24:49,342 --> 00:24:52,888
You know, I'm not sure you two
have quite got the idea of this game.

187
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:55,717
Weren't you wondering where I was?

188
00:24:55,831 --> 00:24:58,709
That's the point.
That was why he was seeking you.

189
00:24:58,746 --> 00:25:00,097
Does this mean I win?

190
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:01,995
I don't think Lucy
wants to play anymore.

191
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:04,568
I've been gone for hours.

192
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:22,218
Lucy, the only wood in here
is the back of the wardrobe.

193
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:26,559
One game at a time, Lu.
We don't all have your imagination.

194
00:25:30,503 --> 00:25:33,729
But I wasn't imagining!

195
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:35,573
That's enough, Lucy.

196
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,403
I wouldn't lie about this!

197
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:40,317
Well, I believe you.

198
00:25:40,384 --> 00:25:42,958
- You do?
- Yeah, of course.

199
00:25:43,314 --> 00:25:45,947
Didn't I tell you about
the field in the cupboards?

200
00:25:46,163 --> 00:25:48,381
Will you just stop?

201
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:50,586
You just have to make
everything worse, don't you?

202
00:25:50,623 --> 00:25:53,611
- It was just a joke!
- When are you gonna learn to grow up?

203
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:57,123
Shut up! You think you're Dad,
but you're not!

204
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:03,399
Well, that was nicely handled.

205
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:10,049
But... it really was there.

206
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:12,918
Susan's right, Lucy.

207
00:26:12,955 --> 00:26:14,900
That's enough.

208
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,044
Lucy.

209
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,069
Where are you?

210
00:27:57,287 --> 00:27:58,911
Boo!

211
00:28:05,523 --> 00:28:07,575
Lucy.

212
00:28:09,413 --> 00:28:11,916
Hope you're not afraid of the dark.

213
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:19,701
Lucy?

214
00:28:25,428 --> 00:28:27,337
Lucy?

215
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:29,917
Lucy!

216
00:28:48,636 --> 00:28:50,545
Lucy.

217
00:28:51,412 --> 00:28:53,393
Where are you?

218
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,927
Lucy.

219
00:28:57,873 --> 00:29:00,376
I think I believe you now.

220
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:28,031
Lucy.

221
00:29:44,485 --> 00:29:45,730
Lucy?

222
00:30:15,306 --> 00:30:17,975
- Leave me alone!
- What is it now, Ginarrbrik?

223
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:20,373
Make him let me go!
I didn't do anything wrong!

224
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,954
How dare you address
the Queen of Narnia?

225
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:24,293
I didn't know!

226
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,449
- You will know her better hereafter!
- Wait!

227
00:30:38,222 --> 00:30:41,412
What is your name, Son of Adam?

228
00:30:41,888 --> 00:30:44,213
Uh, Edmund.

229
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,849
And how, Edmund,
did you come to enter my dominion?

230
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,234
I'm not sure.
I was just following my sister.

231
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:56,309
- Your sister? How many are you?
- Four.

232
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:58,680
Lucy's the only one
that's been here before.

233
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,239
She said she met some faun
called Tumnus.

234
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,943
Peter and Susan didn't believe her.
I didn't either.

235
00:31:06,134 --> 00:31:10,997
Edmund, you look so cold.
Will you come and sit with me?

236
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:29,518
Now, how about something hot to drink?

237
00:31:30,463 --> 00:31:34,247
Yes, please, Your Majesty.

238
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,235
Your drink, sire.

239
00:31:54,482 --> 00:31:56,448
How did you do that?

240
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,752
I can make anything you like.

241
00:31:59,689 --> 00:32:02,287
Can you make me taller?

242
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:06,042
Anything you'd like to eat.

243
00:32:06,434 --> 00:32:08,723
Turkish delight?

244
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:36,297
Edmund?

245
00:32:36,629 --> 00:32:39,196
I would very much like to meet
the rest of your family.

246
00:32:39,596 --> 00:32:41,249
Why?

247
00:32:41,911 --> 00:32:44,378
They're nothing special.

248
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:51,383
Oh, I'm sure they're not nearly
as delightful as you are.

249
00:32:51,615 --> 00:32:55,814
But you see, Edmund,
I have no children of my own.

250
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:58,198
And you are exactly the sort of boy

251
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:03,808
who I could see, one day,
becoming Prince of Narnia.

252
00:33:03,952 --> 00:33:06,313
Maybe even King.

253
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:09,013
Really?

254
00:33:09,772 --> 00:33:12,369
Of course, you'd have
to bring your family.

255
00:33:12,415 --> 00:33:13,263
Oh.

256
00:33:13,996 --> 00:33:17,573
Do you mean,
Peter would be king too?

257
00:33:17,731 --> 00:33:20,358
No! No, no.

258
00:33:20,993 --> 00:33:24,148
But a king needs servants.

259
00:33:25,432 --> 00:33:27,970
I guess I could bring 'em.

260
00:33:31,852 --> 00:33:35,064
Beyond these woods,
you see those two hills?

261
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:38,326
My house is right between them.

262
00:33:38,437 --> 00:33:40,159
You'd love it there, Edmund.

263
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:44,855
It has whole rooms
simply stuffed with Turkish delight.

264
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:48,793
- Couldn't I have some more now?
- No!

265
00:33:50,536 --> 00:33:52,932
Don't want to ruin your appetite.

266
00:33:53,254 --> 00:33:57,138
Besides, you and I are going to be
seeing each other again very soon.

267
00:33:57,175 --> 00:34:00,057
I hope so, Your Majesty.

268
00:34:00,494 --> 00:34:05,085
Until then, dear one.
Mmm, I'm gonna miss you.

269
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,702
Edmund?

270
00:34:21,027 --> 00:34:23,909
Oh, Edmund! You got in too!

271
00:34:24,024 --> 00:34:24,908
Isn't it wonderful?

272
00:34:26,138 --> 00:34:30,516
- Where have you been?
- With Mr. Tumnus. He's fine.

273
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:34,833
The White Witch hasn't found out
anything about him meeting me.

274
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:36,147
The White Witch?

275
00:34:37,338 --> 00:34:41,407
She calls herself the Queen of Narnia,
but she really isn't.

276
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:45,444
Are you all right? You look awful.

277
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:49,368
Well, what'd you expect?
I mean, it's freezing.

278
00:34:49,872 --> 00:34:52,599
- How do we get out of here?
- Come on.

279
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:54,991
This way.

280
00:34:57,684 --> 00:35:00,234
Peter, Peter, wake up!
Peter, wake up!

281
00:35:00,271 --> 00:35:02,209
- It's there! It's really there!
- Shh.

282
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:04,672
- Lucy, what are you talking about?
- Narnia!

283
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:07,015
It's all in the wardrobe
like I told you!

284
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,880
- You've just been dreaming, Lucy.
- But I haven't!

285
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:14,481
I saw Mr. Tumnus again!
And this time Edmund went too.

286
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:20,423
You... You saw the faun?

287
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:27,444
Well, he didn't actually
go there with me.

288
00:35:28,634 --> 00:35:31,339
He...

289
00:35:33,761 --> 00:35:35,873
What were you doing, Edmund?

290
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,262
I was just playing along.

291
00:35:41,155 --> 00:35:42,684
I'm sorry, Peter.

292
00:35:42,832 --> 00:35:44,913
I shouldn't have encouraged her,

293
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:47,937
but you know what little children
are like these days.

294
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,662
They just don't know
when to stop pretending.

295
00:36:09,552 --> 00:36:13,336
You children are one shenanigan
shy of sleepin' in the stable!

296
00:36:14,669 --> 00:36:20,891
Professor. I'm sorry. I told them
you were not to be disturbed.

297
00:36:20,927 --> 00:36:23,441
It's all right, Mrs. Macready.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

298
00:36:25,638 --> 00:36:29,161
But first of all, I think this one
is in need of a little hot chocolate.

299
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:30,189
Come along, dear.

300
00:36:39,168 --> 00:36:43,665
You seem to have upset the delicate
internal balance of my housekeeper.

301
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:46,592
We're very sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

302
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:49,693
It's our sister, sir. Lucy.

303
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,944
- The weeping girl.
- Yes, sir.

304
00:36:52,303 --> 00:36:55,080
- She's upset.
- Hence the weeping.

305
00:36:55,428 --> 00:36:56,699
It's nothing.

306
00:36:57,346 --> 00:36:59,574
- We can handle it.
- Oh, I can see that.

307
00:37:02,135 --> 00:37:03,898
She thinks she's found a magical land.

308
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,649
In the upstairs wardrobe.

309
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,327
What did you say?

310
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:14,843
Um, the wardrobe, upstairs.

311
00:37:15,472 --> 00:37:18,010
Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.

312
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:20,581
She won't stop going on about it.

313
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,746
- What was it like?
- Like talking to a lunatic.

314
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:27,070
No, no, no, not her.
The forest.

315
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:30,535
- You're not saying you believe her?
- You don't?

316
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,496
But of course not.

317
00:37:32,607 --> 00:37:34,568
I mean, logically, it's impossible.

318
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,445
What do they teach in schools
these days?

319
00:37:38,229 --> 00:37:40,046
Edmund said they were only pretending.

320
00:37:40,352 --> 00:37:42,357
He's usually the more
truthful one, is he?

321
00:37:42,535 --> 00:37:45,835
No. This would be the first time.

322
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,706
Well, if she's not mad
and she's not lying,

323
00:37:47,907 --> 00:37:52,388
then logically we must assume
she's telling the truth.

324
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:56,347
You're saying that we
should just believe her?

325
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,776
She's your sister, isn't she?
You're her family.

326
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:06,560
You might just try acting like one.

327
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:12,291
Peter winds up,
poised to take yet another wicket!

328
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,750
Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream.

329
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:20,639
Why can't we play hide and seek again?

330
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:22,950
I thought you said it was a kid's game.

331
00:38:23,586 --> 00:38:27,577
Besides, we could all use the fresh air.

332
00:38:27,636 --> 00:38:30,053
It's not like there isn't air inside.

333
00:38:30,928 --> 00:38:33,382
- Are you ready?
- Are you?

334
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:54,152
- Well done, Ed.
- You bowled it!

335
00:38:54,352 --> 00:38:56,581
- What on earth is goin' on?
- The Macready!

336
00:38:56,618 --> 00:38:57,799
Come on!

337
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:07,815
No, no, back, back, back!

338
00:39:33,912 --> 00:39:37,610
- Come on!
- Oh, you've got to be joking.

339
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:51,345
Get back!

340
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,338
- My toe!
- I'm not on your toe!

341
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:57,294
- Move back.
- Will you stop shoving?

342
00:40:11,103 --> 00:40:13,073
lmpossible.

343
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:15,562
Don't worry.

344
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,794
I'm sure it's just your imagination.

345
00:40:19,936 --> 00:40:22,752
I don't suppose
saying we're sorry

346
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,094
- would quite cover it.
- No. It wouldn't.

347
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:30,118
- But that might!
- Oh!

348
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,507
Ow!

349
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,719
Stop it!

350
00:40:44,223 --> 00:40:45,736
You little liar.

351
00:40:45,766 --> 00:40:49,559
- You didn't believe her, either.
- Apologize to Lucy.

352
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:55,680
- Say you're sorry.
- All right! I'm sorry.

353
00:40:55,782 --> 00:40:56,825
That's all right.

354
00:40:57,725 --> 00:41:00,547
Some children just don't know
when to stop pretending.

355
00:41:00,816 --> 00:41:02,296
Oh, very funny.

356
00:41:02,351 --> 00:41:03,590
Maybe we should go back.

357
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:06,392
But shouldn't we at least
take a look around?

358
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:09,665
I think Lucy should decide.

359
00:41:10,763 --> 00:41:13,443
I'd like you all to meet Mr. Tumnus!

360
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:16,317
Well, then Mr. Tumnus it is.

361
00:41:17,636 --> 00:41:20,544
But we can't go hiking in the snow
dressed like this.

362
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:22,190
No.

363
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:27,204
But I'm sure the professor
wouldn't mind us using these.

364
00:41:27,422 --> 00:41:31,113
Anyway, if you think about it logically,

365
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:34,266
we're not even taking them
out of the wardrobe.

366
00:41:34,474 --> 00:41:37,285
- But that's a girl's coat!
- I know.

367
00:42:21,935 --> 00:42:25,484
...lots and lots of lovely food,
and we'll have lots and lots of...

368
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:30,253
Lu?

369
00:42:31,923 --> 00:42:33,211
Lucy!

370
00:42:50,996 --> 00:42:53,740
Who would do something like this?

371
00:43:11,774 --> 00:43:14,809
"The Faun Tumnus is hereby charged

372
00:43:15,017 --> 00:43:18,930
with High Treason
against Her lmperial Majesty,

373
00:43:19,153 --> 00:43:21,869
Jadis, Queen of Narnia,

374
00:43:22,088 --> 00:43:25,544
for comforting her enemies
and fraternizing with humans.

375
00:43:25,826 --> 00:43:28,688
Signed Maugrim,
Captain of the Secret Police.

376
00:43:29,404 --> 00:43:31,735
Long Live the Queen."

377
00:43:32,345 --> 00:43:36,046
All right.
Now we really should go back.

378
00:43:36,226 --> 00:43:37,991
But what about Mr. Tumnus?

379
00:43:38,195 --> 00:43:40,023
If he was arrested just
for being with a human,

380
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:44,469
- I don't think there's much we can do.
- You don't understand, do you?

381
00:43:45,493 --> 00:43:47,215
I'm the human.

382
00:43:48,141 --> 00:43:50,589
She must have found out
he helped me.

383
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:53,821
- Maybe we could call the police.
- These are the police.

384
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:56,462
Don't worry, Lu.
We'll think of something.

385
00:43:56,783 --> 00:43:58,001
Why?

386
00:43:58,489 --> 00:44:00,565
I mean, he's a criminal.

387
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,812
Did that bird just "psst" us?

388
00:44:51,873 --> 00:44:54,330
It... It's a beaver.

389
00:45:00,756 --> 00:45:02,095
Here, boy.

390
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:04,034
Here, boy.

391
00:45:08,513 --> 00:45:11,490
I ain't gonna smell it,
if that's what you want.

392
00:45:13,271 --> 00:45:14,388
Sorry.

393
00:45:15,377 --> 00:45:17,095
Lucy Pevensie?

394
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:23,385
Yes?

395
00:45:32,948 --> 00:45:34,906
Hey, that's the hankie
I gave to Mr. Tum...

396
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,136
Tumnus. He got it to me
just before they took him.

397
00:45:38,283 --> 00:45:39,320
Is he all right?

398
00:45:41,217 --> 00:45:43,113
Further in.

399
00:45:45,072 --> 00:45:47,457
- What are you doing?
- She's right.

400
00:45:47,832 --> 00:45:49,666
How do we know we can trust him?

401
00:45:50,727 --> 00:45:52,231
He said he knows the faun.

402
00:45:52,422 --> 00:45:56,450
He's a beaver.
He shouldn't be saying anything!

403
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:57,813
Everything all right?

404
00:45:58,128 --> 00:46:00,499
Yes. We were just talking.

405
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,536
That's better left
for safer quarters.

406
00:46:04,274 --> 00:46:06,685
He means the trees.

407
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,846
Come on. We don't want to be
caught out here after nightfall.

408
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:42,293
Ah, blimey! Looks like the old girl
has got the kettle on.

409
00:46:42,471 --> 00:46:43,693
Nice cup o' Rosy Lee.

410
00:46:44,474 --> 00:46:46,434
- It's lovely.
- It's merely a trifle.

411
00:46:46,709 --> 00:46:49,264
Still plenty to do.
Ain't quite finished it yet.

412
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:51,042
It'll look the business
when it is, though.

413
00:46:52,745 --> 00:46:56,022
Beaver, is that you?
I've been worried sick!

414
00:46:56,469 --> 00:46:59,144
If I find you've been
out with Badger again, I...

415
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:00,860
Oh!

416
00:47:01,163 --> 00:47:03,108
Well, those aren't badgers.

417
00:47:03,476 --> 00:47:07,834
Oh, I never thought
I'd live to see this day.

418
00:47:08,895 --> 00:47:12,196
Look at my fur. You couldn't
give me ten minutes warning?

419
00:47:12,442 --> 00:47:14,780
I'd have given a week
if I thought it would've helped.

420
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:17,702
Oh, come inside,

421
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,259
and we'll see if we
can't get you some food,

422
00:47:19,608 --> 00:47:22,249
and some civilized company.

423
00:47:23,995 --> 00:47:25,850
Now, careful. Watch your step.

424
00:47:26,265 --> 00:47:27,232
Excuse the mess.

425
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:30,365
Can't get Mr. Beaver
to get out of his chair.

426
00:47:35,393 --> 00:47:37,417
Enjoyin' the scenery, are we?

427
00:47:41,883 --> 00:47:44,458
Isn't there anything
we can do to help Tumnus?

428
00:47:44,816 --> 00:47:47,694
They'll have taken him to the Witch's.
You know what they say.

429
00:47:47,882 --> 00:47:51,333
There's few that go through
them gates that come out again.

430
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:52,716
Fish 'n' chips?

431
00:47:54,597 --> 00:47:58,607
But there is hope, dear.
Lots of hope.

432
00:47:59,075 --> 00:48:01,042
Oh, yeah,
there's a right bit more than hope!

433
00:48:02,885 --> 00:48:05,490
Aslan is on the move.

434
00:48:12,565 --> 00:48:14,102
Who's Aslan?

435
00:48:14,884 --> 00:48:16,851
Who's Aslan?

436
00:48:17,517 --> 00:48:19,302
You cheeky little blighter.

437
00:48:21,517 --> 00:48:22,638
What?

438
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,857
- You don't know, do you?
- We haven't exactly been here long.

439
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,103
Well, he's only the king
of the whole wood.

440
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:35,119
The top geezer.
The real King of Narnia.

441
00:48:35,603 --> 00:48:39,267
- He's been away for a long while.
- But he's just got back!

442
00:48:39,464 --> 00:48:41,911
And he's waitin' for you
near the Stone Table!

443
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:44,855
- He's waiting for us?
- You're bloomin' joking!

444
00:48:44,899 --> 00:48:47,679
They don't even know about the prophecy!

445
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:50,997
- Well, then...
- Look.

446
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:53,680
Aslan's return,

447
00:48:53,926 --> 00:48:57,013
Tumnus' arrest, the secret police,

448
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:59,110
it's all happening because of you!

449
00:48:59,592 --> 00:49:02,716
- You're blaming us?
- No! Not blaming.

450
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:06,599
- Thanking you.
- There's a prophecy.

451
00:49:07,252 --> 00:49:09,484
"When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone

452
00:49:09,943 --> 00:49:12,428
sits at Cair Paravel in throne,

453
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,345
the evil time will be over and done."

454
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:18,094
- That doesn't really rhyme.
- I know it don't.

455
00:49:18,393 --> 00:49:20,000
You're kinda missin' the point!

456
00:49:20,993 --> 00:49:23,103
It has long been foretold

457
00:49:23,406 --> 00:49:26,171
that two Sons of Adam
and two Daughters of Eve

458
00:49:26,366 --> 00:49:30,843
will defeat the White Witch
and restore peace to Narnia.

459
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:35,047
And you think we're the ones?

460
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,043
You'd better be, 'cause Aslan's
already fitted out your army.

461
00:49:38,229 --> 00:49:40,660
- Our army?
- Mum sent us away

462
00:49:40,802 --> 00:49:42,847
so we wouldn't get
caught up in a war.

463
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:45,687
I think you've made a mistake.

464
00:49:46,211 --> 00:49:49,492
- We're not heroes.
- We're from Finchley.

465
00:49:51,961 --> 00:49:53,958
Thank you for your hospitality.

466
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:59,393
- But we really have to go.
- No, you can't just leave!

467
00:49:59,423 --> 00:50:03,477
He's right.
We have to help Mr. Tumnus.

468
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,683
It's out of our hands.

469
00:50:05,925 --> 00:50:07,153
I'm sorry,

470
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:11,031
but it's time the four of us
were getting home. Ed?

471
00:50:12,979 --> 00:50:14,166
Ed?

472
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,412
- I'm gonna kill him.
- You may not have to.

473
00:50:20,658 --> 00:50:23,367
Has Edmund ever been to Narnia before?

474
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:50,929
Hurry!

475
00:51:11,737 --> 00:51:14,768
- Edmund!
- Shh! They'll hear you!

476
00:51:15,923 --> 00:51:17,010
No!

477
00:51:17,046 --> 00:51:19,583
- Get off!
- You're playing into her hands.

478
00:51:19,778 --> 00:51:21,826
- We can't just let him go!
- He's our brother!

479
00:51:22,016 --> 00:51:25,022
He's the bait!
The Witch wants all four of you!

480
00:51:25,192 --> 00:51:28,752
- Why?
- To stop the prophecy from coming true.

481
00:51:29,035 --> 00:51:30,687
To kill you!

482
00:51:40,545 --> 00:51:43,668
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

483
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:45,801
None of this would have happened
if you had listened to me!

484
00:51:46,431 --> 00:51:49,314
- You knew this would happen.
- I didn't know what would happen.

485
00:51:49,861 --> 00:51:51,807
Which is why we should
have left while we could!

486
00:51:51,949 --> 00:51:52,980
Stop it!

487
00:51:53,626 --> 00:51:57,516
- This isn't going to help Edmund.
- She's right.

488
00:51:58,205 --> 00:52:01,467
Only Aslan can help your brother now.

489
00:52:02,676 --> 00:52:04,336
Then take us to him.

490
00:53:14,495 --> 00:53:17,615
Be still, stranger,
or you'll never move again.

491
00:53:18,385 --> 00:53:20,082
- Who are you?
- I'm Edmund!

492
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,930
I met the Queen in the woods!
She told me to come back here!

493
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:24,812
I'm a Son of Adam!

494
00:53:25,106 --> 00:53:30,314
Hmm. My apologies,
fortunate favorite of the queen.

495
00:53:30,468 --> 00:53:33,908
Or else, not so fortunate.

496
00:53:37,899 --> 00:53:39,773
Right this way.

497
00:54:00,769 --> 00:54:02,608
Wait here.

498
00:54:41,905 --> 00:54:43,079
Like it?

499
00:54:43,552 --> 00:54:48,664
Uh... Yes, Your Majesty.

500
00:54:50,464 --> 00:54:52,646
I thought you might.

501
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,488
Tell me, Edmund...

502
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:01,144
Are your sisters deaf?

503
00:55:01,948 --> 00:55:02,617
No.

504
00:55:02,996 --> 00:55:05,950
And your brother, is he...

505
00:55:07,756 --> 00:55:09,737
...unintelligent?

506
00:55:10,564 --> 00:55:12,664
Well, I think so.
But Mum says...

507
00:55:12,817 --> 00:55:16,274
Then how dare you come alone?!

508
00:55:16,545 --> 00:55:19,313
- I tried!
- Edmund, I asked so little of you.

509
00:55:19,457 --> 00:55:22,197
- They just don't listen to me!
- You couldn't even do that.

510
00:55:22,343 --> 00:55:23,901
I did bring them halfway.

511
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,679
They're at the little house at the dam
with the Beavers.

512
00:55:33,505 --> 00:55:35,486
Well.

513
00:55:35,505 --> 00:55:39,574
I suppose you're not
a total loss then, are you?

514
00:55:42,793 --> 00:55:44,774
Well, I was wondering,

515
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:50,493
could I maybe have some more
Turkish delight now?

516
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:57,365
Our guest is hungry.

517
00:56:04,623 --> 00:56:08,229
This way for your num-nums.

518
00:56:10,197 --> 00:56:13,257
Maugrim?

519
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:17,251
You know what to do.

520
00:56:43,761 --> 00:56:44,767
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!

521
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,139
- Oh, right then.
- What's she doing?

522
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,467
Oh, you'll be thanking me later.

523
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,125
It's a long journey and Beaver
gets pretty cranky when he's hungry.

524
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,679
I'm cranky now!

525
00:56:59,065 --> 00:57:00,381
Take them.

526
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:07,260
- Do you think we'll need jam?
- Only if the Witch serves toast.

527
00:57:22,578 --> 00:57:23,609
Hurry.

528
00:57:38,446 --> 00:57:41,886
Badger and me dug this.
Comes out right near his place.

529
00:57:42,113 --> 00:57:44,438
You told me
it led to your mum's!

530
00:57:45,602 --> 00:57:47,025
Lucy!

531
00:57:48,122 --> 00:57:49,652
They're in the tunnel.

532
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:52,958
- Quick! This way.
- Hurry!

533
00:57:54,016 --> 00:57:56,018
- Run!
- Quick! Quick! Quick!

534
00:58:04,086 --> 00:58:06,319
You should have brought a map!

535
00:58:06,535 --> 00:58:08,629
There wasn't room next to the jam.

536
00:58:16,354 --> 00:58:18,892
Come on, Lucy!

537
00:58:38,022 --> 00:58:39,979
I'm so sorry, dear.

538
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:43,066
He was my best mate.

539
00:58:52,808 --> 00:58:54,089
What happened here?

540
00:58:54,288 --> 00:58:57,205
This is what becomes
of those who cross the Witch.

541
00:58:57,384 --> 00:59:01,288
You take one more step, traitor,
and I'll chew you to splinters!

542
00:59:01,324 --> 00:59:04,242
Relax. I'm one of the good guys.

543
00:59:04,312 --> 00:59:08,071
Yeah? Well, you look an awful lot
like one of the bad ones.

544
00:59:08,382 --> 00:59:10,337
An unfortunate family resemblance.

545
00:59:10,651 --> 00:59:14,001
But we can argue breeding later.
Right now we've got to move.

546
00:59:15,064 --> 00:59:17,140
What did you have in mind?

547
00:59:24,802 --> 00:59:26,499
Greetings, gents.

548
00:59:26,977 --> 00:59:30,453
- Lost something, have we?
- Don't patronize me!

549
00:59:30,814 --> 00:59:33,589
I know where your allegiance lies.

550
00:59:33,757 --> 00:59:35,251
We're looking for some humans.

551
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:39,168
Humans? Here in Narnia?

552
00:59:39,397 --> 00:59:42,034
That's a valuable bit of information,
don't you think?

553
00:59:43,567 --> 00:59:45,963
Your reward is your life.

554
00:59:46,217 --> 00:59:48,755
It's not much,

555
00:59:49,604 --> 00:59:51,098
but still.

556
00:59:51,412 --> 00:59:53,523
Where are the fugitives?

557
01:00:00,384 --> 01:00:03,480
North. They ran north.

558
01:00:04,341 --> 01:00:06,393
Smell them out.

559
01:00:16,959 --> 01:00:21,027
They were helping Tumnus.
The Witch got here before I did.

560
01:00:23,178 --> 01:00:24,637
Are you all right?

561
01:00:24,763 --> 01:00:28,025
Well, I wish I could say their bark
was worse than their bite. Ow!

562
01:00:28,426 --> 01:00:32,416
Stop squirming!
You're worse than Beaver on bath day.

563
01:00:32,452 --> 01:00:33,945
Worst day of the year.

564
01:00:34,338 --> 01:00:36,936
Thank you for your kindness,

565
01:00:37,232 --> 01:00:38,935
but that's all the cure I have time for.

566
01:00:38,971 --> 01:00:39,734
You're leaving?

567
01:00:39,933 --> 01:00:43,647
It has been a pleasure, My Queen,
and an honor, but time is short

568
01:00:43,946 --> 01:00:47,200
and Aslan himself has asked me
to gather more troops.

569
01:00:47,237 --> 01:00:49,959
- You've seen Aslan?
- What's he like?

570
01:00:51,204 --> 01:00:53,843
Like everything we've ever heard.

571
01:00:53,905 --> 01:00:57,589
You'll be glad to have him by your side
in the battle against the Witch.

572
01:00:57,899 --> 01:01:00,228
But we're not planning
on fighting any witch.

573
01:01:00,396 --> 01:01:02,915
But surely, King Peter, the prophecy!

574
01:01:03,177 --> 01:01:05,567
We can't go to war without you.

575
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:13,600
We just want our brother back.

576
01:01:38,105 --> 01:01:39,765
If...

577
01:01:41,136 --> 01:01:43,243
If you're not going to eat that...

578
01:01:49,809 --> 01:01:52,003
I'd get up, but...

579
01:01:53,154 --> 01:01:54,815
...but my legs.

580
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,976
Mr. Tumnus.

581
01:02:08,865 --> 01:02:10,638
What's left of him.

582
01:02:17,278 --> 01:02:21,174
- You're Lucy Pevensie's brother.
- I'm Edmund.

583
01:02:23,257 --> 01:02:25,487
Yes. Yes, you have the same nose.

584
01:02:30,055 --> 01:02:32,204
Is your sister all right?

585
01:02:34,245 --> 01:02:36,374
Is she safe?

586
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:42,742
I don't know.

587
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:52,907
My police tore that dam apart.

588
01:02:53,527 --> 01:02:57,489
Your little family
are nowhere to be found.

589
01:03:01,209 --> 01:03:03,922
- Where did they go?
- I don't know!

590
01:03:04,509 --> 01:03:07,666
Then you're of no further use to me.

591
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:12,185
Wait! The beaver
said something about Aslan!

592
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,796
Aslan?

593
01:03:18,718 --> 01:03:20,250
Where?

594
01:03:23,477 --> 01:03:26,257
- I...
- He's a stranger here, Your Majesty.

595
01:03:26,423 --> 01:03:27,943
He can't be expected
to know anything.

596
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:34,153
I said... where is Aslan?

597
01:03:37,538 --> 01:03:39,801
I... I don't know.

598
01:03:40,173 --> 01:03:42,403
I left before they said anything.

599
01:03:44,771 --> 01:03:46,895
I wanted to see you!

600
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:51,208
Guard!

601
01:03:51,948 --> 01:03:53,769
Your Majesty.

602
01:03:55,537 --> 01:03:57,740
Release the faun.

603
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:13,784
Do you know why you're here, faun?

604
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:19,707
Because I believe in a free Narnia.

605
01:04:21,004 --> 01:04:22,292
You're here...

606
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:27,406
...because he turned you in.

607
01:04:28,479 --> 01:04:30,887
For sweeties.

608
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,307
Take him upstairs.

609
01:04:45,142 --> 01:04:47,459
And ready my sleigh.

610
01:04:48,104 --> 01:04:50,600
Edmund misses his family.

611
01:05:13,558 --> 01:05:17,155
Now, Aslan's camp
is near the Stone Table

612
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:20,222
- just across the frozen river.
- River?

613
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,506
The river's been frozen solid
for a hundred years.

614
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:31,046
- It's so far.
- It's the world, dear.

615
01:05:31,162 --> 01:05:32,979
Did you expect it to be small?

616
01:05:33,605 --> 01:05:35,784
Smaller.

617
01:05:53,198 --> 01:05:55,849
When you're ready, Son of Adam.

618
01:06:31,038 --> 01:06:34,518
Come on, humans!
While we're still young.

619
01:06:35,754 --> 01:06:38,664
If he tells us to hurry one more time,

620
01:06:38,818 --> 01:06:42,000
I'm gonna turn him
into a big, fluffy hat.

621
01:06:42,549 --> 01:06:44,452
Hurry up! Come on!

622
01:06:44,689 --> 01:06:48,376
- He is getting a little bossy.
- Behind you! It's her!

623
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,962
- Run! Run!
- Run!

624
01:07:15,668 --> 01:07:17,076
Hurry!

625
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:21,756
Inside!

626
01:07:21,923 --> 01:07:23,727
Dive! Dive!

627
01:07:26,581 --> 01:07:27,850
Quick! Quick, quick, quick!

628
01:07:56,638 --> 01:07:59,956
Maybe she's gone.

629
01:08:00,005 --> 01:08:02,253
- I suppose I'll go look.
- No!

630
01:08:02,281 --> 01:08:04,878
You're worth nothing to Narnia dead.

631
01:08:05,474 --> 01:08:07,091
Well, neither are you, Beaver.

632
01:08:07,326 --> 01:08:09,374
Thanks, sweetheart.

633
01:08:24,669 --> 01:08:25,998
Come out! Come out!

634
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:29,285
I hope you've all been good
'cause there's someone here to see you!

635
01:08:51,164 --> 01:08:52,883
Merry Christmas, sir.

636
01:08:53,432 --> 01:08:57,503
It certainly is, Lucy,
since you have arrived.

637
01:08:57,628 --> 01:09:01,501
Look, I've put up with a lot
since I got here, but this...

638
01:09:01,672 --> 01:09:05,161
- We thought you were the Witch.
- Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that,

639
01:09:05,362 --> 01:09:10,884
but in my defense, I have been driving
one of these longer than the Witch.

640
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:13,689
I thought there was
no Christmas in Narnia.

641
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:16,729
No. For a long time.

642
01:09:17,288 --> 01:09:20,367
But the hope that you have brought,
Your Majesties,

643
01:09:20,966 --> 01:09:24,067
is finally starting
to weaken the Witch's power.

644
01:09:25,191 --> 01:09:28,661
Still, I dare say
you could do with these.

645
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:34,255
Presents!

646
01:09:40,197 --> 01:09:42,361
The juice of the fire-flower.

647
01:09:42,721 --> 01:09:46,678
One drop will cure any injury.

648
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:50,808
And though I hope
you never have to use it...

649
01:09:54,006 --> 01:09:55,692
Thank you, sir,

650
01:09:56,514 --> 01:09:59,209
but I think I could be brave enough.

651
01:09:59,401 --> 01:10:01,514
I'm sure you could.

652
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:05,273
But battles are ugly affairs.

653
01:10:12,214 --> 01:10:13,552
Susan.

654
01:10:16,934 --> 01:10:21,110
Trust in this bow
and it will not easily miss.

655
01:10:22,537 --> 01:10:25,901
What happened
to "battles are ugly affairs"?

656
01:10:27,207 --> 01:10:30,415
Though you don't seem to have
a problem making yourself heard,

657
01:10:30,566 --> 01:10:33,941
blow on this
and wherever you are,

658
01:10:35,046 --> 01:10:37,745
help will come.

659
01:10:37,955 --> 01:10:39,384
Thanks.

660
01:10:40,187 --> 01:10:41,978
Peter.

661
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:46,950
The time to use these
may be near at hand.

662
01:10:54,787 --> 01:10:57,171
Thank you, sir.

663
01:10:57,310 --> 01:11:00,556
These are tools, not toys.

664
01:11:00,929 --> 01:11:03,585
Bear them well and wisely.

665
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,770
Now, I must be off.

666
01:11:07,966 --> 01:11:10,068
Winter is almost over,

667
01:11:10,377 --> 01:11:14,970
and things do pile up
when you've been gone a hundred years.

668
01:11:17,978 --> 01:11:20,606
Long live Aslan!

669
01:11:22,525 --> 01:11:25,011
And Merry Christmas!

670
01:11:27,093 --> 01:11:29,613
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

671
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:35,292
Told you he was real.

672
01:11:35,799 --> 01:11:40,300
He said winter was almost over.

673
01:11:40,837 --> 01:11:42,230
You know what that means.

674
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:46,381
No more ice.

675
01:11:56,537 --> 01:11:59,786
- We need to cross, now!
- Don't beavers make dams?

676
01:12:00,003 --> 01:12:02,302
- I'm not that fast, dear.
- Come on!

677
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,501
Wait! Will you think
about this for a minute?

678
01:12:04,693 --> 01:12:07,582
- We don't have a minute.
- I'm just trying to be realistic.

679
01:12:07,772 --> 01:12:11,432
No, you're trying to be smart.
As usual.

680
01:12:45,835 --> 01:12:48,290
Wait. Maybe I should go first.

681
01:12:48,607 --> 01:12:50,427
Maybe you should.

682
01:12:57,210 --> 01:13:00,075
You've been sneaking
second helpings, haven't you?

683
01:13:00,273 --> 01:13:02,681
Well, you never know
which meal's gonna be your last.

684
01:13:02,826 --> 01:13:04,593
Especially with your cooking.

685
01:13:24,634 --> 01:13:26,093
If Mum knew what we were doing...

686
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:27,872
Mum's not here.

687
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:31,151
Oh, no!

688
01:13:31,971 --> 01:13:33,001
Run!

689
01:13:36,811 --> 01:13:38,148
Hurry!

690
01:13:49,515 --> 01:13:50,904
- No!
- Peter!

691
01:13:52,025 --> 01:13:53,910
Put that down, boy.

692
01:13:54,586 --> 01:13:57,799
- Someone could get hurt.
- Don't worry about me!

693
01:13:57,885 --> 01:13:59,242
Run him through!

694
01:13:59,278 --> 01:14:03,518
Leave now while you can,
and your brother leaves with you.

695
01:14:03,732 --> 01:14:05,903
Stop, Peter!
Maybe we should listen to him!

696
01:14:06,983 --> 01:14:07,917
Smart girl.

697
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:11,399
Don't listen to him!
Kill him! Kill him now!

698
01:14:11,629 --> 01:14:14,704
Oh, come on. This isn't your war.

699
01:14:14,896 --> 01:14:18,333
All my Queen wants is for you
to take your family and go.

700
01:14:18,511 --> 01:14:21,079
Look, just because some man
in a red coat hands you a sword,

701
01:14:21,242 --> 01:14:24,677
it doesn't make you a hero!
Just drop it!

702
01:14:24,888 --> 01:14:27,361
No, Peter!
Narnia needs you!

703
01:14:27,578 --> 01:14:29,581
Gut him while you still have a chance!

704
01:14:29,763 --> 01:14:34,075
What's it gonna be, Son of Adam?
I won't wait forever.

705
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:35,653
And neither will the river.

706
01:14:37,281 --> 01:14:38,652
Peter!

707
01:14:46,207 --> 01:14:47,690
Hold onto me!

708
01:15:49,361 --> 01:15:49,973
Lovely.

709
01:15:58,763 --> 01:15:59,923
What have you done?

710
01:16:02,981 --> 01:16:04,232
Lucy!

711
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:08,205
Lucy!

712
01:16:13,134 --> 01:16:14,989
Has anyone seen my coat?

713
01:16:21,385 --> 01:16:23,135
Don't you worry, dear.

714
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:26,484
Your brother's got you
well looked after.

715
01:16:27,186 --> 01:16:31,324
And I don't think you'll be
needing those coats anymore.

716
01:17:05,894 --> 01:17:08,592
It's so warm out.

717
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,596
I'll go and check the sleigh.

718
01:17:16,650 --> 01:17:18,184
Your Majesty.

719
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:20,445
We found the traitor.

720
01:17:20,628 --> 01:17:23,140
He was rallying your enemies
near the Shuddering Woods.

721
01:17:23,812 --> 01:17:26,261
Ah. Nice of you to drop in.

722
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,876
You were so helpful
to my wolves last night.

723
01:17:29,034 --> 01:17:31,525
Perhaps you can help me now.

724
01:17:31,906 --> 01:17:35,610
- Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- Oh, don't waste time with flattery.

725
01:17:35,844 --> 01:17:39,609
Not to seem rude,
but I wasn't actually talking to you.

726
01:17:48,172 --> 01:17:51,076
Where are the humans headed?

727
01:17:54,994 --> 01:17:59,763
Wait! No! Don't. The beaver said
something about the Stone Table,

728
01:17:59,942 --> 01:18:02,066
and that Aslan had an army there.

729
01:18:03,299 --> 01:18:04,930
An army?

730
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:12,178
Thank you, Edmund.

731
01:18:12,715 --> 01:18:16,327
I'm glad this creature
got to see some honesty...

732
01:18:17,982 --> 01:18:21,117
...before he dies.
- No!

733
01:18:31,158 --> 01:18:33,932
Think about whose side you're on,
Edmund.

734
01:18:34,455 --> 01:18:35,671
Mine...

735
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,380
...or theirs.

736
01:18:46,242 --> 01:18:49,094
Go on ahead.
Gather the faithful.

737
01:18:49,999 --> 01:18:52,439
If it's a war Aslan wants...

738
01:18:54,657 --> 01:18:57,110
...it's a war he shall get.

739
01:19:58,286 --> 01:20:00,033
Why are they all staring at us?

740
01:20:00,746 --> 01:20:03,631
Maybe they think you look funny.

741
01:20:08,374 --> 01:20:11,617
Oi, stop your fussing.
You look lovely.

742
01:20:30,112 --> 01:20:32,578
We have come to see Aslan.

743
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:19,526
Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam.

744
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:23,575
Welcome, Susan and Lucy,
Daughters of Eve.

745
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:27,030
And welcome to you, Beavers.
You have my thanks.

746
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:29,756
But where is the fourth?

747
01:21:30,914 --> 01:21:32,492
That's why we're here, sir.

748
01:21:33,986 --> 01:21:35,307
We need your help.

749
01:21:35,818 --> 01:21:37,984
We had a little trouble along the way.

750
01:21:39,306 --> 01:21:40,982
Our brother's been captured
by the White Witch.

751
01:21:41,113 --> 01:21:43,963
Captured? How could this happen?

752
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:50,076
He betrayed them, Your Majesty.

753
01:21:50,206 --> 01:21:53,310
- Then he has betrayed us all!
- Peace, Oreius.

754
01:21:54,127 --> 01:21:55,970
I'm sure there's an explanation.

755
01:21:58,908 --> 01:22:00,387
It's my fault, really.

756
01:22:02,329 --> 01:22:04,334
I was too hard on him.

757
01:22:08,483 --> 01:22:10,663
We all were.

758
01:22:10,964 --> 01:22:12,765
Sir, he's our brother.

759
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:14,842
I know, dear one.

760
01:22:15,132 --> 01:22:17,754
But that only makes
the betrayal all the worse.

761
01:22:18,636 --> 01:22:20,883
This may be harder than you think.

762
01:22:28,659 --> 01:22:33,430
That is Cair Paravel,
the castle of the four thrones.

763
01:22:34,414 --> 01:22:38,121
In one of which you will sit, Peter,
as High King.

764
01:22:39,596 --> 01:22:41,788
You doubt the prophecy?

765
01:22:41,845 --> 01:22:45,379
No. That's just it.

766
01:22:46,641 --> 01:22:49,446
Aslan, I'm not what you all think I am.

767
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:52,374
Peter Pevensie, formerly of Finchley.

768
01:22:53,929 --> 01:22:58,241
Beaver also mentioned that you
planned on turning him into a hat.

769
01:23:00,929 --> 01:23:04,560
Peter, there is a Deep Magic,

770
01:23:04,705 --> 01:23:08,402
more powerful than any of us,
that rules over all of Narnia.

771
01:23:08,874 --> 01:23:10,771
It defines right from wrong,

772
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,768
and governs all our destinies.

773
01:23:13,937 --> 01:23:17,615
Yours... and mine.

774
01:23:17,948 --> 01:23:19,432
But I couldn't even
protect my own family.

775
01:23:19,633 --> 01:23:21,405
You've brought them safely this far.

776
01:23:22,977 --> 01:23:24,617
Not all of them.

777
01:23:24,884 --> 01:23:28,523
Peter, I will do what I can
to help your brother,

778
01:23:28,941 --> 01:23:32,198
but I need you to consider
what I ask of you.

779
01:23:34,044 --> 01:23:36,823
I, too, want my family safe.

780
01:23:39,667 --> 01:23:43,569
Is our little prince uncomfortable?

781
01:23:43,782 --> 01:23:46,789
Does he want his pillow fluffed?

782
01:23:49,435 --> 01:23:53,117
Special treatment for the special boy!

783
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:57,688
Isn't that what you wanted?

784
01:23:59,744 --> 01:24:01,186
You look like Mum.

785
01:24:01,713 --> 01:24:04,828
Mum hasn't had a dress like this
since before the war.

786
01:24:05,879 --> 01:24:09,991
We should bring her one back.
A whole trunk full!

787
01:24:11,327 --> 01:24:13,886
If we ever get back.

788
01:24:17,422 --> 01:24:19,258
I'm sorry I'm like that.

789
01:24:21,355 --> 01:24:24,640
We used to have fun together, didn't we?

790
01:24:24,843 --> 01:24:28,297
Yes. Before you got boring.

791
01:24:29,046 --> 01:24:30,461
Oh, really?

792
01:24:43,806 --> 01:24:45,440
Please don't try to run.

793
01:24:45,489 --> 01:24:49,174
- We're tired.
- And we prefer to kill you quickly.

794
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:55,202
Susan!

795
01:25:05,212 --> 01:25:06,599
Get back!

796
01:25:07,655 --> 01:25:08,767
Peter! Ah!

797
01:25:11,187 --> 01:25:12,206
Come on.

798
01:25:13,539 --> 01:25:16,148
We've already been through this before.

799
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:19,173
We both know you haven't got it in you.

800
01:25:19,275 --> 01:25:21,369
Peter! Watch out!

801
01:25:30,388 --> 01:25:34,694
No! Stay your weapons.
This is Peter's battle.

802
01:25:36,154 --> 01:25:38,442
You may think you're a king,

803
01:25:38,623 --> 01:25:40,578
but you're going to die...

804
01:25:40,684 --> 01:25:42,594
...like a dog!
- Look out!

805
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:44,611
Peter!

806
01:26:02,571 --> 01:26:03,620
After him.

807
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:07,176
He'll lead you to Edmund.

808
01:26:12,168 --> 01:26:13,018
Peter.

809
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,521
Clean your sword.

810
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:24,413
Rise, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane,

811
01:26:24,929 --> 01:26:27,680
Knight of Narnia.

812
01:26:53,816 --> 01:26:55,594
The minotaurs will take the left flanks.

813
01:26:55,931 --> 01:26:58,526
We'll keep the giants in reserve
and send the dwarfs in first.

814
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:09,255
The prisoner!

815
01:27:38,441 --> 01:27:40,246
You're not
going to kill me?

816
01:27:43,901 --> 01:27:45,111
Not yet.

817
01:27:48,781 --> 01:27:50,974
We have work to do.

818
01:28:22,445 --> 01:28:23,663
Edmund!

819
01:28:56,127 --> 01:28:57,802
What's done is done.

820
01:28:58,441 --> 01:29:02,126
There is no need to speak to Edmund
about what is past.

821
01:29:11,464 --> 01:29:12,909
Hello.

822
01:29:27,068 --> 01:29:29,542
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little tired.

823
01:29:30,515 --> 01:29:32,265
Get some sleep.

824
01:29:40,429 --> 01:29:42,016
And Edmund...

825
01:29:44,669 --> 01:29:47,792
...try not to wander off.

826
01:29:59,714 --> 01:30:02,359
Narnia's not going
to run out of toast, Ed.

827
01:30:04,021 --> 01:30:06,507
I'm sure they'll pack something up
for the journey back.

828
01:30:07,146 --> 01:30:08,455
We're going home?

829
01:30:09,458 --> 01:30:10,899
You are.

830
01:30:12,717 --> 01:30:14,976
I promised Mum I'd keep you three safe.

831
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:18,384
But it doesn't mean
I can't stay behind and help.

832
01:30:18,808 --> 01:30:19,951
But they need us.

833
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:24,518
All four of us.

834
01:30:24,696 --> 01:30:26,020
Lucy, it's too dangerous.

835
01:30:26,334 --> 01:30:28,642
You almost drowned!
Edmund was almost killed!

836
01:30:29,778 --> 01:30:31,693
Which is why we have to stay.

837
01:30:34,555 --> 01:30:38,964
I've seen what the White Witch can do.
And I've helped her do it.

838
01:30:40,508 --> 01:30:43,276
And we can't leave these
people behind to suffer for it.

839
01:30:51,344 --> 01:30:53,264
I suppose that's it then.

840
01:30:55,086 --> 01:30:56,626
Where are you going?

841
01:30:58,666 --> 01:31:01,241
To get in some practice.

842
01:31:24,295 --> 01:31:27,348
Come on, Ed! Sword point up,
like Oreius showed us.

843
01:31:27,554 --> 01:31:29,115
- En garde!
- Now block.

844
01:31:30,799 --> 01:31:33,733
- Hey!
- Peter! Edmund!

845
01:31:35,184 --> 01:31:36,740
Whoa, horsie!

846
01:31:37,102 --> 01:31:39,675
- My name is Philip.
- Oh.

847
01:31:40,064 --> 01:31:41,521
Sorry.

848
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:44,283
The Witch has demanded
a meeting with Aslan.

849
01:31:45,635 --> 01:31:47,063
She's on her way here.

850
01:31:48,056 --> 01:31:52,090
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

851
01:31:52,884 --> 01:31:56,070
Empress of the Lone Islands!

852
01:32:23,518 --> 01:32:26,536
You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.

853
01:32:29,246 --> 01:32:32,541
His offense was not against you.

854
01:32:32,889 --> 01:32:36,276
Have you forgotten the laws
upon which Narnia was built?

855
01:32:36,508 --> 01:32:39,158
Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch.

856
01:32:39,648 --> 01:32:42,210
I was there when it was written.

857
01:32:43,649 --> 01:32:48,254
Then you'll remember well
that every traitor belongs to me.

858
01:32:49,663 --> 01:32:51,434
His blood is my property.

859
01:32:52,259 --> 01:32:54,225
Try and take him then.

860
01:32:57,466 --> 01:33:01,278
Do you really think that mere force
will deny me my right...

861
01:33:02,927 --> 01:33:04,989
...little King?

862
01:33:07,046 --> 01:33:10,547
Aslan knows that unless I have blood,
as the law demands,

863
01:33:11,381 --> 01:33:14,582
all of Narnia will be overturned

864
01:33:14,907 --> 01:33:17,707
and perish in fire and water.

865
01:33:17,886 --> 01:33:20,649
That boy will die

866
01:33:20,842 --> 01:33:22,368
on the Stone Table...

867
01:33:26,221 --> 01:33:28,699
...as is tradition.

868
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:33,233
You dare not refuse me.

869
01:33:33,930 --> 01:33:35,451
Enough.

870
01:33:38,247 --> 01:33:40,988
I shall talk with you alone.

871
01:34:33,689 --> 01:34:36,911
She has renounced her claim
on the Son of Adam's blood.

872
01:34:39,003 --> 01:34:41,403
How do I know your promise will be kept?

873
01:35:34,856 --> 01:35:38,147
- Susan!
- Mm?

874
01:36:27,052 --> 01:36:29,740
Shouldn't you both be in bed?

875
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,322
We couldn't sleep.

876
01:36:35,938 --> 01:36:37,279
Please, Aslan.

877
01:36:38,764 --> 01:36:40,705
Couldn't we come with you?

878
01:36:41,084 --> 01:36:43,611
I would be glad of the company
for a while.

879
01:36:45,289 --> 01:36:46,952
Thank you.

880
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:12,359
It is time.

881
01:37:13,074 --> 01:37:16,792
From here, I must go on alone.

882
01:37:17,008 --> 01:37:17,502
But Aslan...

883
01:37:17,703 --> 01:37:22,155
You have to trust me.
For this must be done.

884
01:37:22,394 --> 01:37:23,414
Thank you, Susan.

885
01:37:24,117 --> 01:37:26,068
Thank you, Lucy.

886
01:37:26,594 --> 01:37:28,352
And farewell.

887
01:38:33,783 --> 01:38:38,105
Behold. The great lion.

888
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:05,314
Do you want some milk?

889
01:39:06,687 --> 01:39:08,617
Why doesn't he fight back?

890
01:39:10,101 --> 01:39:11,409
Bind him!

891
01:39:21,488 --> 01:39:22,629
Wait!

892
01:39:23,432 --> 01:39:26,585
Let him first be shaved.

893
01:39:48,173 --> 01:39:50,570
Bring him to me.

894
01:40:51,258 --> 01:40:52,553
You know, Aslan,

895
01:40:53,926 --> 01:40:55,999
I'm a little disappointed in you.

896
01:40:58,094 --> 01:41:02,138
Did you honestly think by all this
that you could save the human traitor?

897
01:41:05,328 --> 01:41:07,920
You are giving me your life

898
01:41:08,046 --> 01:41:10,537
and saving no one.

899
01:41:12,864 --> 01:41:14,957
So much for love.

900
01:41:23,739 --> 01:41:24,925
Tonight...

901
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:31,981
...the Deep Magic will be appeased!

902
01:41:34,844 --> 01:41:36,663
But tomorrow,

903
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:42,584
we will take Narnia

904
01:41:42,828 --> 01:41:48,035
forever!

905
01:41:51,986 --> 01:41:53,519
In that knowledge,

906
01:41:54,766 --> 01:41:56,069
despair...

907
01:42:06,604 --> 01:42:10,186
...and die!

908
01:42:27,461 --> 01:42:29,363
The Great Cat...

909
01:42:29,845 --> 01:42:32,582
...is dead!

910
01:42:35,725 --> 01:42:36,987
General.

911
01:42:37,943 --> 01:42:40,125
Prepare your troops for battle.

912
01:42:43,848 --> 01:42:45,935
However short it may be.

913
01:43:34,627 --> 01:43:36,244
It's too late.

914
01:43:37,992 --> 01:43:39,808
He's gone.

915
01:43:58,793 --> 01:44:01,609
He must have known what he was doing.

916
01:44:35,115 --> 01:44:38,475
Get away! Get away, all of you!

917
01:44:39,244 --> 01:44:42,247
No. Look.

918
01:45:02,679 --> 01:45:04,496
We have to tell the others.

919
01:45:05,355 --> 01:45:09,009
- We can't just leave him!
- Lucy, there's no time.

920
01:45:09,256 --> 01:45:10,860
They need to know.

921
01:45:17,878 --> 01:45:19,924
The trees.

922
01:46:04,111 --> 01:46:05,946
Be still, my Princes.

923
01:46:07,999 --> 01:46:11,275
I bring grave news from your sisters.

924
01:46:26,198 --> 01:46:27,690
She's right.

925
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:33,246
He's gone.

926
01:46:38,881 --> 01:46:40,936
Then you'll have to lead us.

927
01:46:43,078 --> 01:46:48,329
Peter, there's an army out there
and it's ready to follow you.

928
01:46:48,388 --> 01:46:51,340
- I can't.
- Aslan believed you could.

929
01:46:54,923 --> 01:46:56,930
And so do I.

930
01:47:04,103 --> 01:47:08,208
The Witch's army is nearing, sire.
What are your orders?

931
01:47:53,778 --> 01:47:57,727
They come, Your Highness, in numbers
and weapons far greater than our own.

932
01:47:57,950 --> 01:47:59,853
Numbers do not win a battle.

933
01:48:00,057 --> 01:48:03,614
No. But I bet they help.

934
01:49:33,677 --> 01:49:35,796
I have no interest in prisoners.

935
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:38,061
Kill them all.

936
01:50:35,324 --> 01:50:38,151
Look to the sky!

937
01:51:04,947 --> 01:51:06,394
Are you with me?

938
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:09,726
To the death.

939
01:51:12,912 --> 01:51:18,194
For Narnia and for Aslan!

940
01:51:21,342 --> 01:51:22,114
Go!

941
01:51:23,662 --> 01:51:27,208
Go! For Aslan!

942
01:52:58,849 --> 01:53:00,404
We should go.

943
01:53:06,033 --> 01:53:08,026
I'm so cold.

944
01:53:34,102 --> 01:53:35,648
Susan!

945
01:53:52,328 --> 01:53:53,521
Where's Aslan?

946
01:53:55,557 --> 01:53:57,240
What have they done?

947
01:54:07,402 --> 01:54:09,639
Aslan!

948
01:54:17,451 --> 01:54:20,137
But we saw the knife. The Witch.

949
01:54:20,338 --> 01:54:23,127
If the Witch knew
the true meaning of sacrifice,

950
01:54:23,598 --> 01:54:26,617
she might have interpreted
the Deep Magic differently.

951
01:54:26,809 --> 01:54:29,837
That when a willing victim
who has committed no treachery

952
01:54:30,025 --> 01:54:32,008
is killed in a traitor's stead,

953
01:54:32,664 --> 01:54:34,431
the Stone Table will crack

954
01:54:35,212 --> 01:54:38,894
and even death itself
will turn backwards.

955
01:54:38,919 --> 01:54:41,261
We sent the news that you were dead.

956
01:54:41,768 --> 01:54:43,902
Peter and Edmund will have gone to war.

957
01:54:44,050 --> 01:54:45,123
We have to help them.

958
01:54:45,635 --> 01:54:49,177
We will, dear one, but not alone.

959
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,438
Climb on my back.

960
01:54:51,664 --> 01:54:54,756
We have far to go
and little time to get there.

961
01:54:54,945 --> 01:54:57,102
And you may want to cover your ears.

962
01:55:17,495 --> 01:55:19,375
Fire!

963
01:55:39,208 --> 01:55:41,269
Yes!

964
01:55:53,476 --> 01:55:56,891
Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!

965
01:55:57,868 --> 01:56:00,522
That's the signal. Come on!

966
01:56:08,092 --> 01:56:09,508
Where are we going?

967
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,608
Hang on!

968
01:56:22,844 --> 01:56:24,007
Fall back!

969
01:57:03,905 --> 01:57:05,908
Stop!

970
01:59:17,930 --> 01:59:19,848
Susan, this is...

971
01:59:20,025 --> 01:59:21,562
Mr. Tumnus!

972
01:59:22,912 --> 01:59:26,240
Come, we must hurry
and search the castle.

973
01:59:26,452 --> 01:59:29,401
Peter will need everyone we can find.

974
01:59:55,889 --> 01:59:58,374
Edmund! There's too many!

975
01:59:58,478 --> 02:00:00,144
Get out of here!

976
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:03,096
Get the girls and get them home!

977
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:07,880
You heard him! Let's go!

978
02:00:27,766 --> 02:00:29,190
Peter said get out of here!

979
02:00:29,343 --> 02:00:30,942
Peter's not king yet.

980
02:02:08,139 --> 02:02:09,802
Impossible!

981
02:03:24,306 --> 02:03:26,243
It is finished.

982
02:03:27,414 --> 02:03:28,822
- Peter!
- Peter!

983
02:03:34,938 --> 02:03:36,763
Where's Edmund?

984
02:03:48,370 --> 02:03:50,487
Edmund!

985
02:04:43,152 --> 02:04:45,858
When are you gonna learn
to do as you're told?

986
02:06:21,261 --> 02:06:23,846
To the glistening Eastern Sea,

987
02:06:24,115 --> 02:06:28,151
I give you Queen Lucy the Valiant.

988
02:06:53,291 --> 02:06:55,466
To the great Western Wood,

989
02:06:55,770 --> 02:06:59,967
King Edmund the Just.

990
02:07:01,294 --> 02:07:03,814
To the radiant Southern Sun,

991
02:07:05,308 --> 02:07:09,318
Queen Susan, the Gentle.

992
02:07:10,089 --> 02:07:13,377
And to the clear Northern Sky,

993
02:07:13,922 --> 02:07:16,055
I give you King Peter,

994
02:07:17,114 --> 02:07:19,202
the Magnificent.

995
02:07:23,259 --> 02:07:25,597
Once a King or Queen of Narnia,

996
02:07:25,844 --> 02:07:28,734
always a King or Queen.

997
02:07:29,315 --> 02:07:31,169
May your wisdom grace us

998
02:07:31,290 --> 02:07:34,095
until the stars rain down
from the heavens.

999
02:07:34,825 --> 02:07:36,563
Long live King Peter!

1000
02:07:37,285 --> 02:07:39,037
Long live King Edmund!

1001
02:07:40,043 --> 02:07:41,936
Long live Queen Susan!

1002
02:07:42,417 --> 02:07:45,156
Long live Queen Lucy!

1003
02:08:09,746 --> 02:08:10,732
Don't worry.

1004
02:08:13,670 --> 02:08:15,424
We'll see him again.

1005
02:08:15,601 --> 02:08:17,850
- When?
- In time.

1006
02:08:19,284 --> 02:08:23,914
One day he'll be here
and the next he won't.

1007
02:08:25,528 --> 02:08:27,333
But you mustn't press him.

1008
02:08:28,608 --> 02:08:31,854
After all, he's not a tame lion.

1009
02:08:32,057 --> 02:08:33,498
No.

1010
02:08:34,174 --> 02:08:36,331
But he is good.

1011
02:08:37,795 --> 02:08:38,863
Here.

1012
02:08:39,952 --> 02:08:43,170
You need it more than I do.

1013
02:09:38,293 --> 02:09:39,508
Are you all right, Philip?

1014
02:09:40,699 --> 02:09:42,749
I'm not as young as I once was.

1015
02:09:45,301 --> 02:09:46,397
Come on, Ed.

1016
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:50,878
- Just catching my breath.
- That's all we'll catch at this rate.

1017
02:09:51,036 --> 02:09:53,365
- What did he say, Susan?
- "Wait in the castle.

1018
02:09:53,542 --> 02:09:55,308
I'll get the stag myself."

1019
02:10:00,834 --> 02:10:02,787
What's this?

1020
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:10,040
It seems familiar.

1021
02:10:12,826 --> 02:10:15,040
As if from a dream.

1022
02:10:15,116 --> 02:10:16,724
Or a dream of a dream.

1023
02:10:20,517 --> 02:10:22,677
Spare Oom.

1024
02:10:25,388 --> 02:10:27,383
- Lucy!
- Not again.

1025
02:10:29,627 --> 02:10:31,433
- Lu?
- Come on!

1026
02:10:43,181 --> 02:10:44,450
These aren't branches.

1027
02:10:47,092 --> 02:10:50,305
- They're coats.
- Susan, you're on my foot!

1028
02:10:50,504 --> 02:10:52,100
Peter, move off!

1029
02:10:52,535 --> 02:10:54,661
- Stop shoving.
- Stop it!

1030
02:10:54,859 --> 02:10:56,484
I'm not on your toe!

1031
02:11:14,549 --> 02:11:16,423
There you are.

1032
02:11:19,071 --> 02:11:21,466
What were you all
doing in the wardrobe?

1033
02:11:22,952 --> 02:11:26,132
You wouldn't believe us
if we told you, sir.

1034
02:11:31,988 --> 02:11:33,935
Try me.

1035
02:12:36,772 --> 02:12:38,980
I don't think
you'll get back in that way.

1036
02:12:42,092 --> 02:12:46,093
You see... I've already tried.

1037
02:12:49,017 --> 02:12:50,570
Will we ever go back?

1038
02:12:51,318 --> 02:12:52,551
Oh, I expect so.

1039
02:12:54,055 --> 02:12:56,853
But it'll probably happen
when you're not looking for it.

1040
02:12:59,324 --> 02:13:01,071
All the same...

1041
02:13:01,113 --> 02:13:02,862
best to keep your eyes open.
