<i>The specimens are secured,

You are a go for reentry.</i>

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,030
I don't want to have to wait
for full clean-up just to get

16
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,500
- a status report.
- We're collecting this data

17
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,500
- as quickly as possible.
- That's not good enough.

18
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,300
Okay, maybe you can tell me
what happened.

19
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,100
There was some kind of breach.
One of the astronauts

20
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,460
- sent a distress call.
- What about the crew?

21
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,100
- We're still investigating.
- Where did it go down?

22
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,100
It's 20 kilometers
west of Sibu.

23
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,300
Did we at least retrieve
all of the samples?

24
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,100
No. We have
three of them.

25
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,060
One of the organisms
got out of containment,

26
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,130
and it's missing.
We don't know which one.

27
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,160
What is she saying?

28
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,300
One of the astronauts
is still alive.

29
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,300
That's Jameson.

30
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,500
- Morning, sunshine.
- What?

31
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,940
I'm awake.

32
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,370
Missed me.

33
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,070
- I'm awake.
- Here you go.

34
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,300
- You can have it back.
- Thank...

35
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,330
Oh, wow,
you're wearing a suit. Yes!

36
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,830
- I love it when you wear the suit.
- Thank you.

37
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,130
I have depositions today
in the Life Foundation case.

38
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,400
Hey, let me know
how your meeting goes.

39
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,040
My meeting?

40
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,900
Oh, shit. Yeah.

41
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,800
My meeting.

42
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,300
- Coffee.
- Oh. Mmm!

43
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,200
- You are perfect.
- Thank you.

44
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,100
Hey, you know what...
You know what night

45
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,930
- it is tonight, right?
- Date night.

46
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,870
Mmm-hmm. So, I will pick
you up around, uh, 6:00.

47
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,300
And please do not forget
your helmet.

48
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,870
Oh, I'm glad
that you like it,

49
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,370
'cause I plan on wearing it
at our wedding.

50
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,100
That's hot.

51
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,000
Feed the cat.

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,300
I will.

53
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,840
I love you!

54
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,440
Love you, too.
Feed the cat.

Hey, Richard!

73
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,540
- Lookin' good!
- Eddie, you can't park there, bro.

74
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,870
Come on, man. There's
no such thing as can't.

75
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,140
How'd she do?

76
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,070
Berkeley. Brown. MIT.

77
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,070
- She's got a scholarship, bro.
- What'd I tell you?

78
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,540
You told me what?

79
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,510
- No such thing as can't.
- Eddie.

80
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,070
The bike.

81
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,470
MIT! Whoo!

82
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,940
You know what I love
about this view?

83
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,540
- It never gets old.
- Yeah, well, uh...

84
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,440
Height's not really my thing.

85
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,010
But, uh...
What's the deal?

86
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,370
- I got you the big one, exclusive.
- Yeah? Who?

87
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,010
Carlton Drake.

88
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,040
- Carlton Drake?
- The man's a visionary.

89
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,240
He wants to talk
about his rockets,

90
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,940
assure everyone they're safe,
that the crash was an anomaly.

91
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,310
Uh...

92
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,310
He's... He's seriously off.

93
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,010
I'm gonna level with you.

94
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,410
Carlton Drake could buy us
with his pocket cash,

95
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,840
turn this building into his
own garage if he so wished.

96
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,840
Now, you're just gonna ask him
about his space program,

97
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,240
you're gonna thank him, and
you're gonna bid him a nice day.

98
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,170
He's a crook.

99
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,370
Eddie, when you had nowhere
to go, we gave you a home.

100
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,540
Now, you know we love
the Eddie Brock show.

101
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,470
There isn't a better investigative
reporter working today,

102
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,240
but no one
is above the network.

103
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,310
So do me a favor, Eddie,
don't start your shit again.

104
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,010
All right, all right.

105
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,370
- For me.
- All right. I'll do it.

106
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,040
I don't know why he gave
me this assignment, Annie.

107
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,840
It's not...
It's not what I do.

108
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,370
Well, my mother
always told me

109
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,340
that anything in life worth
having would take sacrifice...

110
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,540
- Mmm-hmm.
- Patience...

111
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,970
- Mmm.
- And be a lot of work.

112
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,410
- Oh.
- That's you...

113
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,070
- That's not.
- ...that I'm talking about.

114
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,280
- Nah.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,480
Well, you're lucky
to have me.

116
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,480
To be fair,
I'm quite a catch.

117
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,940
That's what my mom told me.

118
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,970
Are you gonna
behave yourself tomorrow?

119
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,210
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

120
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,280
I can't, you know,
not do my job.

121
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,140
The guy you work for
is a complete...

122
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,210
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

123
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,840
and my firm works for him.

124
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,310
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

125
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,410
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

126
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,170
- A repeat?
- Of the <i>Daily Globe</i> incident.

127
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,910
Ow! Really?

128
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,510
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

129
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,010
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- I was not. I did not.

130
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,410
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

131
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,940
No, I still have
currency in New York.

132
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,240
I was going places.

133
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,340
I wasn't running.

134
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,110
I was going places.

135
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,940
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

136
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,810
- Me?
- You are my home.

137
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,540
You're not so bad yourself,
champ.

138
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,210
- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

139
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,480
Let's just get the check.

140
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,180
I'm gonna get a drink.

141
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,810
Shh.

142
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,380
Very soon,
another Life Foundation rocket

143
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,950
will be sent
on an exploratory mission.

144
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,210
And that's how, one day,
we might all live in space.

145
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,910
Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you

146
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,050
some of the cool stuff
that we do here,

147
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,310
I'm hoping I've inspired
each and every one of you

148
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,510
to go out there
and create things that others

149
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,910
- have only dreamt of.
- Mr. Drake?

150
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,980
- Shh!
- It's okay. Don't silence her.

151
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,910
Come here. What's your name?

152
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,950
- Allie.
- It's okay, Allie.

153
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,520
You know, sometimes
that's what people do.

154
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,210
They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.

155
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,280
But you know what?
In the end,

156
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,210
we're the ones
who change the world.

157
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,150
Take good care
of that, Allie.

158
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,910
Guys, this is Dr. Skirth.

159
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,280
- Say hi.
- Hi.

160
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,480
Hello, kids.

161
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,510
Um, sorry to interrupt,

162
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,880
but it's time to get changed
for your interview.

163
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,080
Yeah. Uh, kids,
sorry to leave you.

164
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,380
Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.

165
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,850
Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's
question, and any others.

166
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,520
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!

167
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,550
<i>What do you say,
Mr. Drake,</i>

168
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,510
we just start
at the beginning?

169
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,550
- Born to British parents.
- Mmm-hmm.

170
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,080
And then at 19, you
discovered a gene therapy

171
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,880
that literally doubles
the life expectancy

172
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,380
- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,

173
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,450
it tripled their
life expectancy.

174
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,120
But it's okay.

175
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,150
Okay, um, 24.
That's still extremely young.

176
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,150
All right, you create

177
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,850
- the Life Foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.

178
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,520
- And then...
- Rockets.

179
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

180
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,520
that you're gonna go
and explore space.

181
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,050
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

182
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,880
- Uh-huh.
- ...that space exploration

183
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,480
is crucial
in our quest to cure

184
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,420
everything that ails us
here on Earth.

185
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,980
But if you think about
everything we've found...

186
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,420
- Uh-huh.
- ...in the oceans and on land,

187
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,350
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

188
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,850
To this plethora
of untapped resources?

189
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,350
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

190
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,180
from your pharmaceutical
companies

191
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,980
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

192
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,180
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

193
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,520
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

194
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,820
So, I have to ask,
how does that work,

195
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,420
you know, exactly,
the Life Foundation thing?

196
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,420
How does it...
How does it, um...

197
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,350
I don't know,
how does it go about,

198
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,420
- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
- Eddie, we're talking

199
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,250
- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

200
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,250
I'm talking
about the allegations.

201
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,850
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that

202
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,350
your entire empire
has been built

203
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,420
- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.

204
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,850
It's true, right?
It says that you recruit

205
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,050
the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests...

206
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,380
- Hmm.
- ...that more often than not

207
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,950
end up killing people.

208
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,450
Yeah, I'm aware
of these rumors online.

209
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,820
There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.

210
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,250
Right. What about
the legal cases?

211
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,820
Sorry?

212
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,950
Uh, the actual legal cases,
like Sarah Chambers,

213
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,880
- Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.
- That's it. Time to go.

214
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,220
Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.

215
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,820
And they're just some
of the people who walked

216
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.

217
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,480
- Cut the camera off, please.
- Thank you very much.

218
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,180
- Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The Dead...

219
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,450
- Could you show him out, please?
- The Dead Found...

220
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,250
Don't touch me.
The Dead Foundation thing.

221
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,120
- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.

222
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,980
Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.

223
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,850
Is that a threat?

224
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,490
Have a nice life.

225
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,150
I know what
you're going to say, but...

226
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,820
This guy, he is
all the way bad, Jack.

227
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,850
- If you just give...
- Who's your source?

228
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,390
- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?

229
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,820
I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.

230
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,550
This isn't the Wild Wild West.

231
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,520
We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.

232
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,080
We do the work.

233
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,550
We substantiate
our accusations.

234
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,850
We provide evidence.

235
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,190
You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumb-ass.

236
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,120
You're fired, Eddie.

237
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
I can't trust you.

238
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,520
Have a nice life.

239
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,520
- Will just take a second.
- Okay.

240
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,390
Hey.

241
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,390
You are pathologically
self-absorbed.

242
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,920
Annie. Annie,
can you talk to me first?

243
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,950
Your ego requires
constant attention,

244
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,020
and you're stubborn as hell.

245
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,250
But I was willing to roll with
it, Eddie, because I loved you.

246
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,420
You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?

247
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,450
What you did
got me fired.

248
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,290
You used me.

249
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,320
Annie? Annie.

250
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,920
Oh, my God.

251
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,060
You're beautiful.

252
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,990
Test 36.

253
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,530
Biological interactions

254
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,860
between two different organisms.

255
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,460
These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host

256
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,490
in order to survive
for any amount of time

257
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,330
in an oxygen-rich environment.

258
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,530
Well, why are
all these hosts

259
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,290
showing this hyper-acute
rejection?

260
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,260
That's what
we're trying to find out.

261
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,500
The bonding process
is starting.

262
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,990
It's equalizing.

263
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,060
But why? Why this rabbit?

264
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,530
- It's similar to an organ transplant.
- Huh.

265
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,490
Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?

266
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,060
- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.

267
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,930
If we do achieve symbiosis, they
should be able to survive here,

268
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:40,230
but also we would
be able to survive there.

269
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,930
"We"?

270
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,060
- Begin human trials.
- Oh, it's way too soon

271
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,030
to even begin to think
about something like...

272
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,460
Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.

273
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,960
I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?

274
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,530
I understand,
but it's an ethical question.

275
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,490
Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.

276
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,360
Hey, how are your kids?

277
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,890
Let's begin human trials.

278
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,030
Good work.

279
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,460
Hey, Jack.

280
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,430
Do you ever feel
like your life

281
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,060
- is like one monumental screwup?
- Nope.

282
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,560
<i>Here at the Life Foundation,</i>

283
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,830
- <i>we've always believed...</i>
- Isn't that your buddy?

284
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,300
<i>...in finding the lessons
in our disappointments.</i>

285
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,990
<i>In the months
since our rocket failed,</i>

286
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,530
<i>we've learned so much.</i>

287
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,530
Do you think we could,
like, switch him off?

288
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,230
Some people
are trying to watch that.

289
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,530
Oh, you are, are you?

290
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,130
- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?

291
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,530
I used to be.

292
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,430
<i>We take
the same view of progress.</i>

293
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,060
<i>Thrilled to announce
that the Life Foundation</i>

294
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,030
<i>has now begun preparations
on its next launch.</i>

295
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,430
All right, Jack,
this is for you.

296
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,400
I do not want you
to spend it all at once.

297
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,430
I'm going to go home and chase
myself around the room,

298
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,430
playing hard to get.

299
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,900
- Hey, Maria.
- Eddie.

300
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,530
- How's it going?
- Righteous, Eddie.

301
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,530
Oh! Yeah, we're empty.

302
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,900
Cost you $5.

303
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,030
$5 for a paper that's free?

304
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,030
I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,

305
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,830
got the papers out and
brought 'em back over here,

306
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,300
so you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.

307
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,360
You did that for me?

308
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,970
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

309
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,030
- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.

310
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,460
Tell you what, you give
me a dollar for a song,

311
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,130
I'll throw in the paper.

312
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,860
I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,

313
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,330
but not to sing,
all right?

314
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,100
Deal.

315
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

316
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,830
No. You're welcome.

317
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,130
Hey, Mrs. Chen.

318
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,400
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, aches and pains,

319
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
you know, aches and pains.

320
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,570
You look like shit.

321
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,960
Excuse me?

322
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,330
You look like shit.

323
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,530
And you look
as beautiful as ever.

324
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,260
- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.

325
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,130
Have you been meditating
like I showed you?

326
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,130
- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,

327
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,260
- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,

328
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,470
because I bought a DVD off your
cousin, and it was in Mandarin.

329
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,270
Yeah, I don't understand that, either.

330
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,000
See, that right there, I don't
understand what you just said.

331
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,170
That is the problem.

332
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,030
Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.

333
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,430
Please.

334
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,900
Let's go.

335
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,400
Before the price goes up
for my protection.

336
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,430
The full payment is due.
Now.

337
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,530
Make sure you have
my money ready, Chen.

338
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,240
I don't like to wait.

339
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,500
Life hurts, Eddie.

340
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,500
It just does.

341
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,830
I gotta go.

342
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,900
- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.

343
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,540
What a dick.

344
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,870
I'm not even
asking to staff there.

345
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,400
Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.

346
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,870
I can use a pseudonym.

347
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,340
Any name. Think...
You pick a name.

348
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,340
I could be a woman.
Have you seen <i>Tootsie?</i>

349
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,240
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

350
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,100
Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.

351
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:37,540
<i>Realize deeply that the
present moment is all you ever have.</i>

352
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,370
<i>Make the now the primary
focus of your life.</i>

353
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,840
<i>Any action is often better
than no action,</i>

354
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,470
<i>especially if you
have been stuck</i>

355
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,200
<i>in an unhappy situation
for a long time.</i>

356
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,200
<i>If it is a mistake, at least
you learned something,</i>

357
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,840
<i>in which case
it's no longer...</i>

358
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,070
Thank you all for
bringing us to this moment.

359
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,510
Our names will be spoken
long after we are dust.

360
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,170
History starts now.

361
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,870
This is day one.

362
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,140
This is first contact.

363
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,510
Let's get to work.

364
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,470
<i>Establishing subject baseline.</i>

365
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,810
<i>All vital signs are normal.</i>

366
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,540
Put me through.

367
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,370
There's no need to be
frightened, Isaac.

368
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,170
There's no need.

369
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,210
Isaac. You know
that's a biblical name?

370
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,240
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

371
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,370
<i>God said to Abraham,
"Give me your son,</i>

372
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,110
<i>"show me you are willing
to sacrifice the one thing</i>

373
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,270
"most precious to you,"
and Abraham was willing.

374
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,340
You know what's always
impressed me about that story?

375
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,410
<i>It isn't Abraham's sacrifice.
It's Isaac's.</i>

376
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,940
<i>Now, I don't know what kind of
God would ask that of someone,</i>

377
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,270
<i>but it doesn't change
anything for me.</i>

378
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,070
Isaac is still the hero
of this story.

379
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,970
Look around you.
Look at the world.

380
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,440
<i>What do you see?
War, poverty,</i>

381
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,580
<i>a planet on the brink
of collapse.</i>

382
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,870
<i>I would argue that God
has abandoned us.</i>

383
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,510
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain, Isaac,

384
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,540
<i>so now it's down to you and me
to put this right.</i>

385
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,080
<i>And this time, Isaac,
we can.</i>

386
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,070
We will.

387
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,140
<i>This time,
I will not abandon us.</i>

388
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,540
<i>Yes.</i>

389
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
Open it.

390
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,510
What the hell is that?
What? No, what...

391
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,240
<i>Please let me... No.</i>

392
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,410
Oh, please, please, please!

393
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,540
His vitals are holding steady.

394
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,240
- Where the hell did it go?
- <i>Incredible.</i>

395
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,810
<i>Where did it go?</i>

396
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,980
<i>Where is it?</i>

397
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,250
Bring in the next volunteer.

398
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,980
You know,
I used to be a reporter.

399
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,380
I was...

400
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,110
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

401
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,280
My job, it required you to...
You know, to follow people

402
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,580
that did not want to be followed
and hide in plain sight.

403
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,380
I mean...

404
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,180
You have to know
how to disappear.

405
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,250
I was pretty good, but,
you know, you...

406
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,180
Whoever you are, you suck.

407
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,150
Okay.

408
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,210
- Uh, my name is Dora Skirth.
- Mmm.

409
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,550
I need your help.

410
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,250
- I work at the Life Foundation.
- You do?

411
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,980
- Yes.
- Wow. Good for you.

412
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,980
We're done.

413
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,580
No...

414
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,910
Mr. Brock, please...
Please listen to me.

415
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,980
Everything that you
accused him of,

416
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,310
you were right.
It's all true.

417
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,850
- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

418
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,910
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

419
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,250
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

420
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,080
and he's using them
like guinea pigs,

421
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,150
and they are dying.

422
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,250
They are all dying.

423
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,820
- You've seen that?
- Yes.

424
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,980
Come here.

425
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,210
Why would I believe you?

426
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,380
Because it's true.

427
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,150
I believed in him, and I...

428
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,080
I told myself
that it was worth it

429
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,250
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

430
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,580
- Something else.
- Go to the cops.

431
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,110
I can't do that.

432
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,910
I'm afraid of what
will happen to my family.

433
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,550
He's a very dangerous man, and
he's a very powerful man...

434
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,210
I know, I know
how dangerous he is,

435
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,880
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

436
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,080
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

437
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,450
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

438
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:37,210
I lost my apartment, I lost
everything I ever cared about.

439
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,520
You know why? Carlton Drake
ruined me. Finished.

440
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,050
Now, if you are
who you say you are,

441
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,350
genuinely,
and you have proof,

442
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,420
then you should be
very, very, very afraid.

443
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,450
I am.

444
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,450
You need to find yourself another
white knight, Ms. Skirth,

445
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,910
because I am done.

446
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,280
I am done
with all of this shit.

447
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,520
What shit?

448
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,480
All of this "saving my
fellow man" shit.

449
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,050
All right? Good night.

450
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,220
Eddie?

451
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,580
Well, hey. Whoa.

452
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,850
Anne, I was just walking by,
and, uh...

453
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,180
I saw Mr. Belvedere.

454
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,950
I felt concerned for
his welfare, so...

455
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,550
Eddie...

456
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,380
This is Dan.

457
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,420
- Dan, this is Eddie.
- Yeah.

458
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,150
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

459
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,580
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

460
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,880
- Really?
- Yeah.

461
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,880
I'm a big fan of your work.

462
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,220
- Thank you.
- Really?

463
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,420
It's pretty cool, all the
people that he took down.

464
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,850
Yeah, I was one of them.

465
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,380
Well, look,
I'll let you guys catch up.

466
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,020
- So I'll see you inside?
- You're the best.

467
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,890
- Really nice meeting you, man.
- Uh, you, too.

468
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,090
He has a key. You know he has a key?

469
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,450
Yeah. How else
would he get in?

470
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,920
Yeah. Well, uh...

471
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,320
So, uh, what you up to?

472
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,520
You realize that's light-years away
from being any of your business, right?

Hey, well, just asking,
you know.

474
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,120
So, is Dan, uh, a lawyer?

475
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,080
No, he's a doctor.

476
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,120
- Surgeon, actually.
- Oh.

477
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,120
How's Mr. Belvedere, anyway?

478
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,550
I would say
that he misses you,

479
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,320
but that would be bullshit,
'cause...

480
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,020
- He's a cat.
- No, because he never liked you.

481
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,420
No, he's a cat,
and cats don't like anyone.

482
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,550
You look good, by the way.

483
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,990

doing here, Eddie?

484
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,050
I'm here 'cause I miss you.

485
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,050
A lot.

486
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,450
You know, we were gonna
get married.

487
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,020
That wasn't so long ago,
and now, you know...

488
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,920
I can't really believe
that we're not...

489

No, we can't.

503
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,560
Yeah, got it, right.

504
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,590

away from an uninhabitable Earth.

505
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,420
- Uh, yeah.
- Drake is using his personal rockets

506
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,520
to scout real estate.

507
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,390
You know, it's a really
interesting story,

508
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,520
but we need to just get to the
part where he's killing people.

509
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,590
Drake sent a ship
on a recon mission.

510
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,420
On the way back,
they found a comet.

511
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,720
A comet?

512

Onboard computers indicated the presence
of life, of millions of organisms.

513

Wait, wait, wait, when you
say "millions of organisms,"

514
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,520
- what do you mean?
- We brought back some specimens.

515
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,960
You're talking about aliens?

516
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,590

Yes.

520
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,430
But we don't
call them that.

521
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,290
- We call them Symbiotes.
- Symbiotes?

522
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,960
And they cannot survive in
our environment without help.

523
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,420
Drake believes that the union
between human and Symbiote

524
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:32,290
is the key to our survival,
but not here on Earth.

525
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:36,760
Drake is trying to put human
beings and aliens together?

526
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,260
So they can live in space?

527

We call them hosts.

528
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,490
That's nuts, isn't it?
That's completely insane.

00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,580
Eddie, Jesus!

627
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,710
This is dead.

628
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,670
Dead.

629
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,310
Eddie, sit down.

630
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,270
Okay, all right. Okay.

631
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,840
- Hey, hey, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
- Stop that.

632
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,470
- Sir, sir, sir, I'm so sorry.
- Eddie, quit it.

633
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,610
Put it down. Eddie!

634
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,640
Snap out of it!

635
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,670
No.

636
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,440
All right. It's no good.

637
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,870
Bobby,
are you all right?

638
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,010
- Hey!
- Whoa!

639
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,910
Hey, hey, hey.

640
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:16,910
I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.

641
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:20,540
I'm hot.
Is anyone else hot?

642
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,740
Are you hurt?

643
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,980
- Sir, excuse me.
- No! Shh!

644
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,670
Wait,
where are you going? Eddie?

645
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,270
This is unacceptable.
I'm gonna call the police.

646
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,710
What are you doing?
No, please don't.

647
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,270
- No.
- Eddie, please.

648
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,370
Oh, my God.

649
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,640
Ah.

650
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,840
- Now I'm gonna call the police.
- No, no. Please don't call the police.

651
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,240
Here, call an ambulance. I'm a doctor.
This man is my, um...

652
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,610
Patient.

653
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,270
Oh, it's much better.

654
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,680
You are insane.

655
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,980
- He's killing people.
- Who's killing people?

656
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,610
- Carlton Drake.
- Oh, God, Eddie,

657
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:49,780
- not this again.
- Yes, he is. He is!

658
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,310
And I have proof!

659
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,540
Ugh.

660
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,440
- Hey, Eddie...
- Hmm?

661
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,780
Eddie.

662
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,380
Eddie?

663
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:13,850
Eddie, can you hear me?

664
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,380
This is Dan speaking to you.

665
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,340
Hey, Dan.

666
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,810
- <i>Welcome back.</i>
- Where am I?

667
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:23,280
<i>Uh, you're in the MRI.</i>

668
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,840
<i>Okay, we've given you
a little sedative.</i>

669
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:27,610
- Where is Anne?
- <i>Anne is not here right now.</i>

670
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,010
<i>We're gonna run
some tests, okay?</i>

671
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,510
<i>It's gonna be completely
painless.</i>

672
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,340
<i>So, you know,
just try to stay still.</i>

673
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,010
<i>Uh, relax, and, um...</i>

674
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,310
<i>Yeah, here we go.</i>

675
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,840
Eddie, what's happening
in there?

676
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,440
<i>Eddie, you okay?</i>

677
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,440
Shut it down.

678
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:54,510
Hey, hey, hey.

679
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,710
You're okay. Yeah.

680
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,850
Coming out. You all right?

681
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,440
- Yeah.
- Here, look at me, look at me.

682
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:00,940
- You okay?
- Yeah.

683
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,880
- All right.
- Just take a deep breath. Okay? You're okay.

684
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,880
Yeah.

685
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,680
<i>Now, listen, you're not the
first person to freak out in there.</i>

686
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,510
I get claustrophobic, too.

687
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,010
Dr. Lewis?

688
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,380
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mrs. Manfredi. How are you?

689
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,950
Oh, I just saw Morris.

690
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,010
And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.

691
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,980
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank you so much.

692
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,280
Yeah, my pleasure.

693
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,980
Okay, Mrs. Manfredi,
we talked about the dog.

694
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,580
Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.

695
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,650
Sorry. Gemini.

696
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,280
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.

697
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,710
- But for now, go home, get some rest.
- Uh-huh.

698
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,280
I'll call you when
your tests are in.

699
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,610
- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.

700
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,750
- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.

701
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,750
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.

702
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,980
Did you have
the same reactions

703
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,650
regardless
of the temperature...

704
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:45,250
Good afternoon,
Dr. Skirth.

705
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,580
The creature
and the host are one.

706
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,010
Everything was fine.

707
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,850
So, why does the human
continue to waste away?

708
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:59,850
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

709
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,380
But the organism
is unaffected?

710
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,750
- The Symbiote is thriving.
- Good.

711
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,950
But once again,
it's killing the host.

712
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:05,980
It's consuming his organs.

713
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,650
Oh, watch this.

714
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,650
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!

715
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:19,550
Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.

716
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,980
- Well, then don't make those sounds.
- Okay.

717
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,280
He was stabilizing.
What happened?

718
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,420
He's approaching
acute liver failure.

719
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,510
We're gonna need another host.

720
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,550
Such poor design.

721
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:34,380
- Excuse me?
- Human beings.

722
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,650
Sorry to interrupt.

723
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,020
Thought you'd like
some good news.

724
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,950
I'm sorry.

725
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,020
<i>Hungry!</i>

726
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,410
Oh, goddamn.

727
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,310
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

728
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,510
Can I get through, please?
Excuse me.

729
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,810
Thank you.

730
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,380
I'm just gonna stay here,
all right?

731
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,950
Until the cable car stops.

732
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,980
We're good.
All right. Thank you.

733
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,980
Excuse me.

734
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,380
Oh, hey, Anne.

735
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,350
Eddie, hi. How you feeling?

736
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:26,020
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

737
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,350
Well, Eddie,
you have a parasite.

738
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,980
They're not exactly sure
how you got it,

739
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,950
but it would
explain the fever.

740
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,550
<i>That would make sense.</i>

741
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:38,420
Also, I'm hearing,
uh, a voice.

742
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,320
<i>Auditory hallucinations
are actually very common.</i>

743
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,680
Oh, hey, Dan.
How you doing?

744
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,320
<i>I didn't realize that
you were on the call, too.</i>

745
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,550
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Mmm.

746
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,450
Hey, Dan,
would this parasite...

747
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,380
Would it, like, be able to
make me, I don't know...

748
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,520
Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,

749
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,550
but super, super fast?

750
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,320
<i>Yes. We just did.</i>

751
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,680
<i>Uh, well, Eddie,
it sounds like</i>

752
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:59,550
it might be causing
some metabolic abnormalities

753
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,720
that are making it hard for your
body to maintain homeostasis.

754
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,620
You said "causing" and "body,"
and... I lost you.

755
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,580
Listen, Eddie, um, we are
gonna get you on some meds,

756
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:07,920
and we are gonna
clear that out.

757
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,480
- Yes.
- <i>Never gonna happen.</i>

758
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:11,990
Will you stop doing that now.
Not now.

759
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,880
- Eddie, we're just trying to help you.
- <i>I know.</i>

760
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,420
I know. I'm just, I'm not
actually talking to you, Annie.

761
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,880
Who are you talking to?

762
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,780
I'm just gonna call you back,
all right?

763
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:22,680
Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.

764
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,420
Yeah?

765
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,990
Hey, can you turn
your music down, please?

766
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,950
'Cause I'm having
a really hard time.

767
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,450
Whatever.

768
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:49,380
Yeah, sure, man. Yeah.

769
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,590
- I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

770
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:56,320
I was troubled by

771
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:58,950
what we've been doing.

772
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,020
I get it.

773
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,720
We've all been troubled.

774
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,290
It's the nature
of what we do.

775
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,990
But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.

776
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:14,990
I need that from you.

777
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,520
I can't do that.

778
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,960
We can't fix things
unless we begin with

779
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,250
your friend.

780
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,320
The person who was here.

781
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,620
Because they're gonna die.
They're in grave danger.

782
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,850
You know that, right?

783
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,350
They're gonna die unless
we bring them back here,

784
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,620
where you can help
to keep them alive.

785
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,290
Hey. Dora.

786
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:47,760
I promise, from here on in,
we will do things differently.

787
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:52,290
Will you trust me?

788
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,820
Eddie Brock.

789
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,990
- Eddie Brock?
- Mmm-hmm.

790
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,320
You were our best.

791
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,650
Open it.

792
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:20,990
No! No!

793
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:22,990
No! No! No!

794
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,590
<i>Do not open that door.</i>

795
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,420
Huh?

796
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:46,960
Stay put.

797
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,820
- Hey, Eddie.
- <i>Who the hell is this guy?</i>

798
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,020
I'm gonna need
Mr. Drake's property back.

799
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:52,960
Whoa.

800
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,720
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- I'm, uh...

801
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,420
I'm putting my hands up.

802
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,720
<i>You are making us
look bad.</i>

803
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,690
I...
No, I am not.

804
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:03,990
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

805
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,620
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Yes, you are!</i>

806
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,320
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Why would you do that?</i>

807
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,320
'Cause it is
a very sensible thing to do.

808
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,520
- Eddie...
- <i>I will take care of this myself.</i>

809
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,420
- What?
- Eddie, where's the bug?

810
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,020
Take him down.

811
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:28,790
I'm so sorry
about your friends.

812
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:39,990
- What is that?
- <i>Not "what." Who.</i>

813
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:42,830
Oh.

814
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:53,330
Shit.

815
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,560
<i>Outstanding.</i>

816
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,590
<i>Now let's bite all their heads off
and pile them up in the corner.</i>

817
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:20,690
Why would we do that?

818
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:23,490
<i>Pile of bodies, pile of heads.</i>

819
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,330
What the shit, man?

820
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,930
No! No, no, no!

821
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,730
- What the hell?
- Dude! How did you do that?

822
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:50,990
Apparently, I have a parasite.

823
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,000
Mr. Drake, our subject
is carrying the Symbiote.

824
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:03,660
<i>Connecting you
to the feed now.</i>

825
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,530
He's achieved symbiosis.

826
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:11,960
Are you seeing this?

827
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,960
Are you seeing this?
He's achieved symbiosis!

828
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,960
Treece...

829
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,960
Treece, bring me back
my creature.

830
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:28,660
<i>Eddie.</i>

831
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:40,690
You're not even here, are you?
I'm just seeing things.

832
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,790
It's not real.
You're in my head.

833
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,360
'Cause you're just a parasite.

834
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,400
"Parasite"?

835
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,660
You have a brain tumor, Eddie.

836
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,630
I got him. He's in the alley
behind the Schueller Building.

837
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:02,430
I am sorry that I
called you a parasite.

838
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:04,830
We can discuss this
like two men.

839
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,330
What is that? What is that?

840
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,830
What?

841
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:19,290
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me, Treece?

842
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,830
<i>Copy.
Weapons are armed and ready.</i>

843
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:22,930
Launch the drones.

844
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,400
<i>Duck.</i>

845
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,400
Whew!

846
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,300
- Thank you.
- <i>You are welcome.</i>

847
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:07,500
Oh!

848
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:18,000
This is beyond
anything we thought was possible.

849
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,570
Oh, God, no!

850
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:50,560
Holy shit!

851
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,830
Treece, do not
let him get away.

852
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:02,300
I've got him.
All ground vehicles, move in.

853
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,530
Target is now eastbound
on Grant.

854
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,330
Oh, God! Do something!

855
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:21,870
What the...

856
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,840
Oh, yeah! We got more friends.
Awesome.

857
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
No, no, no! No, no!

858
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:40,370
No! You're out of your mind!

859
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,770
No!

860
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,570
- That is a dead-end!
- <i>Not for us.</i>

861
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:10,370
Whoa!

862
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,540
Yeah!

863
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:48,640
Whoa!

864
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:56,900
I am going to die!

865
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,340
<i>You are not
going to die!</i>

866
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,710
Whoa! That was pretty cool,
actually. I'm not gonna lie...

867
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,500
I got him.

868
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:24,570
- <i>Bring him home.</i>
- Copy that.

869
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,510
This is incredible.

870
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:35,700
You have been a serious
pain in the ass for me, Eddie.

871
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:38,740
Well, you know,
I aim to please.

872
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:54,500
Eyes, lungs, pancreas.

873
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:56,970
So many snacks,
so little time.

874
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,540
SFPD. Don't move!

875
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,710
Get off the car!

876
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:28,510
My legs.

877
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,640
Oh, my God,
my legs were broken.

878
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,040
Now they're not broken.
What is happening?

879
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,310
What the hell
are you?

880
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:54,770
I am Venom.

881
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,540
And you are mine.

882
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,910
You bit somebody's head off.

883
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:01,970
Fuel in the tank.

884
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,010
Listen carefully, Eddie.

885
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,470
You did not find us.

886
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,040
We found you.

887
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,310
Think of yourself
as my ride.

888
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,570
Where are you going?

889
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:15,670
We need
Carlton Drake's rocket.

890
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,640
You remember him.

891
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,040
How do you even know
about that?

892
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,540
- I know everything, Eddie.
- You do?

893
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,370
- Everything about you.
- How?

894
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:25,810
I am inside your head.

895
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:28,370
You are a loser, Eddie.

896
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,710
Are you gonna eat
anybody else?

897
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:37,010
Most likely.

898
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:38,470
Oh, God.

899
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,470
That is why we are here.

900
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,780
Cooperate,
and you might just survive.

901
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:48,040
That is the deal.

902
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:52,880
<i>Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

903
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,780
<i>Welcome to San Francisco.</i>

904
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,680
<i>For your safety and comfort,
please remain seated...</i>

905
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,480
Hey, babe. I'm almost home.

906
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,310
- <i>Where's Eddie?</i>
- Why? What's happening?

907
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,380
I got Eddie's labs back,

908
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:26,710
and it's worse than I thought.

909
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:29,880
His systems, renal, endocrine,
they're behaving abnormally.

910
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,610
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

911
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:33,410
What does that mean, Dan?
What are you telling me?

912
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:35,040
- You need to get him here.
- <i>My God.</i>

913
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:40,840
- <i>Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.</i>
- Shit.

914
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:50,710
Where were you when
it left Dr. Skirth's body?

915
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,880
- Where was he?
- I was...

916
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,880
This is the higher life-form. You
stood by and watched while it died.

917
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:58,950
The arrogance.

918
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:08,910
Treece, listen to me. After this,
we can't risk killing Brock,

919
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:11,050
not until we find
another suitable host.

920
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,680
I don't want to see you again
unless you have Brock!

921
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:22,680
Officer, what's happening?
I need to get in there.

922
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,780
- It's my friend's apartment.
- Building's been evacuated.

923
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:25,840
It's not safe for you
to be here, ma'am.

924
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:27,780
Found another one, Bill.

925
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,680
Get off the streets.
Go home.

926
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,380
There's bodies
all over the city tonight.

927
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,410
Bodies?

928
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,810
My God, Eddie,
where are you?

929
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:40,780
<i>Who is Anne?
Your pulse has quickened.</i>

930
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,710
That is none of your
goddamn business.

931
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:45,050
<i>Everything of yours
is my business, Eddie.</i>

932
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,840
<i>We have no secrets.</i>

933
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,480
Yeah? Well, then you know
exactly why I'm going here

934
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,980
before we get to your rocket,
huh?

935
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:53,510
<i>Sure.
I'm not unreasonable.</i>

936
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:55,310
Shit. Yeah?

937
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:57,050
Eddie. Thank God. Where are you?
I need to see you.

938
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,010
No, no, you can't see me.

939
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:01,310
Eddie, I need you to tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

940
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:02,880
No, you cannot come
anywhere near me.

941
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,450
You cannot come
near me right now.

942
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:07,010
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
- <i>No!</i>

943
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,750
- Eddie?
- <i>No, I gotta go up there.</i>

944
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:09,780
You know you're not
supposed to be here, Eddie.

945
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,050
I got to get up there, man.

946
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,350
Look, I got love for you, bro,
but no can do.

947
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:14,710
There's no such thing
as can't.

948
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,880
I'm sorry, man.

949
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:19,310
Okay, okay... Uh...

950
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:21,610
Can you, uh,
just give him this?

951
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:24,550
- He needs to see what's on it.
- Eddie, please. I really need this job.

952
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,850
- <i>Let's eat his brains.</i>
- No! You do not touch him!

953
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,850
- He is my friend.
- What's wrong with you?

954
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:30,910
He works three jobs just so
that he can support his family.

955
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,410
- Eddie, what's going on?
- We're leaving.

956
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:33,950
- <i>"We"?</i>
- Yeah.

957
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,520
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

958
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,550
Yeah.

959
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:47,850
- Shit.
- <i>You want up?</i>

960
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,950
<i>Well, why didn't you just say?</i>

961
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,050
Hmm.

962
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,480
- It is peaceful up here.
- <i>I'm not very good with heights.</i>

963
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,680
Your world is not so ugly
after all.

964
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,020
I'm almost sorry
to see it end.

965
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,410
<i>What does that mean?</i>

966
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,380
Where'd you go?
Where did you go?

967
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,680
<i>I got us.</i>

968
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,780
Whoa.

969
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,820
Again?
You're gonna get me killed.

970
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,950
<i>You die, I die.</i>

971
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:55,350
Yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

972
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,850
and exchange it for another
one whenever you need.

973
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,750
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

974
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,750
<i>You are far too good of a
match to throw away so soon.</i>

975
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:04,920
<i>Plus, I am starting
to like you.</i>

976
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,380
<i>You and I
are not so different.</i>

977
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,050
Thank you.

978
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:12,950
Okay.

979
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,420
Here's your evidence.

980
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:21,550
<i>Jump.</i>

981
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:25,720
<i>Pussy.</i>

982
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:36,950
Hands!

983
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:40,620
On the ground! Now!

984
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:47,850
Guys, you do not want to do this.
Trust me.

985
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:49,920
- Mask!
- Copy!

986
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,420
All right,
have it your own way.

987
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,050
- Mask!
- <i>Copy.</i>

988
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:55,820
What the hell
is that thing?

989
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,590
What the hell?

990
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:05,420
Hold your fire!

991
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,550
Flares!

992
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:08,650
He's there!
He's there!

993
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:09,850
Reload!

994
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:12,680
Anybody see him?

995
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:25,520
Does anyone have eyes on him?

996
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,350
<i>Switching to
thermal. Seeking target.</i>

997
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:44,690
I don't have
eyes on him.

998
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:47,450
Where is it?

999
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:55,550
Flash grenade!

1000
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:57,950
Throw them!

1001
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,490
Flash grenade!

1002
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,790
He's in the rafters!

1003
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:12,850
Above!

1004
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:19,320
There he is!

1005
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,390
Move, move, move!

1006
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,020
<i>No! We do not
eat policemen!</i>

1007
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:04,890
Annie! Annie, wait!

1008
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:06,720
- Wait, please.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

1009
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,390
That's not me.
I've been infected.

1010
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:11,860
- Eddie, what's happening?
- He's inside me.

1011
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,460
- "He"?
- Yes.

1012
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:15,890
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- You're sick.

1013
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:18,590
- Eddie, you're really sick.
- No, I am scared!

1014
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,660
- And I need help.
- Hospital.

1015
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:28,420
Right now.

1016
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:34,420
I can't go with you.
It's not safe.

1017
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:35,490
Get in the car, Eddie.

1018
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:40,660
- In the back.
- <i>I like her. Get in.</i>

1019
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:49,830
I'm out of control.

1020
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:52,990
Dan just needs to do
another MRI.

1021
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:54,830
- <i>No MRI.</i>
- No. No. No MRI.

1022
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:57,030
What? Why?

1023
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,360
<i>Sound at 4,000
to 6,000 hertz is lethal.</i>

1024
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:04,690
Sound frequency in the MRI
is really harmful for him.

1025
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:07,490
What, so, sound
is like his kryptonite?

1026
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:10,060
- Not all sounds.
- <i>And fire.</i>

1027
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:13,330
Fire. And fire.
He's talking to you?

1028
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:16,360
Always.

1029
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:19,630
- Are you in pain?
- No.

1030
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:22,320
No, I don't feel anything,
actually, apart from...

1031
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:24,620
I'm hungry all the time.

1032
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:27,960
<i>And you feel sad, do you
not, Eddie, when you are with her?</i>

1033
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:30,960
Get out of my head, man.

1034
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,420
<i>You never apologized.</i>

1035
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:36,030
<i>You might not live
to get another chance.</i>

1036
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:43,720
Annie.

1037
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:47,390
I just want to say
that whatever happens,

1038
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:53,390
that I am truly sorry for whatever...
And everything I have ever done to you.

1039
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,990
I am truly, truly sorry.

1040
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:58,460
And that I love you.

1041
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:01,660
Oh, Eddie...

1042
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:04,760
Now's really not the time. Let's
just keep you alive, okay?

1043
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,390
<i>Aw, that's nice.</i>

1044
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:15,490
You know, I'm really wet and
cold. Can I, uh, wear this?

1045
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:18,690
Yeah, yeah, you can wear
whatever you want.

1046
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:19,760
Thank you.

1047
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,400
Hello?

1048
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,930
What are you doing here?

1049
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:56,630
Are you lost?

1050
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,800
I'm not lost.

1051
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,860
Thanks for coming in.

1052
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:13,360
- Eddie, I'm sorry.
- What?

1053
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,030
Eddie, I got your labs back, and
your heart has atrophied severely.

1054
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,760
<i>Do not listen to him.
I can fix it.</i>

1055
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,060
I don't want you to fix it.

1056
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:21,630
<i>I can heal you.</i>

1057
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:25,530
Can you fix it?

1058
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,460
No. I've never seen
anything like this before.

1059
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:29,660
- This parasite, whatever this is...
- <i>"Parasite"?</i>

1060
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,960
It's eating you
from the inside.

1061
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,600
Not a parasite.
He's not.

1062
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,700
- You're using him up.
- <i>No. She is wrong.</i>

1063
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:37,730
- We need to get you to the ICU.
- Wait. Shh!

1064
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:40,330
- I, Eddie, am I dying?
- <i>No!</i>

1065
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:41,930
You're killing him.

1066
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,400
<i>They do not know
what they are talking about.</i>

1067
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,960
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time...

1068
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,500
- Oh, God!
- <i>We have to get out of here.</i>

1069
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:48,900
- Stop!
- Oh, God, he's killing you.

1070
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,030
I'm killing you.
I'm so sorry.

1071
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,600
No! Don't do that!

1072
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:13,800
Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.

1073
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,070
What is that?

1074
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:25,000
You were killing me?

1075
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,070
What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?

1076
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:34,570
Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.

1077
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,930
We're done.

1078
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,660
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere other than here.

1079
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:43,430
You don't think we have
a little problem on our hands?

1080
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:45,430
Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.

1081
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:49,900
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1082
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:53,800
I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,

1083
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,030
but I don't know
much more than you do.

1084
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:59,000
I guess he had
no one else to turn to.

1085
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,730
He's a very complicated man.
But, Dan, I promise,

1086
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:04,460
there's nothing going on
between me and Eddie.

1087
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:06,600
I'm not talking
about you and Eddie, Anne.

1088
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,870
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

1089
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:12,670
Dan.

1090
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,730
Where is it?

1091
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,640
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

1092
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:18,430
You can kill me,
'cause I'm dying anyway.

1093
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:23,030
I'm not just gonna kill you.
That wouldn't be any fun.

1094
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:27,070
No, no, no. I'm gonna rip your
tongue out of your face.

1095
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,600
Whoo!

1096
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:34,940
Stop. You're bleeding
all over my lab. Go. Go!

1097
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,570
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1098
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:49,600
And you know what? Even if I
did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

1099
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,500
I don't trust you,
and you're insane.

1100
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,430
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

1101
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,900
Long journal entry
about that tonight.

1102
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,670
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

1103
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:01,840
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

1104
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,400
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

1105
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,840
It can't go on.

1106
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,370
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

1107
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:10,370
We're parasites.
You're a good example.

1108
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:12,040
Think about it.
All you do is take.

1109
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:15,970
You took my Symbiote. You
take potshots at a great man

1110
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,770
- trying to get something done.
- Who?

1111
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,970
Didn't you take from the
person you loved the most,

1112
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:24,470
who trusted you the most?
That's insane.

1113
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:28,970
What I've initiated is a whole
new world, a new species.

1114
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:31,400
Man and Symbiote combined.

1115
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,970
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

1116
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:37,040
Because I have spent a significant
amount of time, all right,

1117
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,440
with one of these creatures
up my ass.

1118
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:41,740
It's not a lot of fun.

1119
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:44,340
And then I find out,
all along,

1120
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:45,740
that they're killing you.

1121
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:47,470
This is the last time
I'm asking you.

1122
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:50,000
- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.

1123
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:52,540
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God!

1124
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:54,040
Where's Venom?

1125
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:57,840
That is the ugliest-looking
thing I have ever seen.

1126
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:07,700
You know, Brock,
I have no use for you.

1127
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,370
Treece! Come and clean up
your mess.

1128
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:14,600
Whoa, he has one
up his ass, too.

1129
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:28,040
Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.

1130
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:31,670
There are more of us.
Millions more.

1131
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,870
They will follow
wherever I lead.

1132
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:37,670
Where we lead.

1133
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:39,400
Yes, "we."

1134
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:42,670
But first,
we must retrieve them.

1135
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,610
I can take care of that.

1136
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,640
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?

1137
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,640
Shut up.

1138
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:00,070
Not so tough
without your friend.

1139
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:06,640
Did your mama not love you?

1140
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,010
God damn it!

1141
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:16,040
I guess it
pays to be a specialist, huh?

1142
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,040
You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,

1143
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,810
because there's something
way bigger afoot

1144
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:20,870
in this world than you and me.

1145
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:24,040
Much bigger than me.

1146
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:28,540
And it's much,
much bigger than you.

1147
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:32,740
Karma's a bitch.

1148
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:33,980
I don't believe in karma.

1149
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:37,710
Oh! Ooh!

1150
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:43,470
Hi, Eddie.

1151
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,510
Whoa. Whoa...

1152
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:48,340
Oh...

1153
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:49,340
Mmm...

1154
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:51,580
Mmm!

1155
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:08,980
Oh, no.

1156
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:12,970
I just bit
that guy's head off.

1157
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,480
I know, I know. I've been there, too.
It's not fun.

1158
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,080
- <i>The one with Drake is Riot.</i>
- Who's Riot?

1159
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:20,810
<i>Riot is what you would call
a team leader.</i>

1160
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:22,870
<i>He has an arsenal of weapons.</i>

1161
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,080
- Drake's got his own Symbiote.
- <i>He is unstoppable.</i>

1162
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:26,870
- Oh, great.
- <i>We have got to go!</i>

1163
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,580
Go where? Where we going?

1164
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:30,010
- Well, I'm coming with you.
- <i>No!</i>

1165
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,910
<i>It's going to get ugly.</i>

1166
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:34,010
- Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.
- Yeah, I can fight ugly.

1167
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:37,340
Not today.

1168
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:40,410
Oh, that's bullshit!

1169
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:44,080
This is not a simulation.

1170
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:46,480
Well, the flight team
aren't prepped yet.

1171
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,910
I'll be piloting
the spacecraft.

1172
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:50,640
- You?
- Yes, me.

1173
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,340
How long?

1174
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:54,040
We're loading the probe
and running diagnostics.

1175
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:57,410
But even fully automated, you
can't pilot that craft all alone.

1176
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:00,750
I'm not alone.

1177
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:07,680
God damn it! What the hell
happened there? We just left Annie.

1178
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,640
<i>It is not safe for her.</i>

1179
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:11,050
<i>If we do not stop Riot,</i>

1180
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,680
<i>he will come back here
with millions more of my kind.</i>

1181
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:19,040
Millions? What, you were
gonna take the rocket,

1182
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:21,080
and you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

1183
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:23,010
Then what were you gonna do,
you were gonna go feed

1184
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:24,780
- on a whole planet?
- <i>Yes!</i>

1185
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,980
<i>But it is
different now, Eddie.</i>

1186
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:29,540
- <i>I have decided to stay.</i>
- Wow!

1187
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:32,580
<i>On my planet, I am
kind of a loser, like you.</i>

1188
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:35,080
- <i>But here, we could be more.</i>
- Excuse me?

1189
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:37,040
<i>And I'm getting to
like it here.</i>

1190
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:39,710
Oh, you like us now,
do you, huh?

1191
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:42,340
<i>However, there will be nothing left to
like if we do not stop that rocket.</i>

1192
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:46,080
Oh, I see. Right. When it comes
to being completely annihilated,

1193
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:48,440
- then it's back to "we."
- <i>It is "we."</i>

1194
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,840
<i>Like it or not, it is
going to take both of us.</i>

1195
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:52,550
Hey, come on, man.
Cut the bullshit.

1196
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:54,010
What really made you
change your mind?

1197
01:19:57,810 --> 01:20:00,780
You. You did, Eddie.

1198
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:05,440
Scrub diagnostics.

1199
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:07,810
- Sir?
- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch.

1200
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:17,580
<i>T-minus
five minutes to launch.</i>

1201
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,910
<i>Auto sequence has been
initiated.</i>

1202
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:33,980
Oh, shit.

1203
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:46,480
<i>T-minus
four minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1204
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:57,710
<i>Oh, Jesus!
You can take this guy, right?</i>

1205
01:20:57,710 --> 01:21:00,410
He has got shit
you have never seen.

1206
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:02,510
<i>What does that mean?
What are our chances?</i>

1207
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:05,950
Hmm. Pretty much zero.

1208
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:08,850
<i>Oh, fuck it. Well,
let's go save the planet.</i>

1209
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:13,950
<i>T-minus four minutes.</i>

1210
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:20,450
<i>Initiate orbiter
aerosurface profile.</i>

1211
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,550
Venom. Get in the rocket.

1212
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:30,680
No. We won't let you destroy
this world.

1213
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,020
Then die.

1214
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:44,750
- <i>Holy shit!</i>
- Told you.

1215
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:46,380
<i>T-minus three minutes.</i>

1216
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:00,350
You have a strong host.

1217
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:03,950
But not strong enough.

1218
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:45,420
<i>T-minus
two minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1219
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:48,750
Eddie.

1220
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:54,650
Drake, stop!

1221
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:03,320
Told you I could fight ugly.

1222
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:12,760
<i>T-minus one minute.</i>

1223
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,420
You're too late.

1224
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:33,420
This is the next stage...

1225
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:37,720
You talk too much.

1226
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,060
<i>T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

1227
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:50,920
You are nothing.

1228
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,860
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

1229
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:22,760
<i>Nine...</i>

1230
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:24,660
<i>Eight...</i>

1231
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:26,590
<i>Seven...</i>

1232
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:28,360
<i>Six...</i>

1233
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:29,920
<i>Five...</i>

1234
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,350
<i>Four...</i>

1235
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,890
<i>Three...</i>

1236
01:25:33,890 --> 01:25:35,760
<i>Two...</i>

1237
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,760
<i>One...</i>

1238
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,720
<i>Liftoff.</i>

1239
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,690
Traitor!

1240
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:51,460
Have a nice life.

1241
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,090
<i>Goodbye, Eddie.</i>

1242
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,790
Venom, no!

1243
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:13,220
Hmm. You're in luck. I've
decided to work pro bono.

1244
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:15,220
I'm joining
the public defenders' office.

1245
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:17,190
You're a good person, Annie.

1246
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:18,690
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

1247
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:20,520
Uh, the network asked me
to bring the show back,

1248
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,560
and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.

1249
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,660
Oh, wow, really?
So, what did you say?

1250
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:29,090
Uh, I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.

1251
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:31,190
I scored the interview
of a lifetime.

1252
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:33,520
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.

1253
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:36,160
Oh! Like everyone else.

1254
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,160
Yeah.

1255
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:41,830
Hey, I'm sorry about Venom.

1256
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,720
Hey, um...

1257
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:49,220
Do you want to talk
about that kiss?

1258
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:52,430
Oh, that? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...

1259
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:57,790
Uh, that was your
buddy's idea.

1260
01:27:57,790 --> 01:28:00,190
Oh, right. Well,
that is good to know.

1261
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:05,060
- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?

1262
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:07,120
I mean, the...

1263
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:10,660
- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...

1264
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,220
- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.

1265
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:13,330
Okay.

1266
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:16,220
- Hey, Eddie?
- Mmm-hmm?

1267
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:18,460
We're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?

1268
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:22,190
<i>Look at her. She has no
idea we are going to get her back.</i>

1269
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:25,120
No, I don't think so.

1270
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:27,590
- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.

1271
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:29,390
Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?

1272
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:31,790
- Nope.
- <i>You belong with us, Annie.</i>

1273
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:33,560
Eddie, are you sure?

1274
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,560
Good Lord, look at that.

1275
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,690
- Look at the time.
- I have to go.

1276
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:41,630
- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

1277
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:43,760
You take care, all right?

1278
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:45,830
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.

1279
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,190
Hey. Don't give up on her.

1280
01:28:53,190 --> 01:28:54,360
Either of you.

1281
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:56,460
We won't.

1282
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:58,160
- <i>Who is that guy?</i>
- Okay.

1283
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,730
<i>Wait.
This thing looks delicious.</i>

1284
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:03,390
I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,

1285
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:06,330
but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?

1286
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:10,090
You cannot just go around eating
anybody that you want to.

1287
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:11,830
- <i>I cannot?</i>
- No, you cannot.

1288
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,760
All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.

1289
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,330
There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

1290
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:19,630
And then there are bad people.

1291
01:29:19,630 --> 01:29:21,490
You have to tell
the difference.

1292
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:25,360
The deal is, you will only
ever be allowed to touch,

1293
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,730
harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,

1294
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:31,160
eat very, very bad people,

1295
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,830
but never, ever,
ever good people. All right?

1296
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:36,430
- <i>Fine.</i>
- Good.

1297
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:38,190
<i>But how does one
tell the difference?</i>

1298
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,290
Well, it's super simple.

1299
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:43,190
I mean, you just have to... You
can intuit it, you can sense it.

1300
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,260
Sometimes you can
even feel it.

1301
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:46,690
<i>Whatever you say.</i>

1302
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:48,760
<i>But can we get something to
eat now?</i>

1303
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:54,190
<i>Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.</i>

1304
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:56,500
Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.

1305
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,360
Hey, Mrs. C.

1306
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:03,130
How you doing, Eddie?

1307
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:04,700
Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.

1308
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:07,660
No.

1309
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:10,800
So, what culinary delights will
tickle the pickle tonight?

1310
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:12,690
<i>Tater tots
and chocolate.</i>

1311
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,360
Right. Okay, no problem.

1312
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:17,200
The payment's due, Chen.

1313
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:20,690
Please.
I can't keep doing this.

1314
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:22,260
Now.

1315
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:23,830
- <i>Bad guy, right?</i>
- Yep.

1316
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,430
You come in here again...

1317
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:38,090
In fact, you go anywhere in this
city, preying on innocent people,

1318
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:41,600
and we will find you
and eat both your arms

1319
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,600
- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.

1320
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,660
And then we will eat your face right
off your head. Do you understand?

1321
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:48,560
- Please...
- Yes.

1322
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:52,460
So, you will be this armless,
legless, faceless thing, won't you,

1323
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:57,230
rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?

1324
01:30:57,230 --> 01:30:59,600
- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?

1325
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:04,060
We are Venom.

1326
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,670
- On second thought...
- Please.

1327
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:17,130
Eddie? What was that?

1328
01:31:17,130 --> 01:31:18,530
Oh...

1329
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:22,330
I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. Chen.

1330
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:25,200
- <i>"Parasite"?</i>
- Yeah.

1331
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,200
It's a term of endearment,
that's all.

1332
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,200
- <i>Apologize!</i>
- No.

1333
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,130
- <i>Apologize!</i>
- All right, fine.

1334
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:34,830
I'm sorry. So, what do you
want to do now?

1335
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:39,200
<i>The way I see it,
we can do whatever we want.</i>

1336
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,270
I need you
to stay quiet.

1337
01:34:08,270 --> 01:34:11,240
This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.

1338
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:14,370
- You got that?
- <i>Fine, but make it quick.</i>

1339
01:34:18,710 --> 01:34:20,270
Open on five.

1340
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:23,400
Go. Opening up.

1341
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:28,170
You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.

1342
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:30,700
Second he asked
for you to interview him,

1343
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:32,440
I'd have shut that
shit down.

1344
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,600
Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage

1345
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:37,240
of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.

1346
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:40,370
They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.

1347
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:43,810
FBI don't work up close
and personal with him.

1348
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:47,510
The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.

1349
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:53,470
Hey, Red!
I got a visitor for you.

1350
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:16,240
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

1351
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:20,670
Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?

1352
01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:21,840
Sure, it's good with me.

1353
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:24,400
I mean, I can turn it on
if you want.

1354
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:31,270
I can talk about the Dadaist
patterns of arterial spray.

1355
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:33,340
I bet you can.

1356
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:35,810
Tough to see you
in this light, Eddie.

1357
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:37,670
Come on over.

1358
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:40,110
All right.

1359
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:46,440
I'm here.

1360
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:50,170
When I get out of here,
and I will,

1361
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:53,470
there's gonna be carnage.

1362
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:05,430
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

1363
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:09,200
I want to do what you asked.

1364
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,830
I really do.

1365
01:48:10,830 --> 01:48:13,130
But... I'm sorry.

1366
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:19,800
I can't do this without you.

1367
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:22,330
Hey, kid...

1368
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:23,630
Whoa.

1369
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:24,630
What was... Whoa!

1370
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:29,500
What?

1371
01:48:31,530 --> 01:48:32,570
Huh?

1372
01:48:41,170 --> 01:48:42,170
No.

1373
01:48:46,430 --> 01:48:48,360
Who are you?

1374
01:48:48,370 --> 01:48:49,370
What are you
doing over there?

1375
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:52,530
Freeze! PDNY.

1376
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:54,530
Kid, freeze!

1377
01:48:58,170 --> 01:48:59,300
You're kidding me right now?

1378
01:49:01,370 --> 01:49:02,770
Hey, kid.
Drop the body.

1379
01:49:11,770 --> 01:49:13,160
Ow!

1380
01:49:13,170 --> 01:49:14,370
Somebody stop that train!

1381
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:27,870
Aah!

1382
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,300
Sorry.

1383
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:49,770
<i>...looks like
a child dressed like Spider-Man,</i>

1384
01:49:49,770 --> 01:49:51,300
<i>dragging a homeless corpse</i>

1385
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:52,600
<i>behind a train.</i>

1386
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:53,830
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1387
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:55,400
Why are you
trying to kill me?

1388
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:56,800
I'm not.
I'm trying to save you.

1389
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:19,600
Hey, maybe you guys
can go around?

1390
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:22,130
All right.
Thanks, New York.

1391
01:50:22,140 --> 01:50:27,140
