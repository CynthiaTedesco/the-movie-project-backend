1
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:09,570
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,580
--spring training camp and
he's definitely got the inside track.

3
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:37,270
Robert.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,330
Word is that they're having
some problems with injuries.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,080
Really? Are they looking into...

6
01:44:37,570 --> 01:44:40,320
-What are you doing?
-The cure is in her blood.

7
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:47,360
Coal chute. I think it'll be safe.
Ethan, get in!

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,580
...free-agent signings last second,
anything like that?

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,080
Possibly, and they've got
a strong farm club too.

10
01:44:47,730 --> 01:44:49,110
-Go.
-Come on, get in.

11
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,080
They've got some triple-A ballplayers
they might bring up.

12
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:51,150
-Get in.
-Anna.

13
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,920
Peter would certainly be able
to tell us more about that.

14
01:44:54,810 --> 01:44:57,230
I think this is why you're here.

15
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,020
What are you doing?

16
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,420
Who do you like?

17
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,920
So far,
I like what I'm seeing in New York.

18
01:45:02,190 --> 01:45:04,230
I'm listening.

19
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,160
They've got a strong ball club, as usual.
That's in the American.

20
01:45:04,850 --> 01:45:06,690
-Neville, there's room. Come!
-No.

21
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,920
And in the National,
I'm still liking Chicago...

22
01:45:06,850 --> 01:45:09,810
They're not gonna stop.
They're not gonna stop.

23
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,540
...with a little bit of a twist here
for Los Angeles.

24
01:45:12,730 --> 01:45:14,060
Stay in till dawn.

25
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,580
Okay, so we're looking at
New York-Chicago World Series...

26
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:37,360
In 2009, a deadly virus
burned through our civilization...

27
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,370
-...possible Los Angeles.
Could be a dark horse.

28
01:47:37,530 --> 01:47:40,770
...pushing humankind
to the edge of extinction.

29
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,460
Hold him to it
at the end of the season.

30
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:43,900
Dr. Robert Neville dedicated his life...

31
01:47:44,150 --> 01:47:46,400
...to the discovery of a cure...

32
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,750
That's gonna do it for us
from the Sports Desk.

33
01:47:46,570 --> 01:47:49,320
...and the restoration of humanity.

34
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,790
-Back to the studio. Thanks, Dave.
Thanks for nothing, Eddie.

35
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:52,610
On September 9th, 2012...

36
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,580
Thank you, guys. That's not all we're
following. Here's Karen at the Health Desk.

37
01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:55,690
...at approximately 8:49 p.m...

38
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,160
The world of medicine
has seen its share of miracle cures...

39
01:47:55,850 --> 01:47:57,770
...he discovered that cure.

40
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,960
...from the polio vaccine
to heart transplants...

41
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:04,230
And at 8:52, he gave his life to defend it.

42
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,250
...but all past achievements may pale in
comparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.

43
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:07,770
We are his legacy.

44
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,250
Thank you for joining us this morning.

45
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:11,320
This is his legend.

46
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,250
-Not at all.
-So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

47
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:15,530
Light up the darkness.

48
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,120
Well, the premise is quite simple.

49
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,630
Take something designed by nature
and reprogram it...

50
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,160
...to make it work for the body
rather than against it.

51
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,960
-We're talking about a virus?
-Yes.

52
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,920
In this case, the measles virus...

53
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,250
...which has been engineered at a genetic
level to be helpful rather than harmful.

54
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,710
Um, I'm not-- I find the best way
to describe it is...

55
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,370
...if you can imagine your body
as a highway...

56
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,420
...and you picture the virus as a very fast
car being driven by a very bad man...

57
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,630
...imagine the damage that
that car could cause.

58
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,080
But then if you replace that man
with a cop...

59
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,580
...the picture changes. And that's
essentially what we've done.

60
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,040
Now, how many people
have you treated so far?

61
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,840
Well, we've had 10,009 clinical trials
in humans so far.

62
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,750
-And how many are cancer-free?
-Ten thousand and nine.

63
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,080
So you have actually cured cancer?

64
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,920
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.

65
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,670
What you see? What you see?

66
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,920
Damn.

67
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,120
Let's go, Sam.

68
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,540
Come on.

69
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,840
Good morning, Matt.
It's looking great, I'll tell you.

70
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,370
Not only was this the biggest
snowstorm in New York City history...

71
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,960
...it had to be one of the prettiest.
Imagine waking up on Sunday...

72
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,420
...to 26.9 inches of snow
in New York City.

73
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,880
Here you go. Just the way you like it.

74
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,120
Disgusting.

75
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,540
Excuse me, excuse me.

76
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,630
All right. Come on, relax.

77
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,080
However, it did strand
planes, trains and automobiles.

78
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,500
There was a report, a Turkish Airlines
flight skidded off the runway at JFK.

79
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,460
No one was injured,
but for the most part, Matt....

80
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,630
There you go.

81
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,160
I'm gonna show you, attempting
the Bob Hager rule of thumb here.

82
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,840
And I'm gonna plug my ruler in.

83
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,960
In New York, in 30 Rock,
we have 16 inches of snow, Matt.

84
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,500
Back to you, Matt and Katie.

85
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,080
Gosh. All right, it looks great. It'll be
beautiful for the next day, at least.

86
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,120
-And then it turns brown.
If that.

87
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,840
Anyway, Ann, thanks so much.

88
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,500
Mm-mm. No, no, no. Eat your vegetables.

89
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,750
Don't just push them around, eat them.
I'm not playing.

90
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,370
Good morning. This morning,
all up the East Coast....

91
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,420
Okay. You gonna eat your vegetables.
We will sit down here all night.

92
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,500
The biggest challenge
is getting back to work.

93
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,920
What are you whining about?
Why didn't you just eat your vegetables?

94
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,880
Hey. All right, here's the deal.
Look. Look.

95
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,840
You're gonna eat twice as many vegetables
tomorrow night. All right?

96
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,040
DeaI? DeaI?

97
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,370
Come on.

98
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,370
Don't worry about a thing

99
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,580
'Cause every little thing
Gonna be all right

100
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,960
I know that feels good.

101
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,670
Smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds

102
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,040
Ah, Sam.

103
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,040
Singin' sweet songs
Of melody--

104
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,080
I'm all right.

105
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,210
I'm all right, it's all right.

106
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,330
What's happening? I tried to reach you
on your cell. I get a recording.

107
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,250
-Cell service is down.
-Where are we going?

108
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,040
-Can't get used to the new regs.
ROBERT: Going to Aunt Sara's.

109
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,920
-Ma! No! Why?
-Baby, just strap yourself in. Go.

110
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,080
We're at 30 minutes, colonel.
-Copy.

111
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,000
-Thirty minutes to what?
-They're sealing off the island.

112
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,080
-Seal off the island? This island?
-But I don't wanna go to Aunt Sara's.

113
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,080
Did you bring all the money?
Yeah.

114
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,580
How much?
Six hundred.

115
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,040
Why did you say, "You're going"?

116
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,540
That's not enough.
-Robert.

117
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,670
You said, "You're going,"
not, "We're going."

118
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,710
When you get across, I need you to get
to the ATM. Get as much cash as you can.

119
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,670
Take Sara's car, go upstate.
I'll meet you at the farm.

120
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,920
Bring enough food for two weeks.

121
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,670
Jesus, Robert, did it jump?

122
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,540
is it airborne?

123
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,670
But we only go to Aunt Sara's
in the summer.

124
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,630
-It may be.
-Oh, my God.

125
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,540
-It's Christmas. What about my presents?
-He's announcing it.

126
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,080
Make no mistake, Americans, this virus--

127
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,160
You left my Christmas presents
in the closet.

128
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,330
Hush now, Mar.

129
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,250
--threatens the survival of not only our
nation, but of every other nation--

130
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,710
-Mommy, look, it's a butterfly.
-Marley, enough!

131
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,420
And so it is with great sadness,
but even greater resolve...

132
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,420
...that tonight I have signed
an executive order...

133
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,790
...initiating a military quarantine
of New York City.

134
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,920
God be with us.

135
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,160
This has been a special--

136
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,920
The window is still open. We find
something in a week or two weeks...

137
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,580
...we can reverse the spread.

138
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,960
I can still fix this.

139
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,920
Please. You can do the same work
outside the city.

140
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,880
This is ground zero. This is my site.
We talked about this.

141
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,710
What are you doing?

142
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,080
What am I doing?

143
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,460
I'm not gonna let this happen.

144
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,460
Let? This isn't up to you.
You can't control--

145
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,540
Ah! Daddy, it's a monster!

146
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,080
How'd you sleep?

147
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,370
Look out. Come on,
you know better than that.

148
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,040
Uh-uh.

149
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,790
I'll be back.

150
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:52,750
Dr. Robert Neville, September 5th, 2012,
GA series, serum 391.

151
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Animal trials. Streaming video.

152
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,460
GA series results appear typical.

153
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,960
Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10...

154
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,460
... 11, 14, 16, 18 did not kill the virus.

155
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,540
Compounds 2, 5, 7...

156
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,960
... 12, 13, 15, 17...

157
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,540
...all killed the host.

158
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,370
Hold on a second.

159
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,080
Compound 6 appears to be showing
decreased aggression response.

160
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,420
Partial pigmentation return.

161
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Slight pupil constriction.

162
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,000
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6...

163
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,210
...next candidate for human trials.

164
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,920
You hang in there, number six.

165
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,040
Yeah, that's what you want.

166
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,790
Hey!

167
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,880
Good morning, Marge.
Good morning, Fred.

168
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,580
What are you guys doing here so early?

169
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,370
That's a nice sweatshirt there, Fred.
Don't set it down anywhere.

170
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,540
I'll see you guys inside.

171
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,080
What's happening, buddy?

172
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,840
Yes.

173
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,040
Good morning, Hank.
I'm midway through the G's.

174
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,080
Hey, who's the girl in...?

175
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,670
Never mind.
Hey, I'll see you in the morning.

176
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,210
What am I supposed to say?

177
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,540
"Hello.

178
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,290
Wanna see some infected rats?"

179
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,290
Okay, tomorrow.
I'm gonna say hello tomorrow.

180
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,160
Psst.

181
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,370
Come here. Hey. Hey.

182
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,630
Good job. You did so good.

183
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,580
Yes. Yes.

184
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,920
Ah.

185
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,250
Look at that. See that? Red salmon.

186
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,670
Wow, actual Spam. Yeah.

187
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,880
You'll get some of that Iater.

188
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,580
Let's go.

189
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,920
Wait.

190
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,710
My name is Robert Neville.

191
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,540
I am a survivor living in New York City.

192
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,330
I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.

193
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,920
I will be at the South Street Seaport
every day at midday...

194
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,160
...when the sun is highest in the sky.

195
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,120
If you are out there....

196
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,960
If anyone is out there....

197
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,370
I can provide food.

198
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,290
I can provide shelter.

199
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,250
I can provide security.

200
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,880
If there's anybody out there...

201
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,790
...anybody....

202
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,120
Please.

203
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,040
You are not alone.

204
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,370
Fore!

205
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,960
Yeah.

206
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,460
Keep your eye on this one for me.

207
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,000
Ooh.

208
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,580
I'm getting good.

209
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,630
Ss-ss.

210
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,040
Sam! No, no, no!

211
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,580
No! No! Sam!

212
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,500
No! No!

213
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:39,000
Sam? Sam? Sam?

214
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,750
Sam? Sam?

215
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,120
Sam? Sam?

216
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,420
Hello, Sam?

217
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,120
Sam?

218
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,080
Sam?

219
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,880
Come on. Sam.

220
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,370
I gotta go, Sam.

221
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,670
I gotta go. I gotta go.

222
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,250
Sam?

223
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,790
Sam? Sam?

224
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,500
Sam? Sam?

225
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,580
Sam. Sam.

226
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,370
Sam. Sam, come on, we gotta go.
Sam.

227
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,920
What are you doing?

228
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,250
Sam, we gotta go!

229
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,040
Sam, go! Go!

230
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,540
Sam, get out! Get out!

231
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:23,330
You gotta pay attention, okay?
You gotta pay attention.

232
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,160
Listen, uh...

233
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,250
... I want you to stay here
on this one, okay?

234
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,370
Because you can still get infected.

235
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,000
And I can't.

236
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,000
So, look, if I'm not back by dark...

237
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,080
...just go.

238
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:38,630
Okay. Subject is female.
Likely 18 to 20 years of age.

239
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,120
Dilaudid push only sedates effectively
at six times human dose.

240
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:47,160
Core temperature, 106 Fahrenheit.
Pulse, 200 bpm.

241
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,500
Respiration elevated.

242
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,500
PA O2, 300 percent of normal.

243
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,330
Pupils fully dilated.

244
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,840
Nonreactive to light.

245
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,210
Extreme reaction to UV exposure.

246
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:42,040
Symptoms and tissue samples
confirm subject is infected with KV.

247
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,040
Vaccine test.

248
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,500
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6.

249
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,790
Commencing human trials.

250
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,750
Respiration slowing.

251
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,920
Pulse, 190. Core temperature...

252
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,630
... 105...

253
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,290
... 104 and decreasing.

254
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,370
We may have something here.

255
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,960
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6
ineffective on humans.

256
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:48,330
Test results linked to this entry
saved on six redundant drives.

257
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Still no cure.

258
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,880
Day 1001.

259
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,160
We came in close contact
with a hive today.

260
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,120
Blood tests confirm that
I remain immune to both the airborne...

261
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,040
...and contact strains.

262
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:25,080
Canines remain immune
to airborne strain only.

263
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,420
You can't go running
into the dark, dummy.

264
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,210
Vaccine trials continue.

265
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:38,460
I'm still unable to transfer my immunity
to infected hosts.

266
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,880
The Krippin Virus is...

267
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
...elegant.

268
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,210
Just fishing in the dark, son.

269
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,120
Mm. A behavioral note, um:

270
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,630
An infected male
exposed himself to sunlight today.

271
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,580
Now, it's possible
decreased brain function...

272
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:14,880
...or the growing scarcity of food
is causing them to...

273
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,960
...ignore their basic survival instincts.

274
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,330
Social de-evolution appears complete.

275
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,750
Typical human behavior
is now entirely absent.

276
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,160
Why are we stopping?

277
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,670
The street's closed, folks. We hoof it.

278
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,120
-We got less than 10 minutes.
-Baby, give me the dog.

279
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,710
-Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go.
Daddy!

280
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,210
It's all right. It's all right. Come on.

281
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:02,040
Keep the colonel and his family
between us and don't let anyone stop you.

282
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,630
Mommy, they have guns!

283
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,790
It's okay. They're in the Army like Daddy.

284
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,040
Unless you have clearance...

285
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,630
...you cannot pass the checkpoint.
Please return to your homes.

286
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,160
Make a hole, make a hole!
Coming through!

287
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,840
Coming through!

288
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,840
Unless you have clearance,
you cannot pass the checkpoint.

289
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,040
Please return to your homes.

290
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,120
You're clear. Move ahead.

291
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,580
You're clear.

292
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,330
All right, that's it, move up.

293
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,880
All right, step up.

294
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,630
You're clear. Next. Let's go.

295
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,290
No good.

296
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,500
Military quarantine is about to begin.

297
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,580
Come on, step back.

298
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,580
-Military quarantine is about to begin.
-Look, look, look.

299
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,710
I'm not infected.
Clear. Good, go on.

300
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm not infected.

301
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,580
Please! Please!

302
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,500
-Please take my baby. Take my baby, please.
You're gonna have to move back.

303
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,040
-No good.
Follow me, ma'am.

304
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,580
What? No! Robert! Robert!

305
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,920
Get your hands off my wife.
Get your hands off.

306
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,460
-Mommy!
Stand down.

307
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,670
Lieutenant--

308
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,500
-Mommy!
-Scan her again. Get your hands off of her!

309
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,120
Get your hands off of my wife.

310
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,630
Stand down!
-Scan her again. Stand down!

311
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,420
Stand down, soldier! Stand down!

312
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,160
I am Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville.
I am ordering you to scan her again.

313
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,040
Scan her again!

314
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,630
All right, scan her again.

315
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:18,420
-It's clear.
-It's clear. Move through.

316
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,960
Who's next? Come on.

317
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,080
Take my baby with you!
Please! Please!

318
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,460
-Mommy!
-Please take my baby. Please!

319
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,630
Daddy, why can't the little girl come too?

320
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,370
Stay away from the shoreline.

321
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,210
How long?

322
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,630
Five minutes. We'll make it.

323
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,960
This is Ranger 621, we're on site.

324
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:47,710
Military quarantine is about to begin.

325
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:04,790
I won't take my eyes off them, colonel.
You got my word on it.

326
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,330
Give me a kiss.

327
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,460
I love you. I love you.

328
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,000
Dear Lord, please watch over Robert...

329
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,500
...and keep him strong
through the struggles ahead.

330
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,710
Lord, please just bring him home safely.
Amen.

331
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,710
Daddy's gonna make the monsters
go away, baby, okay?

332
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,160
Sam, you protect Daddy.

333
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:45,330
-No, baby, I can't. Daddy can't take a dog.
Sir, we gotta go!

334
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,460
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

335
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,370
It's a butterfly.

336
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,920
All right, come on, let's go!

337
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,670
How'd you sleep?

338
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,960
Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look
at the ongoing mutations...

339
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:55,040
...of Dr. Alice Krippin's once-hailed
miracle cure for cancer.

340
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:59,330
So far, almost 5000 patients
treated with her retrofitted virus...

341
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,330
...have begun exhibiting symptoms
resembling the early onset of rabies.

342
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,290
Twenty-five patients have already died.

343
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,670
Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals
to stockpile antiviral drugs...

344
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,790
...and to begin
preliminary quarantine protocols.

345
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,540
It's my birthday.

346
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:19,080
We are fully confident Dr. Neville
can see us through these--

347
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,960
You gonna sing?

348
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,290
My name is Robert Neville.

349
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,040
I am a survivor living in New York City.

350
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,790
I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.

351
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:38,040
I will be at the South Street Seaport
every day at midday...

352
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,040
...when the sun is highest in the sky.

353
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:47,290
If you are out there,
if anyone is out there....

354
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,630
I can provide food. I can provide shelter.

355
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,580
I can provide security.

356
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,250
If there's anybody out there, anybody....

357
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,370
Please.

358
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
You are not alone.

359
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,580
Listen, uh...

360
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:11,120
...if you're planning a party or something,
just tell me now.

361
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,160
Okay? Because you know
I don't like surprises.

362
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:17,960
And I swear I'll act surprised. Okay?

363
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,710
Hey! Hey!

364
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,920
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

365
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,630
What the--? What the hell are you--?
No!

366
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,500
No! No!

367
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,080
No.

368
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:21,080
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

369
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,750
How did you get out here?!

370
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,080
Fred, if you're real,
you better tell me right now!

371
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:30,670
If you're real,
you better tell me right now!

372
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,750
Damn it, Fred!

373
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,290
Damn it!

374
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:52,210
I'm all right. I'm all right, I'm all right.

375
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,920
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

376
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,920
Baby. I'm okay.

377
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,000
I'm okay. I'm okay.

378
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,370
Let's go.

379
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,500
Eh, eh! Come on. Sam, come on.

380
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,040
Let's go! Sam!

381
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,040
No! No! Let's go!

382
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:43,960
We gotta go home, Sam. Let's go!

383
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,210
Sam!

384
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,460
No!

385
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,580
Sam? Sam?

386
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:52,710
It's okay.

387
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,960
You're all right. Okay. It's okay.

388
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,630
You're all right. You're all right.

389
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,750
Samantha? Samantha, Iook at me, girl.

390
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,120
Hey. You're okay.
You're okay. Samantha.

391
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:09,460
We just gotta get you home.
Gotta get you-- Gotta take you home.

392
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:12,210
Let me take you home.
All right, come here.

393
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:14,880
Come here. Come here. Come here.

394
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,330
Come on. Come here. Come here.

395
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,920
I got you. I got you.

396
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,710
It's okay.

397
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,330
You're okay.

398
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:15,120
Don't worry

399
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,460
About a thing

400
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:25,670
'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be all right

401
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:34,750
Don't worry
About a thing

402
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,040
Rise up this morning

403
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:46,250
Smiled with the rising sun

404
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,580
Three little birds

405
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:00,250
I promised my friend...

406
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:07,080
...that I would say hello to you today.

407
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,460
Hello.

408
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:22,920
Hello.

409
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:36,160
Please say hello to me.

410
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,790
Please say hello to me.

411
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,880
Die!

412
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,250
Die!

413
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:25,040
Die!

414
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,330
Come on! Stay with me!

415
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:12,460
Where do you live?

416
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,210
Hey.

417
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:18,210
Hey!

418
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:20,500
Stay with me.

419
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:23,670
Where do you live?

420
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:29,160
Where do you live?

421
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,160
Uh....

422
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:35,540
11 Washington Square.

423
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,790
They don't know where I live.

424
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:43,160
Don't-- Don't let them track us.

425
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:46,120
You gotta stay out till dawn.

426
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
No!

427
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,500
Donkey?

428
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:56,580
What are you doing?

429
01:04:56,750 --> 01:05:00,080
I would think of all people you would
recognize a wall when you see one.

430
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:05,000
Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go
around my swamp, not through it.

431
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,120
It is. Around your half, see?
That's your half, this is my half.

432
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:11,880
Oh, your half? Hm.
Yes, my half.

433
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:15,670
I helped rescue the princess. I did
half the work. I get half the booty.

434
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:19,210
Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head.

435
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:21,540
Back off!
No, you back off.

436
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:23,790
This is my swamp!
Our swamp.

437
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:29,420
-Smelly ogre.
Fine!

438
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,840
Come back,
I'm not through with you!

439
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,500
Well, I'm through with you.

440
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:36,790
You know, with you
it's always "me, me, me."

441
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:42,000
Well, guess what, now it's my turn.
So you just shut up and pay attention!

442
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,330
You are mean to me! You insult me and
you don't appreciate anything that I do.

443
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,920
You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.

444
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:53,460
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?

445
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:56,790
Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!

446
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,840
Oh, yeah.

447
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,330
You're right, Donkey. I forgive you...

448
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,040
...for stabbing me in the back!

449
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:09,880
You're so wrapped up in layers,
you're afraid of your own feelings.

450
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,210
Go away.
See?

451
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:13,540
Doing it again,
just like you did to Fiona...

452
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:15,880
...and all she did was like you,
maybe love you.

453
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:20,540
Love me? She said I was ugly,
a hideous creature.

454
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,330
I heard the two of you talking.

455
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:27,330
She wasn't talking about you,
she was talking about somebody else.

456
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:38,840
I'm afraid the eggs are powdered.

457
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,040
Obviously you know that.

458
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,080
They're yours.

459
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:48,290
But I did find bacon, which is about
the most fantastic thing in history.

460
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:52,250
And some antibiotics in the bathroom.

461
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:54,790
I put by your plate,
because your leg is okay...

462
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,160
...but it won't be for very long
if you don't start a course soon.

463
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,250
Who are you?

464
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:06,290
I'm Anna and that's Ethan.

465
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:15,500
Don't let it get cold.

466
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:31,210
It's okay. Go on.

467
01:07:56,330 --> 01:08:00,460
We came from Maryland.
We heard your message on the radio.

468
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,210
We were at the pier at noon.
We waited all day.

469
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,670
We're going to Vermont.

470
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:12,000
To the survivors' colony.

471
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:14,160
What?

472
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,750
In Bethel. It's a safe zone.

473
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,370
There's no survivors' colony,
there's no safe zones.

474
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:23,420
Nothing happened
the way it was supposed to.

475
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,670
Nothing worked
the way it was supposed to.

476
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:30,420
In the mountains. There's a whole colony
of people there who didn't get sick.

477
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:33,120
The virus couldn't survive the cold.
There's a colony--

478
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:35,500
Shut up! Shut up!

479
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:37,120
Everybody's dead.

480
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:39,420
Everybody is dead.

481
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:50,500
I just need--
I need a minute. Okay?

482
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,630
Just....

483
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:00,420
I just-- I was saving that bacon.

484
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,290
I was saving it.

485
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,580
I'm just-- I'm gonna go upstairs.
All right? Just--

486
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,790
I'm gonna go.

487
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,580
Ethan, put the knife down.

488
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:10,460
You there! Ogre.
Aye.

489
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:12,840
By the order of Lord Farquaad...

490
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,420
... I am authorized
to place you both under arrest...

491
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:21,370
...and transport you
to a designated resettlement facility.

492
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:25,920
Oh, really? You and what army?

493
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,840
Can I say something to you?

494
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
You was really, really something
back there. Incredible.

495
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:44,370
Are you talking to...

496
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,540
...me?

497
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,210
Yes, I was talking to you.
You was really great back there.

498
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:54,670
Those guards, they thought they was
all that. You showed up, and bam!

499
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,080
Tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.

500
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:59,290
That really made me
feel good to see that.

501
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,670
That's great. Really.
Man, it's good to be free.

502
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:05,960
Now, why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own friends?

503
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,630
Hm?

504
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:09,210
But, uh...

505
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:11,000
... I don't have any friends.

506
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,670
And I'm not going out there by myself.

507
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,460
Wait a minute. I got a great idea.
I'll stick with you!

508
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:18,370
You a mean, green fighting machine.

509
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,670
Together we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.

510
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,160
I like Shrek.

511
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:28,750
That was really scary.
If you don't mind me saying...

512
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,670
...if that don't work, your breath
will get the job done...

513
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,750
...because you definitely need some
tic tacs, because your breath stinks!

514
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:40,420
Man, you almost burned the hair
out of my nose. Just like the time....

515
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,540
You're not so good with people anymore,
are you?

516
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,500
Thank you for my leg.

517
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,750
Okay.

518
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,370
Where have you been?

519
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:06,160
I was on a Red Cross evacuation ship
out of São Paulo.

520
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:09,420
Those boats
weren't meant to be permanent.

521
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,160
No, they weren't.

522
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:14,330
When the Navy fell apart,
we started docking to take on supplies.

523
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:18,290
Someone picked it up on shore.
Five of us were immune.

524
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,120
You said five?

525
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:23,160
The Darkseekers got them.

526
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:28,160
You are the Robert Neville, aren't you?

527
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,370
It's too late today.

528
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:41,670
If we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can
make it to Vermont in a straight shot.

529
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,290
-So if you had--
-I'm not leaving.

530
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,500
This is ground zero.

531
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,080
This is my site.

532
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:55,250
I'm not gonna let this happen.

533
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:59,750
I can still fix this.

534
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,500
What happened to your leg?

535
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,120
That's my snare.
These are my materials.

536
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:16,290
The infected didn't do this. They can't.

537
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,120
-How do you know?
-They have no higher brain function.

538
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:25,580
They don't plan or hate.
They don't love. They can't.

539
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:31,790
Could they be evolving?

540
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,040
Ethan.

541
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,790
Hey, Ethan.

542
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,330
It's cold.

543
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,120
We gotta go.

544
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:09,840
I've been cooking the compounds.
What?

545
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,420
Ice. I need ice.

546
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,580
Whoa. You scared me.
-Sorry.

547
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,080
I called down twice.

548
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,920
Oh. Oh, thank you.

549
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:38,210
It's heavily sedated.
Don't worry, it's safe.

550
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:41,080
I've never seen one so still.

551
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:44,370
They're always biting.

552
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:50,710
You think that can cure her?

553
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,840
Um.... No, this will
almost certainly kill it...

554
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,210
...but it's possible by drastically reducing
the body temperature...

555
01:14:57,370 --> 01:15:00,370
... I can increase the compound's
effectiveness.

556
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:14,000
Did all of them die?

557
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,790
Yes.

558
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,880
My God.

559
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:25,420
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.

560
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:33,080
Where can Ethan sleep?

561
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:53,670
He's heavy.

562
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,960
Can you get that?

563
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:36,080
She's beautiful.

564
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:38,460
What's her name?

565
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,040
Marley.

566
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:46,880
-Her name was Marley.
-It's a beautiful name.

567
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:52,840
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.

568
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,330
-Who?
-Uh, the singer.

569
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:59,080
Damian?

570
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:02,370
Uh, his father.

571
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:07,920
His father.

572
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,160
Nope.

573
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:12,420
I shot the sheriff

574
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:18,710
But I didn't shoot the deputy

575
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:31,210
-Oh, that is unacceptable.
-What?

576
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:38,370
Best album ever made.

577
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:50,750
-You don't recognize that?
-Mm-mm.

578
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,330
Wow.

579
01:17:55,500 --> 01:18:01,080
He had this idea,
it was kind of a virologist's idea.

580
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:05,880
He believed that you could cure
racism and hate. Literally cure it...

581
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:12,160
...by injecting music and love
into people's lives.

582
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,880
One day, he was scheduled
to perform at a peace rally.

583
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:21,000
Gunmen came to his house
and shot him down.

584
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,160
Two days later...

585
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:28,420
...he walked out on that stage and sang.

586
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:32,630
Somebody asked him why.

587
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,960
He said, "The people...

588
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:42,160
...who are trying to make this world worse
are not taking a day off.

589
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:45,330
How can I?"

590
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:51,250
Light up the darkness.

591
01:19:17,290 --> 01:19:19,500
Come with us, Neville.

592
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,120
To the colony.

593
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,250
There's no colony, Anna.

594
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:34,080
Everything just fell apart.

595
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:37,960
-There was no evacuation plan--
-You're wrong. There is a colony.

596
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,540
I know, okay?

597
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,210
How do you know, Anna?

598
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:50,790
I just know.

599
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:57,210
How? I said, how do you know?
How could you know?

600
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,250
God told me.

601
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:02,750
He has a plan.

602
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,080
-God told you?
-Yes.

603
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:10,000
-The God?
-Yes.

604
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:14,000
-I know how this sounds.
-It sounds crazy.

605
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:17,960
But something told me
to turn on the radio.

606
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,750
Something told me to come here.

607
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,710
My voice on the radio
told you to come here, Anna.

608
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,920
You were trying to kill yourself
last night?

609
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,080
Anna.

610
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:29,420
I got here just in time to save your life.
That's a coincidence?

611
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:33,210
-Just stop it. Stop it. Stop.
-He must have sent me here for a reason.

612
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:37,420
Neville, the world is quieter now.

613
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,710
You just have to listen.

614
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,040
If we listen...

615
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:44,670
...we can hear God's plan.

616
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,920
-God's plan?
-Yeah.

617
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,630
All right. Let me tell you
about your God's plan.

618
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:52,710
There were 6 billion people on Earth
when the infection hit.

619
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:57,460
KV had a 90 percent kill rate.
That's 5.4 billion...

620
01:20:57,630 --> 01:21:00,080
...people dead.

621
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:03,080
Crashed and bled out, dead.

622
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:05,120
Less than 1 percent immunity.

623
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:09,080
That left 12 million healthy people
like you, me and Ethan.

624
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:13,420
The other 588 million...

625
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:15,580
...turned into your Darkseekers.

626
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:17,420
And then they got hungry.

627
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:22,040
And they killed and fed on everybody.

628
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,290
Everybody!

629
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,960
Every single person
that you or I has ever known...

630
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,080
...is dead!

631
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:37,290
Dead!

632
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:41,370
There is no God. There is no God.

633
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:48,500
What is that?

634
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,160
Was it still dark when you
brought us home last night?

635
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:58,460
You were bleeding.
There was light on the horizon.

636
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,790
Turn the light off. Turn it off.

637
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,500
They followed us home.

638
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:13,330
Ethan.

639
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,160
Shit.

640
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,500
Anna.

641
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,840
Anna.

642
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:25,250
Anna!

643
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,790
Anna!

644
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:43,790
Anna!

645
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,880
Anna?

646
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,580
Anna.

647
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:37,630
Come on. Come on.

648
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:40,630
-Are you okay? You all right?
Yeah.

649
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:42,330
Are you all right?

650
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,080
-You okay?
-Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

651
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:01,370
Go to the lab. Downstairs, go!

652
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:04,460
Get to the lab! To the lab!

653
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:14,790
Get behind the Plexi.

654
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:17,290
Oh, my God. Come on.

655
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,630
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

656
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:35,250
Oh, my God.

657
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:49,710
It's working.

658
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,420
Neville...

659
01:27:56,710 --> 01:27:58,500
...it's working.

660
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,630
No! Stop! Stop!

661
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,210
Look, look, look, I can save you.

662
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:12,840
I can sa-- I can help you.
You are sick and I can help you.

663
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,960
I can-- I can fix this!

664
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,670
I can save everybody!

665
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:23,040
I can fix everything! It's working.
It's working!

666
01:28:26,290 --> 01:28:27,710
Stop! Stop!

667
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:37,290
Let me save you! Let me save you!

668
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:38,460
No, no!

No, no!

670
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,790
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

671
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:02,790
Robert.

672
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:05,960
What are you doing?

673
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,290
Open the door, please.

674
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:38,790
What are you doing?

675
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:42,460
I'm listening.

676
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,120
Shh, shh, shh....

677
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:10,120
Don't Iook.

678
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,670
I need to get a syringe.

679
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:19,670
I'm sorry.

680
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,000
Shh, shh, shh....

681
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,670
My name is Anna Montez.

682
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:45,210
There are other survivors.

683
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:51,580
I am traveling with Dr. Robert Neville
and a boy named Ethan.

684
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:56,630
We're heading north on Route 17
to Bethel, Vermont.

685
01:34:56,790 --> 01:35:01,880
Keep your radio on.
Listen for our broadcasts.

686
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:04,920
You are not alone.

687
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:08,080
There is hope.

688
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:11,460
Keep listening.

689
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:14,670
You are not alone.
