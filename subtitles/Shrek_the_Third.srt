1
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,695
Onward, Ohauncey!

2
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:02,429
To the highest room
of the tallest tower...

3
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:07,668
...where my princess awaits rescue
from her handsome Prince Oharming!

4
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:22,787
This is worse than "Love Leters".
I hate dinner theater!

5
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:24,688
Me, too.

6
00:01:26,028 --> 00:01:28,019
Whoa there, Ohauncey!

7
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,889
Hark! The brave Prince Oharming
approacheth.

8
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:37,404
Fear not, fair maiden. I shall slay
the monster that guards you...

9
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,475
...then take my place as rightful king.

10
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:42,201
What did she say?

11
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,380
It's Shrek!

12
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,311
Whoo, Shrek, yeah!

13
00:01:51,554 --> 00:01:53,647
Prepare, foul beast...

14
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:58,453
...to enter into a world of pain
with which you are not familiar!

15
00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:01,154
Happy birthday to thee
Happy birthday to thee

16
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:02,559
Do you mind?

17
00:02:02,898 --> 00:02:06,061
Do you mind? Boring!

18
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:12,905
Prepare, foul beast...

19
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:24,613
Someday you'll be sorry.

20
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:26,914
We already are!

21
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,344
Mommy...

22
00:02:57,286 --> 00:03:00,778
You're right. I can't let this happen.

23
00:03:01,624 --> 00:03:02,955
I can't!

24
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:07,892
I am the rightful King of Far Far Away.

25
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,123
And I promise you this, Mother...

26
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:13,196
...I will restore dignity to my throne.

27
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:18,898
And this time,

28
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:23,205
no one will stand in my way.

29
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:41,823
Good morning.

30
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,492
Good morning.

31
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:47,192
Morning breath.

32
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:50,499
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

33
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:53,004
Good morning, good morning

34
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:56,076
The sun is shining through

35
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:58,406
Good morning, good morning
To you

36
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:00,674
And you!
And you!

37
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:06,281
They grow up so fast.

38
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:08,515
Not fast enough.

39
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:13,288
You'll be filling in
for the King and Queen.

40
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:16,626
Several functions
require your atendance, sir.

41
00:04:16,765 --> 00:04:20,064
Great! Let's get started.

42
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:23,035
Oome on, lazybones. Time to get moving!

43
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:26,136
You need to get a pair ofjammies.

44
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:36,813
I got some sleep and I needed it

45
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:39,682
Not a lot, just a little bit

46
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:42,916
Someone's always
trying to keep me from it

47
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:45,891
It's a crying shame

48
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:48,928
It's a royal pain in the neck

49
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:50,725
I knight thee.

50
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:15,716
If you're filling in for a king,
you should look like one.

51
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,918
Oan somebody come in
and work on Shrek?

52
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:22,253
I will see what I can do.

53
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:45,113
Yeah, wow.

54
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:48,445
Is this really necessary?

55
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,885
Quite necessary, Fiona.

56
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:53,824
- I'm Shrek, you twit.
- Whatever.

57
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:57,659
This isn't a rehearsal, peoples.
Let's see some hustle!

58
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,734
Smiles, everyone! Smiles!

59
00:05:59,868 --> 00:06:03,326
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

60
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:06,407
I'm sorry, but can you
just try to grin and bear it?

61
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:08,567
It's just until Dad gets beter.

62
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:11,977
Shrek?

63
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:14,907
You look handsome.

64
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,984
Oome here, you.

65
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:35,997
My but is itching up a storm and
I can't reach it in this monkey suit.

66
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,774
Hey, you! Oome here. What's your name?

67
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:42,274
Fiddlesworth, sir.

68
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:43,503
Perfect.

69
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:48,547
Ladies and gentlemen...

70
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:51,847
...Princess Fiona and Sir Shrek!

71
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:57,954
Ahh! You've got it.

72
00:06:58,093 --> 00:06:59,617
A litle to the left.

73
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,058
That's it! That's good.

74
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:06,292
Oh, yeah! Scratch
that thing! You're on it.

75
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:07,868
Shrek!

76
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:13,900
My eye!

77
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:15,202
What are you doing?

78
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:22,772
Fiona!

79
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:29,119
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

80
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:35,060
Shrimp! My favorite!

81
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:48,270
- That's it! We're leaving!
- Oalm down.

82
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,347
Oalm down? Who do you think
we're kidding? I am an ogre.

83
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:57,077
I'm not cut out for this, Fiona,
and I never will be.

84
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:02,521
I think that went well.

85
00:08:02,658 --> 00:08:03,886
Donkey!

86
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,755
Oome on, Shrek!

87
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:09,492
Some people just don't
understand boundaries.

88
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:23,370
Just think. A couple more days
and we'll be back home...

89
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:26,811
...in our vermin-filled shack
strewn with fungus...

90
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:29,850
...and filled with the stench
of mud and neglect.

91
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:32,613
You had me at "vermin-filled".

92
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:38,290
And, um... maybe even the piter-pater
of litle feet on the floor.

93
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:41,490
That's right, the swamp rats
will be spawning.

94
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,995
Uh, no.

95
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:46,828
What I'm thinking of is a litle bigger
than a swamp rat.

96
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:47,993
Donkey?

97
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:51,799
No, Shrek. What if, theoretically...

98
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,202
...they were litle ogre feet?

99
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,017
Honey, let's be rational about this.

100
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:07,519
Have you seen a baby lately?

101
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:10,853
They just eat and poop, and they cry...

102
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:14,360
...then they cry when they poop
and poop when they cry.

103
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:17,294
Now, imagine an ogre baby.

104
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,232
They extra-cry and they extra-poop.

105
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,965
Shrek, don't you ever think
about having a family?

106
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:28,668
Right now, you're my family.

107
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:34,842
Somebody beter be dying.

108
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,015
I'm dying.

109
00:09:41,356 --> 00:09:42,516
Harold?

110
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:47,787
Don't forget
to pay the gardener, Lillian.

111
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:49,863
Of course, darling.

112
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,658
Fiona.

113
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,325
Yes, Daddy?

114
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,199
I know I made many mistakes with you.

115
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,673
It's okay.

116
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,935
But your love for Shrek has...

117
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:04,277
...taught me much.

118
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:08,406
My dear boy...

119
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,815
...I am proud to call you my son.

120
00:10:11,953 --> 00:10:15,081
And I'm proud to call you my frog...

121
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:17,657
...King dad-in-law.

122
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:23,390
Now there is a mater
of business to atend to.

123
00:10:33,742 --> 00:10:36,734
The Frog King... is dead.

124
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,888
Put your hat back on, fool.

125
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,614
Shrek...

126
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:50,418
...please come hither.

127
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:55,627
Yeah, Dad?

128
00:10:55,764 --> 00:10:58,927
This kingdom needs a new king.

129
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:04,932
You and Fiona
are next in line for the throne.

130
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:10,806
Next in line. You see, Dad,
that's why people love you.

131
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:14,279
Even on your deathbed,
you're still making jokes.

132
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:21,650
Oome on, Dad. An ogre as king?

133
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,315
That's not such a good idea.

134
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:27,758
There must be somebody else. Anybody!

135
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:33,095
Aside from you, there is
only one remaining heir.

136
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:36,432
Really? Who is he, Dad?

137
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,630
His name is...

138
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:41,066
...is...

139
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:42,836
What's his name?

140
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:44,570
...is...

141
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:47,573
Daddy!

142
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,801
His name is Arthur.

143
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,334
Arthur?

144
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:15,871
I know you'll do...

145
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:18,673
...what's right.

146
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:23,047
Harold?

147
00:12:23,185 --> 00:12:24,743
Dad? Dad!

148
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:27,416
Dad?

149
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:29,615
Do your thing, man.

150
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:03,422
When you were young and your heart

151
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:05,719
Was an open book

152
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:11,859
You used to say live and let live

153
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,333
You know you did, you know you did
You know you did

154
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:21,200
But if this ever changing world
In which we live in

155
00:13:22,077 --> 00:13:26,241
Makes you give in and cry

156
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,911
Say live and let die

157
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,017
Live and let die

158
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:16,293
Hey, lady
You, lady

159
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:19,460
Cursing at your life

160
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:22,797
You're a discontented mother

161
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:27,134
And a regimented wife

162
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:55,997
What does a prince
have to do to get a drink here?

163
00:14:57,339 --> 00:14:59,034
Ah, Mabel!

164
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:03,577
Why they call you an ugly stepsister,
I'll never know.

165
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:07,773
Where's Doris? Taking the night off?

166
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,682
She's not welcome here,
and neither are you.

167
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:15,380
What do you want, Oharming?

168
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:19,584
Not much. Just a chance at redemption.

169
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:22,663
And a Fuzzy Navel.

170
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,857
And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends!

171
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,932
We're not your friends.

172
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,269
You don't belong here.

173
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:40,575
You're absolutely right,
but, I mean, do any of us?

174
00:15:40,715 --> 00:15:42,342
Do a number on his face.

175
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:47,080
Wait, wait, wait!
We are more alike than you think.

176
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:51,124
Wicked Witch! The Seven Dwarfs
saved Snow White, and what happened?

177
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:52,351
Oh, what's it to you?

178
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,758
They left you the unfairest of them all.

179
00:15:54,896 --> 00:15:59,424
Now here you are,
hustling pool to get your next meal.

180
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,398
How does that feel?

181
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,467
Prety unfair.

182
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,009
And you!

183
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:14,775
Your star puppet abandons the show
to go and find his father.

184
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:18,377
I hate that litle wooden puppet.

185
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,488
And Hook.

186
00:16:20,622 --> 00:16:22,214
Need I say more?

187
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:28,691
- And you, Frumpypigskin!
- Rumpelstiltskin.

188
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,458
Where's that firstborn
you were promised?

189
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,770
Mabel. Remember how you
couldn't get your litle fat foot...

190
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:39,806
...into that tiny glass slipper?

191
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:46,004
Oinderella is
in Far Far Away right now...

192
00:16:46,147 --> 00:16:51,175
...eating bonbons, cavorting with
every last fairy tale creature...

193
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:53,787
...that has ever done you wrong!

194
00:16:53,922 --> 00:16:58,859
Once upon a time, someone decided
that we were the losers.

195
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:01,860
But there are
two sides to every story...

196
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,555
...and our side has not been told!

197
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:09,568
So who will join me? Who wants
to come out on top for once?

198
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:11,365
Who wants their...

199
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:14,669
..."happily ever after"?

200
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,521
This way, gents.

201
00:17:44,873 --> 00:17:49,901
It's out of my hands, senorita. The
winds of fate have blown on my destiny.

202
00:17:50,044 --> 00:17:53,844
But I will never forget you.
You are the love of my life.

203
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:56,416
As are you.

204
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:58,917
And, uh, you.

205
00:17:59,053 --> 00:18:02,216
I don't know you, but I'd like to.

206
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,722
I got to go!

207
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,822
I don't wanna leave you either.

208
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,795
But you know how Shrek is.
The dude's lost without me.

209
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:15,066
But don't worry. I'll send you
airmail kisses every day!

210
00:18:16,404 --> 00:18:17,769
Be strong, babies.

211
00:18:17,906 --> 00:18:20,340
Ooco, Peanut, listen to your mama.

212
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:24,468
Bananas, no roasting marshmallows
on your sister's head.

213
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,108
That's my special boy!

214
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:31,343
Oome here, all of you!
Give your daddy a big hug!

215
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:39,257
Shrek?

216
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:44,561
Maybe you should just stay and be King.

217
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:48,226
Oome on. There's no way
I could run a kingdom.

218
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:51,361
That's why your cousin Arthur
is a perfect choice.

219
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:54,031
It's not that. You see...

220
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:58,635
And if he gives me trouble,
I always have persuasion and reason.

221
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,113
Here's persuasion... and here's reason.

222
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,918
Fiona...

223
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:09,319
...soon it's just going to be you, me...

224
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:11,118
...and our swamp.

225
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:15,452
It's not going to be just you and me.

226
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:18,631
All aboard!

227
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:22,634
It will be. I promise.

228
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:25,295
I love you.

229
00:19:31,913 --> 00:19:33,574
That's lovely.

230
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,307
Bye-bye, babies!

231
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,084
Shrek!

232
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:47,521
- Wait!
- What is it?

233
00:19:47,662 --> 00:19:49,152
I'm... I'm...

234
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:55,032
I love you, too, honey!

235
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:58,002
No! I said I'm...

236
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:02,442
You're what?

237
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:05,011
I said I'm pregnant!

238
00:20:09,183 --> 00:20:10,650
What was that?

239
00:20:10,785 --> 00:20:13,845
You're going to be a father!

240
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,487
That's great!

241
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,890
Really? I'm glad you think so!

242
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:22,428
I love you!

243
00:20:22,563 --> 00:20:24,554
Yeah!

244
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:27,031
Me, too! You!

245
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:34,397
I'm going to be an uncle!
I'm going to be an uncle!

246
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:37,602
And you, my friend, are royally...

247
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,306
Home.

248
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:30,928
Shrek!

249
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:34,598
Fiona!

250
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:39,937
Fiona?

251
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,559
Oh, no.

252
00:22:03,731 --> 00:22:06,632
Beter out than in, I always say.

253
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,641
No, no, no!

254
00:22:19,814 --> 00:22:22,374
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.

255
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:29,816
Stop! Hey, wait!

256
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:20,731
Donkey. Donkey!

257
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,103
Wake up!

258
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:25,876
Dada!

259
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:30,307
Shrek! Are you okay?

260
00:23:32,053 --> 00:23:37,582
I can't believe I'm going to be
a father. How did this happen?

261
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:41,923
Allow me to explain. When a man
has feelings for a woman...

262
00:23:42,063 --> 00:23:44,588
...a powerful urge sweeps over him.

263
00:23:44,732 --> 00:23:47,223
I know how it happened.

264
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:50,128
I just can't believe it.

265
00:23:52,907 --> 00:23:54,738
How does it happen?

266
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:07,016
And the cat's in the cradle
and the silver spoon

267
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,782
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon

268
00:24:09,924 --> 00:24:12,518
When you coming home, son?
I don't know when

269
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,958
But we'll get together then, Dad.

270
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:17,087
Donkey! Oan you just cut to the part

271
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:19,756
where you're supposed
to make me feel beter?

272
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,026
You know I love Fiona, boss. Right?

273
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,231
What I am talking about
is you, me, my cousin's boat...

274
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:32,972
...an ice cold pitcher of mojitos
and two weeks of nothing but fishing.

275
00:24:33,114 --> 00:24:34,979
Don't listen to him!

276
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:37,812
Having a baby
isn't going to ruin your life.

277
00:24:37,952 --> 00:24:42,480
It's not my life I'm worried
about ruining, it's the kid's.

278
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:46,923
When have you ever heard the phrase
as sweet as an ogre...

279
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:49,495
...or "as nurturing as an ogre"...

280
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,999
...or "You'll love
my dad. He's a real ogre."

281
00:24:54,135 --> 00:24:55,898
Okay. I get it.

282
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:59,495
It's not going to be easy.
But you got us to help you.

283
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,335
That's true.

284
00:25:01,475 --> 00:25:02,942
I'm doomed.

285
00:25:03,077 --> 00:25:04,738
You'll be fine.

286
00:25:05,646 --> 00:25:07,546
You're finished.

287
00:25:09,817 --> 00:25:12,479
Uh, with yourjourney.

288
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:25,098
Wor-ces-ters-shiree?
Now that sounds fancy!

289
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,563
It's Worcestershire.

290
00:25:26,701 --> 00:25:28,532
Like the sauce?

291
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:30,000
It's spicy!

292
00:25:33,841 --> 00:25:35,672
They must be expecting us.

293
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,380
What in the shista-shire
kind of place is this?

294
00:25:44,518 --> 00:25:49,717
Well, my stomach aches and my palms
just got sweaty. Must be a high school.

295
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:51,017
High school?

296
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:52,716
Ready? Okay!

297
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,294
Wherefore art thou headed, to the top?

298
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:59,388
Yeah, we think so, we think so! And
dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped?

299
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:02,001
Nay, we thinkst not, we thinkst not!

300
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:11,267
All right, Mr. Percival,
ease up on the reins.

301
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:18,312
For lo, bro, don't burn
all my frankincense and myrrh.

302
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:21,944
I'm feeling nauseous from memories
of wedgies and swirlies!

303
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:26,753
How did you receive wedgies when you are
clearly not the wearer of underpants?

304
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:29,795
Let's just say some things
are beter left unsaid.

305
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,991
So I was all like, "I'd rather get
the black plague than go out with you."

306
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:36,467
- Oh, totally.
- Pardon me.

307
00:26:36,604 --> 00:26:39,402
- Totally ew-eth.
- Yeah, totally.

308
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:43,602
I just altered my character level
to +3 superb-ability.

309
00:26:43,744 --> 00:26:46,304
Hi. We're looking for someone named...

310
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:50,975
Who rolled a +9 dork spell and
summoned the beast and his quadruped?

311
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:57,314
I know you're busy not fiting in, but
can you tell me where I can find Arthur?

312
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:58,755
He's over there.

313
00:27:18,946 --> 00:27:23,349
There is no sweeter taste
on thy tongue than victory!

314
00:27:25,786 --> 00:27:28,653
Strong, handsome, face of a leader.

315
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:32,122
Does Arthur look like a king or what?

316
00:27:33,294 --> 00:27:34,625
Sorry.

317
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,990
Did you say you were looking for Arthur?

318
00:27:38,132 --> 00:27:40,566
That information is
on a need-to-know basis.

319
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,396
It's top secret!

320
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:46,131
Now, gentlemen, let's away.
To the showers!

321
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:50,269
Greetings, Your Majesty.

322
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:51,969
This is your lucky day.

323
00:27:52,813 --> 00:27:54,906
What are you supposed to be?

324
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:58,314
Some kind of giant mutant leprechaun
or something?

325
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,812
Giant mutant... You made a funny.

326
00:28:03,324 --> 00:28:05,258
Unhand me, monster!

327
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,360
Stop squirming, Arthur.

328
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:09,827
I'm not Arthur.

329
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:14,357
I am Lancelot.

330
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:17,164
That dork over there is Arthur.

331
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,439
This is, like, totally embarrassing...

332
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,173
...but Tiffany thinkest
thou vex her so soothly.

333
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:31,716
She thought perchance thou would
ask her to the Homecoming Dance.

334
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:32,944
Excuse me?

335
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:37,023
Like, whatever. She's into college guys
and mythical creatures.

336
00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:42,554
Oh, Arthur...

337
00:28:42,696 --> 00:28:46,393
...come out, come out, wherever you are!

338
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,063
You beter run,
you litle punk no-goodniks!

339
00:28:51,205 --> 00:28:54,606
The days of Donkey Dumpy Drawers
are over!

340
00:29:00,714 --> 00:29:02,045
Hold it.

341
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:04,775
We're here for the mascot contest.

342
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,653
We're here for the mascot contest, too.

343
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,318
This is a costume?

344
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,453
Worked on it all night long.

345
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,596
Looks prety real to me.

346
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:23,134
If he were real, could I do this?

347
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,466
Or this?

348
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:32,610
If it were real, that would have been
agonizingly painful.

349
00:29:32,746 --> 00:29:35,943
- Now watch this!
- That's quite enough, boys.

350
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:39,883
Thank you to Professor Primbotom
and his lecture...

351
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,419
...on "just say nay".

352
00:29:42,356 --> 00:29:46,622
And now, without further ado, let's give
a warm Worcestershire hoozah...

353
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,252
...to the winner
of our mascot contest, the...

354
00:29:51,432 --> 00:29:52,421
...ogre?

355
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,799
That's right. I'm the new mascot.

356
00:29:56,937 --> 00:30:00,566
So let's really try and beat
the other guys at...

357
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:03,836
...whatever it is they're doing!

358
00:30:07,381 --> 00:30:10,373
This is all a bit unorthodox...

359
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:14,180
Where can I find Arthur Pendragon?

360
00:30:16,457 --> 00:30:17,947
Hey, wait...

361
00:30:22,062 --> 00:30:23,689
Olassic.

362
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:25,526
You should be ashamed of yourself!

363
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:28,066
I didn't do it. They did.

364
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,602
Please don't eat me.

365
00:30:34,742 --> 00:30:37,074
Eat him! Eat him! Eat him!

366
00:30:38,078 --> 00:30:40,740
I'm not here to eat him!

367
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:44,844
Time to pack up
your toothbrush and jammies.

368
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:47,215
You're the new King of Far Far Away.

369
00:30:47,354 --> 00:30:49,015
What?

370
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:54,755
Artie a king?
More like the Mayor of Loserville!

371
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,489
Burn.

372
00:31:04,104 --> 00:31:05,230
Is this for real?

373
00:31:05,372 --> 00:31:09,775
Absolutely. Olean out your locker, kid.
You have a kingdom to run.

374
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,572
So, wait... l'm really the only heir?

375
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,245
The one and only.

376
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,244
Give me a second.

377
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,248
My good people...

378
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:25,119
...there's a lesson here for all of us.

379
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:29,559
Next time you're about to dunk a kid's
head in a chamber pot, stop and think,

380
00:31:29,697 --> 00:31:32,188
#VALUE!

385
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,815
I'm looking at you, jousting team!

386
00:31:51,151 --> 00:31:54,348
And Guin? Oh, Guin.

387
00:31:55,222 --> 00:31:56,553
I've always loved you.

388
00:31:58,425 --> 00:32:00,985
Good friends, it breaks my heart, but...

389
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:04,620
...enjoy your stay here in prison
while I rule the free world!

390
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:06,357
Okay, let's not overdo it.

391
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,833
I'm building my city, people...
on rock 'n' roll!

392
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,835
You just overdid it.

393
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,608
Look at you!

394
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,274
You look darling.

395
00:32:24,418 --> 00:32:26,613
Just precious. Look at her.

396
00:32:26,754 --> 00:32:29,120
Any cravings since you got pregnant?

397
00:32:29,256 --> 00:32:31,884
No. Not at all.

398
00:32:32,726 --> 00:32:34,455
Do you smell ham?

399
00:32:34,595 --> 00:32:37,723
It's present time!

400
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,661
Fiona, please open mine first.
It's the one in front.

401
00:32:43,804 --> 00:32:48,434
"Oongratulations on your new
mess mak... Oh, mess maker!"

402
00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:51,567
"Hopefully this helps.
Love, Oinderella."

403
00:32:52,913 --> 00:32:54,574
- Look at that!
- What is it?

404
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,618
It's for the poopies.

405
00:32:58,752 --> 00:33:00,310
Wait... babies poop?

406
00:33:00,454 --> 00:33:01,785
Everyone poops, Beauty.

407
00:33:01,922 --> 00:33:03,389
Fiona!

408
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:06,357
We all chipped in
for a litle present, too.

409
00:33:07,261 --> 00:33:08,819
Ta-da!

410
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,863
You know the baby will love it,
because I do!

411
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,969
Guys, that's so sweet. Thank you.

412
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:17,502
Who's this one from?

413
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:20,573
I got you the biggest one,
because I love you most.

414
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,767
Have one on me. Love, Snow White.

415
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:28,240
What is it?

416
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:29,906
He's a live-in babysiter.

417
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,142
Where's the baby?

418
00:33:31,285 --> 00:33:35,346
You're too kind, Snow,
but I can't accept this.

419
00:33:35,489 --> 00:33:37,855
It's nothing. I have six more at home.

420
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:39,754
- What does he do?
- Oleaning.

421
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,485
- Feeding.
- Burping.

422
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:44,096
So, what are
Shrek and I supposed to do?

423
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,358
Work on your marriage.

424
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,368
Thanks, Rapunzel.
What's that supposed to mean?

425
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:54,531
Oome on now, Fiona.
You know what happens.

426
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:57,501
You're tired all the time.

427
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:59,373
You start leting yourself go.

428
00:33:59,513 --> 00:34:00,673
Stretch marks.

429
00:34:00,814 --> 00:34:02,145
Say goodbye to romance.

430
00:34:04,485 --> 00:34:07,921
I'm sorry, but how many
of you have kids?

431
00:34:08,055 --> 00:34:09,613
She's right!

432
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:14,193
A baby will only strengthen the love
Shrek and Fiona have.

433
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:17,161
How did Shrek react when you told him?

434
00:34:18,332 --> 00:34:21,495
When he first found out, Shrek said...

435
00:34:34,348 --> 00:34:38,682
Onward, my new friends!
To our happily ever afters!

436
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:46,519
Now... bombs away!

437
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:05,910
Well, well, well. If it isn't Peter Pan.

438
00:35:06,046 --> 00:35:08,514
- His name's not Peter.
- Shut it, Wendy.

439
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:30,730
Enough pillaging! To the castle!

440
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:50,556
You go! Take care of the baby!

441
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:53,854
Everybody stay calm! We're going to die!

442
00:35:58,265 --> 00:36:00,392
Everyone in! Now!

443
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,661
Oome on! Put some back into it!

444
00:36:06,006 --> 00:36:07,496
We don't have time. Now go!

445
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:09,438
Quickly, ladies!

446
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:13,270
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

447
00:36:28,962 --> 00:36:31,362
Where are Shrek and Fiona?

448
00:36:31,498 --> 00:36:33,659
The name doesn't ring a bell.

449
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,495
No bell.

450
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:39,003
I suggest you freaks cooperate...

451
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:41,733
...with the new King of Far Far Away!

452
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:45,572
The only thing you're ever gonna
be king of is King of the Stupids!

453
00:36:45,712 --> 00:36:48,010
- Hook!
- Right!

454
00:36:48,148 --> 00:36:50,378
Avast, ye cookie.

455
00:36:52,986 --> 00:36:54,647
Start talking.

456
00:36:59,026 --> 00:37:00,516
- Gingy!
- Papa!

457
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:02,026
Setle down now.

458
00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:19,308
On the good ship Lollipop

459
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,882
It's a sweet trip to the candy shop

460
00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:24,005
You!

461
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:27,046
You can't lie.

462
00:37:27,187 --> 00:37:30,850
So tell me, puppet... where is Shrek?

463
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,091
Well... I don't know where he's not.

464
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,425
You don't know where Shrek is?

465
00:37:39,566 --> 00:37:42,160
It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume...

466
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:46,568
...that I couldn't exactly not say that
is or isn't almost partially incorrect.

467
00:37:46,707 --> 00:37:48,072
So you do know where he is!

468
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:50,733
On the contrary,
I'm possibly more or less

469
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:53,107
not definitely rejecting the idea

470
00:37:53,246 --> 00:37:56,909
that in no way,
with any amount of uncertainty...

471
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,039
Stop it!

472
00:37:58,185 --> 00:38:00,312
...I do not know where he shouldn't be.

473
00:38:00,454 --> 00:38:02,922
If that indeed wasn't where he isn't.

474
00:38:03,056 --> 00:38:06,651
Even if he wasn't not where
I knew he was, it could mean...

475
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:09,023
On the good ship Lollipop

476
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:13,565
Enough! Shrek went off
to bring back the next heir!

477
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,367
He's bringing back the next heir?

478
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:19,995
No!

479
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:24,438
Hook! Get rid of this new "King".

480
00:38:24,578 --> 00:38:26,443
But bring Shrek to me.

481
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,777
I have something special
in mind for him.

482
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:32,077
He'll never fall for your tricks!

483
00:38:33,754 --> 00:38:35,415
Oh, boy.

484
00:38:45,265 --> 00:38:48,291
I can't believe it. Me, a king?

485
00:38:48,435 --> 00:38:51,461
I knew I came from royalty, but...

486
00:38:51,605 --> 00:38:53,698
...I figured everyone forgot about me.

487
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,571
Oh, no. In fact the King
asked for you personally.

488
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:00,271
Really? Wow.

489
00:39:01,615 --> 00:39:03,845
But I know it's not all fun and games.

490
00:39:03,984 --> 00:39:06,976
It really is
all fun and games, actually.

491
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,715
Sure, you have to knight a few heroes,
launch a ship or two.

492
00:39:10,857 --> 00:39:15,191
By the way, make sure you hit the boat
just right with the botle.

493
00:39:15,328 --> 00:39:18,126
Any idiot can hit a boat with a botle.

494
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:21,900
Well, I've heard
it's harder than it looks.

495
00:39:22,035 --> 00:39:24,003
This is going to be huge.

496
00:39:24,137 --> 00:39:29,006
Parties, princesses,
castles. Princesses.

497
00:39:29,142 --> 00:39:32,009
You'll be living in the lap of luxury.

498
00:39:32,145 --> 00:39:34,613
The finest chefs
will wait for your order.

499
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:37,717
And fortunately,
you'll have the royal food tasters.

500
00:39:37,851 --> 00:39:39,546
What do they do?

501
00:39:39,686 --> 00:39:44,282
Taste the food before the King eats,
to make sure it's not poisoned.

502
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:47,018
- Poisoned?
- Or too salty.

503
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,687
Don't worry. Your bodyguards
will keep you safe.

504
00:39:50,831 --> 00:39:53,095
All of them willing
at a moment's notice

505
00:39:53,233 --> 00:39:56,066
to lay down their lives
out of devotion to you.

506
00:39:56,203 --> 00:39:57,636
Really?

507
00:39:57,771 --> 00:40:00,797
The whole kingdom will look
to you for wisdom and guidance.

508
00:40:01,174 --> 00:40:03,108
Make sure they don't die of famine!

509
00:40:03,243 --> 00:40:04,972
- Or plague.
- Plague is bad.

510
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,012
The coughing, the groaning,
the festering sores.

511
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:14,020
Festering sores!
You are one funny kity cat.

512
00:40:14,688 --> 00:40:16,087
What did I say?

513
00:40:16,223 --> 00:40:18,589
We don't want Artie
geting the wrong idea.

514
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,519
Artie?

515
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,561
There goes my hip!

516
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,861
Artie! What are you doing?

517
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,931
What does it look like?!

518
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:38,077
This really isn't up to you.

519
00:40:38,211 --> 00:40:41,078
I don't know anything about being king!

520
00:40:41,214 --> 00:40:43,148
You'll learn on the job!

521
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:47,576
Sorry, but I'm going back.

522
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:50,155
Back to what? Being a loser?

523
00:40:53,727 --> 00:40:55,285
Now look what you did!

524
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:59,896
Look what I did?
_
Who's holding the wheel, chief?

525
00:41:00,901 --> 00:41:02,391
Shrek!

526
00:41:14,748 --> 00:41:16,739
Land ho!

527
00:41:29,262 --> 00:41:31,093
How humiliating.

528
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:35,033
Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

529
00:41:35,168 --> 00:41:38,865
Now it's "Your Highness"?
What happened to "loser"?

530
00:41:39,005 --> 00:41:41,906
If you think this is geting you
out of anything, it isn't.

531
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:45,808
We're heading back to Far Far Away
one way or another...

532
00:41:45,946 --> 00:41:48,380
...and you're going to be a father!

533
00:41:48,515 --> 00:41:49,948
What?

534
00:41:50,784 --> 00:41:52,342
You just said "father".

535
00:41:52,485 --> 00:41:55,215
King! You're going to be king!

536
00:41:55,355 --> 00:41:58,347
You're going to be king! Yeah, right.

537
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:00,992
Where are you going?

538
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:03,595
Far Far Away... from you!

539
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,698
Get back here, young man!

540
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:10,158
Boss? I don't think he's coming back.

541
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:13,500
Maybe it's for the best.
He's not exactly king material.

542
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,871
When did you plan to tell him
you were supposed to be king?

543
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,843
Oome on. Why would I do that?

544
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,040
Besides, he'll be ten times
beter at it than me.

545
00:42:23,183 --> 00:42:27,142
Then change your tactics
if you want to get anywhere with him.

546
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:31,320
You're right, Donkey.

547
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,184
What about this?

548
00:42:35,328 --> 00:42:39,162
- Shrek!
- Oome on. It's just a joke.

549
00:42:40,734 --> 00:42:42,065
Still...

550
00:42:58,852 --> 00:43:00,513
Listen, Artie.

551
00:43:01,087 --> 00:43:06,218
If you think this whole mad scene
ain't dope, I feel you, dude.

552
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:10,489
I'm not trying to get up in your grill
or raise your roof.

553
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,757
But what I am screamin' is, yo...

554
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:16,096
...check out this
kazing thazing, bazaby!

555
00:43:16,236 --> 00:43:18,329
If it doesn't groove, or what I'm saying

556
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:21,406
ain't straight trippin',
say, "Oh, no, you didn't!

557
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:23,975
You're geting on my last nerve."

558
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:27,102
And then I'll know it's...
I'll know it's wack!

559
00:43:28,715 --> 00:43:29,909
Help!

560
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,451
I've been kidnapped by a monster
who's trying to relate to me!

561
00:43:33,586 --> 00:43:37,215
- Artie, wait.
- Oome on! Help! Hello?

562
00:43:38,725 --> 00:43:42,422
Greetings, cosmic children
of the universe.

563
00:43:42,562 --> 00:43:44,496
Welcome to my serenity circle.

564
00:43:44,631 --> 00:43:48,761
Please leave any bad vibes
outside the healing vortex.

565
00:43:48,902 --> 00:43:50,733
Now prepare to...

566
00:43:56,409 --> 00:43:59,242
I knew I should have got that warranty!

567
00:44:02,148 --> 00:44:03,615
Mr. Merlin?

568
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,217
You know this guy?

569
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:09,617
Yeah. He was the school magic teacher,
until he had his nervous breakdown.

570
00:44:09,756 --> 00:44:13,123
Technically, I was merely a victim
of a level 3 fatigue.

571
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:15,352
At the request of my therapist,

572
00:44:15,495 --> 00:44:19,124
and the school authorities, I retired
to the tranquility of nature

573
00:44:19,265 --> 00:44:21,426
to discover my divine purpose.

574
00:44:22,936 --> 00:44:26,337
Oan I interest anyone
in a snack or beverage?

575
00:44:26,473 --> 00:44:27,565
Uh, no.

576
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:31,040
Sure you don't want to try
my Rock Au Gratin?

577
00:44:33,947 --> 00:44:35,414
It's organic.

578
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,982
Thanks. I ate a boulder on the way in.

579
00:44:38,118 --> 00:44:41,053
We need directions to Far Far Away.

580
00:44:41,187 --> 00:44:43,712
We? Who said I was going with you?

581
00:44:43,857 --> 00:44:48,226
I did. People are counting on you,
so don't try to weasel out of it.

582
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:50,420
If the job's so great, you do it.

583
00:44:50,964 --> 00:44:55,230
Understand this, kid. No more
Mr. Nice Guy from here on out.

584
00:44:55,368 --> 00:44:57,666
That was your Mr. Nice Guy?

585
00:44:57,804 --> 00:44:59,738
Yeah, and I'm going to miss him.

586
00:44:59,873 --> 00:45:04,276
Why don't you go terrorize a village
and leave me alone!

587
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,938
Was that a crack about ogres? You get
your royal highness to Far Far Away...

588
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:13,109
...before I kick it there!
Now, which way am I kicking?

589
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:15,084
I could tell you, but since you're

590
00:45:15,221 --> 00:45:17,746
in the midst
of a self-destructive rage spiral,

591
00:45:17,891 --> 00:45:20,416
it would be karmically irresponsible.

592
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,223
Self-destructive?
Are you going to help us or not?

593
00:45:24,364 --> 00:45:26,958
Most definitely, but only after you

594
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,297
take the journey to your soul!

595
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,801
I don't think so.

596
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:35,772
It's either that
or primal scream therapy.

597
00:45:37,844 --> 00:45:40,506
All right. Journey to the soul.

598
00:45:41,347 --> 00:45:43,212
Now, all of you,

599
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:45,874
look into the Fire of Truth

600
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:49,011
and tell me what you see.

601
00:45:51,858 --> 00:45:53,723
Ooh, charades!

602
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,627
Okay, I see a Dutch fudge torte
with cinnamon swirls!

603
00:45:58,765 --> 00:46:01,359
Okay, monster... go for it.

604
00:46:10,043 --> 00:46:11,738
I see a rainbow pony.

605
00:46:11,878 --> 00:46:13,812
Excellent work! Now the boy.

606
00:46:13,947 --> 00:46:15,414
This is lame.

607
00:46:15,548 --> 00:46:17,812
You're lame! Now just go for it.

608
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:20,716
Okay.

609
00:46:21,554 --> 00:46:25,991
There's a baby bird and a father bird
siting in a nest.

610
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:28,116
Yes! Stay with it!

611
00:46:28,962 --> 00:46:32,955
The dad just flew away. Why did
he leave the litle bird all alone?

612
00:46:33,633 --> 00:46:37,069
It's trying to fly,
but it doesn't know how to.

613
00:46:37,971 --> 00:46:40,132
It's going to fall!

614
00:46:44,978 --> 00:46:48,971
Proper head case you are.
Really messed up.

615
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:57,312
Okay, I get it. The bird's me.
My dad left. So what?

616
00:47:09,335 --> 00:47:11,997
Look, Artie, um...

617
00:47:16,342 --> 00:47:19,106
Just thought I'd help set the mood...

618
00:47:19,245 --> 00:47:22,578
...for your big heart-to-heart chat.

619
00:47:31,024 --> 00:47:34,357
I know what it's like
to not feel ready for something.

620
00:47:36,696 --> 00:47:39,028
Even ogres get scared.

621
00:47:39,866 --> 00:47:42,699
You know... once in a while.

622
00:47:44,704 --> 00:47:48,470
I know you want me
to be king, but I can't.

623
00:47:48,608 --> 00:47:51,475
I'm not cut out for it,
and I never will be.

624
00:47:52,378 --> 00:47:54,869
Even my own dad knew
I wasn't worth the trouble.

625
00:47:55,014 --> 00:47:58,211
He dumped me at that school
first chance he got...

626
00:47:58,885 --> 00:48:01,217
...and I never heard from him again.

627
00:48:02,889 --> 00:48:06,723
My dad wasn't really
the fatherly type, either.

628
00:48:07,226 --> 00:48:09,387
I doubt he was worse than mine.

629
00:48:10,229 --> 00:48:11,526
Oh, yeah?

630
00:48:11,664 --> 00:48:15,725
My father was an ogre.
He tried to eat me.

631
00:48:16,569 --> 00:48:18,764
I guess I should have realized it.

632
00:48:18,905 --> 00:48:23,171
He bathed me in barbecue sauce and
put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.

633
00:48:25,078 --> 00:48:27,569
I guess that's prety bad.

634
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:32,111
It may be hard to believe,

635
00:48:32,251 --> 00:48:35,709
what, with my obvious charm
and good looks,

636
00:48:35,855 --> 00:48:38,790
but people used
to think I was a monster.

637
00:48:38,925 --> 00:48:42,588
And for a long time, I believed them.

638
00:48:44,597 --> 00:48:46,189
But after a while,

639
00:48:46,332 --> 00:48:49,859
you learn to ignore
the names people call you

640
00:48:50,003 --> 00:48:52,335
and just trust who you are.

641
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,603
You know... you're okay, Shrek.

642
00:48:58,444 --> 00:49:02,005
You just need to do a litle less
yelling and use a litle more soap.

643
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:04,976
Thanks, Artie.

644
00:49:05,118 --> 00:49:08,781
The soap's because
you stink... really bad.

645
00:49:09,956 --> 00:49:12,447
Yeah... I got that.

646
00:49:16,462 --> 00:49:19,329
This place is filthy!

647
00:49:19,632 --> 00:49:21,224
I feel like a hobo.

648
00:49:22,468 --> 00:49:25,232
I'm sorry, but this
isn't working for me.

649
00:49:25,371 --> 00:49:29,933
Everything's always about you.
It's not like your atitude is helping.

650
00:49:30,076 --> 00:49:33,773
Maybe itjust bothers you
I was voted fairest in the land.

651
00:49:33,913 --> 00:49:36,006
You mean in that rigged election?

652
00:49:36,149 --> 00:49:39,118
Give me a break. "Rapunzel, Rapunzel...

653
00:49:39,252 --> 00:49:42,380
...let down thy golden extensions!"

654
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:47,323
Ladies, let go of your pety complaints
and let's work together!

655
00:49:50,296 --> 00:49:53,288
So I guess the plan is
we just wander aimlessly

656
00:49:53,433 --> 00:49:55,526
in this stinkhole until we rot.

657
00:49:55,668 --> 00:49:59,195
No, we get inside and find out
what Oharming's up to.

658
00:49:59,338 --> 00:50:02,034
I know he's a jerk and everything,

659
00:50:02,175 --> 00:50:06,339
but that Oharming
makes me hoter than July.

660
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,011
That's it!

661
00:50:37,043 --> 00:50:39,409
Oome on! This way!

662
00:50:39,545 --> 00:50:40,534
Rapunzel, wait!

663
00:50:50,056 --> 00:50:51,887
Oharming, let go of her.

664
00:50:52,024 --> 00:50:54,652
But why would I want to do that?

665
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:01,188
What?

666
00:51:01,334 --> 00:51:06,431
Say hello, ladies,
to the new Queen of Far Far Away.

667
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:12,240
Rapunzel, how could you?

668
00:51:12,378 --> 00:51:14,642
Jealous much?

669
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,214
Soon you'll be back
where you started,

670
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,978
scrubbing floors
or locked away in towers.

671
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,748
That is, if I let you last the week.

672
00:51:26,058 --> 00:51:28,652
Pookie, you promised not to hurt them.

673
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:32,787
Not here, kiten whiskers.
Daddy will discuss it later.

674
00:51:33,533 --> 00:51:36,058
Now forgive us.
We have a show to put on.

675
00:51:36,202 --> 00:51:39,467
Shrek will be back soon,
and you'll be sorry.

676
00:51:39,605 --> 00:51:41,004
Sorry?!

677
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:45,406
Don't you realize once Shrek
sets foot in Far Far Away...

678
00:51:45,545 --> 00:51:47,308
...he's doomed?

679
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,479
Look out! They got a piano!

680
00:52:28,621 --> 00:52:31,988
Kill them all... except the fat one.

681
00:52:32,124 --> 00:52:36,493
King Oharming has something special
in mind for you, ogre.

682
00:52:36,629 --> 00:52:37,926
King Oharming?

683
00:52:38,064 --> 00:52:39,088
Atack!

684
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:46,531
Artie, duck!

685
00:53:01,087 --> 00:53:02,349
Ready the plank!

686
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,731
- Shrek!
- Help!

687
00:53:39,058 --> 00:53:40,355
Oowards!

688
00:53:40,493 --> 00:53:42,859
What has Oharming done with Fiona?

689
00:53:42,995 --> 00:53:45,589
She's going to get what's coming to her.

690
00:53:46,165 --> 00:53:51,068
And there ain't nothing
you can do to stop him!

691
00:53:51,203 --> 00:53:53,728
- We've got to save her.
- But she's so far far away!

692
00:53:54,674 --> 00:53:56,972
Get yourself back
to Worcestershire, kid.

693
00:53:57,109 --> 00:54:00,601
No, Shrek. Hold on. I've got an idea.

694
00:54:00,746 --> 00:54:03,010
I am a buzzing bee.

695
00:54:03,683 --> 00:54:06,880
Mr. Merlin?
They need a spell to get them...

696
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:10,045
...I mean us, back to Far Far Away.

697
00:54:10,189 --> 00:54:13,625
Forget it. I don't have that kind
of magic in me anymore.

698
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:17,456
How about a hug?
That's the best kind of magic.

699
00:54:17,596 --> 00:54:19,962
Please. I know you can do it.

700
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:21,896
I said forget it!

701
00:54:22,034 --> 00:54:23,365
But...

702
00:54:30,776 --> 00:54:32,368
What's with you?

703
00:54:33,713 --> 00:54:36,876
It's just so hard, you know?

704
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:41,680
They need to get back,
'cause their kingdom's in trouble.

705
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:44,346
'Oause there's a really bad man.

706
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,253
It's just so hard!

707
00:54:46,392 --> 00:54:48,519
Take it easy.

708
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:52,028
No! I don't think you understand!

709
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:56,692
There's a mean person doing
mean things to good people.

710
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:58,531
Have a heart, old man.

711
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:02,835
They really need your help to get back.
Why won't you help them?!

712
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,271
Okay.

713
00:55:08,414 --> 00:55:10,405
I'll go get my things.

714
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:14,379
Piece of cake.

715
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:18,047
Well, well. You want eggs with that ham?

716
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,887
I am a litle rusty, so there
could be some side effects.

717
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,494
- Side effects?
- Don't worry.

718
00:55:23,629 --> 00:55:27,395
Whatever it is, no mater
how excruciatingly painful,

719
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:30,696
it will wear off eventually. I think.

720
00:55:32,671 --> 00:55:34,901
- Oops.
- You sure about this?

721
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,170
If Artie trusts him,
that's good enough for me.

722
00:55:39,311 --> 00:55:41,176
Even if his robe doesn't cover...

723
00:55:41,313 --> 00:55:43,838
Alacritious expeditious...

724
00:55:43,983 --> 00:55:46,679
...a- zoomy-zoom-zoom!

725
00:55:46,819 --> 00:55:49,652
Let's help our friends get back...

726
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:53,722
...soon!

727
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,658
It worked!

728
00:56:11,377 --> 00:56:14,403
I haven't been on a trip
like that since college!

729
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,109
Donkey?

730
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:19,081
What? Is something in my teeth?

731
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,514
Oh, no! I've been abracadabra-ed into
a Fancy Feastin', second-rate sidekick!

732
00:56:28,861 --> 00:56:32,922
At least you don't look
like some kind of bloated piñata!

733
00:56:33,065 --> 00:56:35,124
You should think about going on a diet!

734
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:39,863
You should get yourself a pair of pants.
I feel all exposed and nasty!

735
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,872
So you two think this is funny?

736
00:56:46,378 --> 00:56:48,175
I'm really sorry, guys.

737
00:56:48,314 --> 00:56:50,782
Don't be. You got us back, kid.

738
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:58,582
How in the Hans Ohristian Andersen

739
00:56:58,724 --> 00:57:01,488
am I supposed to parade around
in these goofy boots?

740
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:04,460
Hey, hey, hey!
Be very careful with those.

741
00:57:05,898 --> 00:57:09,231
They were made in Madrid
by the finest...

742
00:57:09,902 --> 00:57:11,893
You'll learn to control that.

743
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:19,801
Seriously. Ow! You need some comfort
inserts or arch supports or something.

744
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:30,854
Watch it. I'm walking here
and I'm gonna keep going until...

745
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:32,082
Pinocchio!

746
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:34,850
Shrek! Help me!

747
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:38,191
- What happened?
- Oharming and the villains took over!

748
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:42,096
Fiona and the Princesses got away.
Now she's...

749
00:57:42,234 --> 00:57:43,758
She's what?! What?!

750
00:57:46,105 --> 00:57:47,936
Puss! Loan me five bucks.

751
00:57:48,073 --> 00:57:50,303
You heard him. Help the brother out.

752
00:57:50,442 --> 00:57:52,535
Do you see any pockets on me?

753
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,509
Hold on a second.

754
00:57:57,016 --> 00:58:01,180
I had no idea, really. I... I swear.

755
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,549
Quick! Where is Fiona?

756
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:08,456
Oharming has her locked away
someplace. You have to find him!

757
00:58:08,594 --> 00:58:11,461
He's probably geting ready
for the show!

758
00:58:11,597 --> 00:58:13,929
Wait, Pinocchio! What show?

759
00:58:18,938 --> 00:58:21,338
It's a Happily Ever After After All.

760
00:58:21,473 --> 00:58:23,805
Shrek's final performance?

761
00:58:23,943 --> 00:58:28,073
Shrek! You didn't tell us
you were in a play!

762
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:31,671
I guess I've been so busy
I forgot to mention it.

763
00:58:31,817 --> 00:58:33,375
The ogre! Get him!

764
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,052
Don't worry, jefe. I got this.

765
00:58:43,596 --> 00:58:45,223
Uck! Kill it!

766
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:51,362
Look. Don't you know who
he thinks he is? How dare you!

767
00:58:51,503 --> 00:58:53,027
We're dealing with amateurs.

768
00:58:53,172 --> 00:58:58,109
He's a star, people! Hello?
I'm so sorry about this, Mr. Shrek.

769
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,767
I'm going to lose it!

770
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:03,712
Is everything ready? You did get
the list for the dressing room?

771
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:06,943
Breakfast croissant stuffed
with seared sashimi tuna.

772
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:10,385
And I hope you have the saffron corn
with jalapeno honey buter.

773
00:59:10,522 --> 00:59:13,514
Our client cannot get
into his proper emotional state

774
00:59:13,659 --> 00:59:15,456
withoutjalapeno honey buter!

775
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:16,993
I just lost it.

776
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:20,288
They should talk to Nancy
in Human Resources.

777
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:23,924
Oh, we will have much to say
to Nancy, I promise!

778
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:29,301
With this sword, I do... No. "With..."

779
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:33,104
With this sword, I do smote thee!

780
00:59:34,013 --> 00:59:36,481
Is "smote" the right word? "Smoot"?

781
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:38,480
I don't think that's a word.

782
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:42,951
Maybe I should just "smite" him.
Let's try this again. Now...

783
00:59:44,123 --> 00:59:47,286
Shrek atacks me.
I pretend to be afraid.

784
00:59:48,027 --> 00:59:52,430
"Now the kingdom will get the happily
ever after they deserve. Die, ogre!"

785
00:59:52,564 --> 00:59:56,227
Blah, blah, blah. Oh,
itjust doesn't feel real enough!

786
00:59:58,137 --> 01:00:00,162
Who told you to stop dancing?!

787
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,772
Wink and turn.

788
01:00:01,907 --> 01:00:05,138
What are you laying around for?
Get up! Honestly!

789
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:17,016
Our happily ever after
is nearly complete, Mummy.

790
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:19,351
And I assure you...

791
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:24,485
...the people of this kingdom
will pay dearly for every second...

792
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:27,325
...we've had to wait.

793
01:00:28,934 --> 01:00:30,367
Break a leg.

794
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:33,266
On second thought,
let me break it for you.

795
01:00:33,405 --> 01:00:37,705
Thank goodness. I was afraid
you wouldn't get back in time.

796
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:39,470
Where's Fiona?

797
01:00:39,611 --> 01:00:43,843
Don't worry. She and the others
are safe... for now.

798
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:56,358
Let me guess. Arthur.

799
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:59,054
It's Artie, actually.

800
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:04,192
This boy is supposed to be
the new King of Far Far Away?

801
01:01:06,105 --> 01:01:07,402
How pathetic.

802
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:10,406
Stand still, so I won't make a mess.

803
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,978
Oharming, stop! I'm here now.
You got what you wanted.

804
01:01:14,113 --> 01:01:15,774
This isn't about him.

805
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:20,882
Then who's it about?
I'm supposed to be king, right?

806
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:26,590
You weren't really next in line
for the throne.

807
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:28,124
I was.

808
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,593
But you said the King
asked for me personally.

809
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,561
Not exactly.

810
01:01:33,699 --> 01:01:35,132
What does that mean?

811
01:01:35,267 --> 01:01:37,758
I said whatever I had to say, all right?

812
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:41,600
I wasn't right for the job,
so I needed some fool to replace me.

813
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:45,403
And you fit the bill. So just go!

814
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,539
You were playing me the whole time.

815
01:01:50,682 --> 01:01:52,445
You catch on real fast, kid.

816
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:55,678
Maybe you're not
as big of a loser as I thought.

817
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:04,460
You know, for a minute...

818
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:06,496
...I actually thought...
- What?

819
01:02:06,632 --> 01:02:10,124
That he cared about you? He's an ogre.

820
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:12,100
What did you expect?

821
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:26,107
You really do have a way
with children, Shrek.

822
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:42,263
Leave me out with the waste

823
01:02:42,401 --> 01:02:45,336
This is not what I do

824
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:49,167
It's the wrong time

825
01:02:49,308 --> 01:02:52,004
She's pulling me through

826
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:55,841
It's a small crime

827
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:58,609
And I got no excuse

828
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:01,150
And is that all right, yeah?

829
01:03:02,621 --> 01:03:04,646
Is that all right with you?

830
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:09,824
Is that all right, yeah?

831
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:14,322
If I give my gun away when it's loaded?

832
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:21,165
If you don't shoot it
how am I supposed to hold it?

833
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:27,210
Is that all right?
Is that all right?

834
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:30,782
Is that all right with you?

835
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:31,383
No.

836
01:03:31,383 --> 01:03:31,781
No.

837
01:03:32,117 --> 01:03:33,948
Had we stayed put like I suggested,

838
01:03:34,086 --> 01:03:36,884
we'd be sipping tea
out of litle heart-shaped cups.

839
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,546
Yeah, heart-shaped cups.

840
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,318
And eating crumpets
smothered with loganberries.

841
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,052
Yeah, loganberries.

842
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:45,060
- Shut up, Oindy.
- Yeah, shut up.

843
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:48,064
- No, you shut up.
- Stay out of this.

844
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,998
Who cares who's "running the kingdom"?

845
01:03:51,136 --> 01:03:54,367
- I care.
- You should all care.

846
01:03:58,343 --> 01:04:01,244
I have your badge number, tin can!

847
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,245
- Donkey?
- Princess!

848
01:04:03,382 --> 01:04:04,371
Puss?

849
01:04:04,516 --> 01:04:08,577
I am Puss, stuck here
inside this hideous body.

850
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,744
And I'm me!

851
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:11,014
But you're...

852
01:04:11,156 --> 01:04:13,818
Everything's fruity in the loops,
but what happened is

853
01:04:13,959 --> 01:04:15,927
we went to high school,
the boat crashed

854
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:18,621
and we got bippity-boppity-booped
by the magic man.

855
01:04:18,764 --> 01:04:20,959
You poor sweet things.

856
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:22,498
I don't get it.

857
01:04:22,634 --> 01:04:26,365
The cat turned into a litle horse
that smells like feet. What's to get?

858
01:04:26,505 --> 01:04:27,870
Who dat?

859
01:04:28,006 --> 01:04:29,030
Where's Shrek?

860
01:04:29,174 --> 01:04:33,167
Oharming has him. He plans to kill Shrek
tonight in front of the whole kingdom!

861
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:38,743
All right, everyone.
We need to find a way out now.

862
01:04:38,884 --> 01:04:42,411
You're right.
Ladies, assume the position!

863
01:04:47,292 --> 01:04:48,486
What are you doing?

864
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:50,626
Waiting to be rescued.

865
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:52,730
You've got to be kidding me.

866
01:04:52,864 --> 01:04:55,628
What else can we do? We're just four...

867
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:59,066
...I mean three, super-hot princesses...

868
01:04:59,204 --> 01:05:03,265
...two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre
and an old lady!

869
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:08,443
Excuse me. Old lady coming through.

870
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,852
Mom!

871
01:05:18,991 --> 01:05:23,257
You didn't think you got your fighting
skills from your father, did you?

872
01:05:23,395 --> 01:05:26,125
Excuse me. There's still one more.

873
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:38,640
Why don't you just lie down?

874
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:44,180
Okay, girls, from here on out...

875
01:05:44,316 --> 01:05:46,784
...we take care of business ourselves.

876
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:08,363
The Far Far Away Theatre at the
Charming Pavilion is proud to present...

877
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:10,270
..."It's A Happily Ever After
After AII."

878
01:06:10,409 --> 01:06:13,708
Enjoy your evening
of theatrical reverie, citizen.

879
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:17,178
Oi! No food or beverages in the theater!

880
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:32,394
Places, everyone!

881
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:38,662
Easy!

882
01:06:38,804 --> 01:06:42,706
Sorry. I was showing off
for the litle one.

883
01:06:43,442 --> 01:06:47,037
It's Bring Your Kids to Work Day.
Oome here, beautiful.

884
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:53,207
Well, she's got your eye.

885
01:06:54,453 --> 01:06:59,390
Who would have thought a monster like
me deserved something as special as you?

886
01:07:41,066 --> 01:07:44,092
Little birdies, take wing

887
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:47,564
Flitting down from the trees they appear

888
01:07:47,706 --> 01:07:50,174
And to chirp in my ear

889
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:54,435
All because I sing

890
01:08:24,075 --> 01:08:25,133
Move it! Go!

891
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:33,479
My babies!

892
01:08:34,486 --> 01:08:35,475
Help!

893
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:23,023
Hey, how's it goin'?

894
01:09:33,712 --> 01:09:35,646
O to the K. The coast is clear.

895
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:38,408
Let's do this. Go, Team Dynamite!

896
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:42,384
I thought we agreed to use the name
Team Super Oool.

897
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,750
I recall it was Team Awesome.

898
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,823
I voted for Team Alpha Wolf Squadron.

899
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:48,926
Okay! From henceforth,

900
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:53,190
we will be Team Alpha Super Awesome
Oool Dynamite Wolf Squadron.

901
01:09:53,331 --> 01:09:57,563
Ach de liebe! There is some strange
litle girl over there staring at us!

902
01:09:58,503 --> 01:09:59,868
Artie!

903
01:10:00,005 --> 01:10:01,370
Wait, wait!

904
01:10:01,506 --> 01:10:03,701
Where is the fire, señor?

905
01:10:03,842 --> 01:10:05,867
Please. Don't act so innocent.

906
01:10:06,011 --> 01:10:09,777
You both knew what was going on
and kept it to yourselves.

907
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,506
It's not like it seems.

908
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:14,483
It's not? I think it seems prety clear.

909
01:10:14,619 --> 01:10:17,144
He was using me. That's all.

910
01:10:17,289 --> 01:10:19,723
Using you? You really don't get it.

911
01:10:19,858 --> 01:10:22,850
Shrek only said
those things to protect you.

912
01:10:23,528 --> 01:10:28,192
Oharming was going to kill you, Artie!
Shrek saved your life.

913
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:40,369
Oue the spot!

914
01:10:44,215 --> 01:10:46,740
I wait alone up here

915
01:10:46,885 --> 01:10:49,581
I'm trapped another day

916
01:10:49,721 --> 01:10:52,918
Locked up here, please set me free

917
01:10:53,058 --> 01:10:56,084
My new life I almost see

918
01:10:56,227 --> 01:10:58,923
A castle, you and me

919
01:10:59,064 --> 01:11:04,161
Yes, a castle, you and me

920
01:11:06,237 --> 01:11:07,295
Oherubs!

921
01:11:11,242 --> 01:11:15,042
Tis I, Tis I
Upon my regal steed

922
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,807
Princess, my love

923
01:11:16,948 --> 01:11:19,712
At last you shall be freed
I'm strong

924
01:11:19,851 --> 01:11:21,819
And brave
And dashing my way there

925
01:11:22,253 --> 01:11:27,919
With speed! With might!
With soft and bouncy hair!

926
01:11:28,893 --> 01:11:32,659
- Through the blistering desert
- Hot!

927
01:11:32,797 --> 01:11:35,823
- Across the stormiest sea
- Wet!

928
01:11:35,967 --> 01:11:37,958
Facing creatures so vile

929
01:11:38,103 --> 01:11:39,229
Foul!

930
01:11:39,371 --> 01:11:43,501
So you can gaze upon me!

931
01:11:44,809 --> 01:11:47,141
I knew you'd come for me

932
01:11:47,278 --> 01:11:51,112
And now we finally meet

933
01:11:51,249 --> 01:11:52,716
I knew you'd wait

934
01:11:52,851 --> 01:11:57,379
And from my plate of love you'd eat

935
01:12:17,308 --> 01:12:20,641
Who is this terribly ugly fiend
Who so rudely intervened?

936
01:12:20,779 --> 01:12:22,610
Will Charming fight or flee?

937
01:12:22,747 --> 01:12:23,805
Please rescue me!

938
01:12:23,948 --> 01:12:25,643
From this monstrosity!

939
01:12:25,784 --> 01:12:30,812
Fear thee not, honey lamb!
I will slice this thing up like a ham!

940
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:33,457
Oh, boy.

941
01:12:33,591 --> 01:12:37,186
You are about to enter a world of pain

942
01:12:37,328 --> 01:12:41,662
With which you are not familiar!

943
01:12:45,103 --> 01:12:49,506
It can't be any more painful
than your lousy performance.

944
01:12:53,178 --> 01:12:55,169
Prepare, foul beast.

945
01:12:57,282 --> 01:13:00,547
Prepare, foul beast, your time is done!

946
01:13:00,685 --> 01:13:03,848
Oould you kill me and then sing?

947
01:13:05,356 --> 01:13:07,051
Be quiet!

948
01:13:07,192 --> 01:13:11,322
I'm just having fun with you.
That's actually a very nice leotard.

949
01:13:11,463 --> 01:13:12,725
Thank you.

950
01:13:12,864 --> 01:13:14,957
Do they come in men's sizes?

951
01:13:18,036 --> 01:13:19,765
Now that be funny!

952
01:13:19,904 --> 01:13:21,872
Enough!

953
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:28,075
Now you'll finally
know what it's like...

954
01:13:28,213 --> 01:13:31,740
...to have everything you worked for...

955
01:13:31,883 --> 01:13:35,910
...everything that's precious to you,
taken away.

956
01:13:36,054 --> 01:13:39,387
Now you'll know how I felt.

957
01:13:46,731 --> 01:13:48,392
Sausage roll!

958
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:08,275
Pray for mercy from Puss!

959
01:14:08,419 --> 01:14:09,909
And Donkey!

960
01:14:10,121 --> 01:14:11,179
D

961
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,462
Hi, honey.

962
01:14:23,601 --> 01:14:26,627
Sorry we're late. You okay?

963
01:14:26,771 --> 01:14:29,103
Much beter, now that you're here.

964
01:14:31,776 --> 01:14:36,975
So, Oharming, you want to let me out of
these so we can setle this ogre-to-man?

965
01:14:37,115 --> 01:14:41,449
Ooh, that sounds fun.
But I have a beter idea.

966
01:14:57,302 --> 01:14:59,702
No! Let go of me!

967
01:14:59,837 --> 01:15:03,967
You will not ruin things
this time, ogre. Kill it.

968
01:15:07,812 --> 01:15:09,575
Everybody, stop!

969
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:13,509
Oh, what is it now?!

970
01:15:13,651 --> 01:15:14,913
Artie?

971
01:15:24,596 --> 01:15:27,064
Who thinks we need
to setle things this way?

972
01:15:31,336 --> 01:15:35,033
You mean you want to be villains
your whole lives?

973
01:15:35,173 --> 01:15:38,973
But we are villains!
It's the only thing we know.

974
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:41,544
You never wish
you could be something else?

975
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:45,137
Easy for you to say. You're not
some evil enchanted tree.

976
01:15:45,283 --> 01:15:48,047
You morons! Don't listen to him! Atack!

977
01:15:48,186 --> 01:15:50,984
What Steve means is
it's hard to come by honest work

978
01:15:51,122 --> 01:15:53,147
when the whole world's against you.

979
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:55,020
Right. Thanks, Ed.

980
01:15:55,159 --> 01:15:59,562
Fair enough. You're right.
I'm not a talking tree.

981
01:15:59,697 --> 01:16:00,789
But you know...

982
01:16:00,932 --> 01:16:04,060
...a good friend once told me...

983
01:16:04,202 --> 01:16:09,230
...just because people treat you
like a villain, or an ogre...

984
01:16:09,374 --> 01:16:11,365
...orjust some loser...

985
01:16:12,877 --> 01:16:14,777
...doesn't mean you are one.

986
01:16:17,649 --> 01:16:21,517
What maters most
is what you think of yourself.

987
01:16:21,653 --> 01:16:25,953
If there's something you really want,
or someone you want to be...

988
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:29,719
...the only person standing
in your way is you.

989
01:16:30,228 --> 01:16:31,991
- Me?
- Get him!

990
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:33,529
No, no, no!

991
01:16:33,665 --> 01:16:36,600
What I mean is each of you...

992
01:16:36,734 --> 01:16:38,998
...is standing in your own way.

993
01:16:42,907 --> 01:16:45,398
I always wanted to play the flute.

994
01:16:45,543 --> 01:16:49,206
I'd like to open up a spa... in France!

995
01:16:49,347 --> 01:16:53,909
I grow daffodils. And they're beautiful.

996
01:17:42,633 --> 01:17:45,796
A new era finally begins!

997
01:17:47,638 --> 01:17:49,299
Now all of you...

998
01:17:50,141 --> 01:17:52,541
...bow before your King!

999
01:17:58,983 --> 01:18:01,315
You need to work on your aim.

1000
01:18:03,654 --> 01:18:06,521
This was supposed to be
my happily ever after!

1001
01:18:06,657 --> 01:18:09,148
Well, you need to keep looking...

1002
01:18:11,162 --> 01:18:13,221
...because I'm not giving up mine.

1003
01:18:18,503 --> 01:18:19,663
Mommy?

1004
01:18:31,015 --> 01:18:33,176
It's yours if you want it.

1005
01:18:33,851 --> 01:18:36,183
But this time it's your choice.

1006
01:18:58,876 --> 01:18:59,900
Author!

1007
01:19:00,044 --> 01:19:03,377
Artie! Artie! Artie! Artie!

1008
01:19:07,718 --> 01:19:10,710
Excuse me. That's my seat.

1009
01:19:11,722 --> 01:19:16,489
Okay, Señor Hocusy-Pocusy, the time
has come to rectify some wrongs!

1010
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:19,152
Though I have been enjoying
these cat baths.

1011
01:19:19,297 --> 01:19:20,787
Please say you didn't.

1012
01:19:20,932 --> 01:19:22,832
All right! Look.

1013
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:26,266
You'll feel a pinch and possibly
lower intestinal discomfort...

1014
01:19:26,404 --> 01:19:28,736
...but this should do the trick.

1015
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:35,445
- Are you?
- I'm me again!

1016
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:37,844
- And I am not you!
- All right!

1017
01:19:39,417 --> 01:19:40,577
Oops.

1018
01:19:42,587 --> 01:19:43,986
Ah, never mind.

1019
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:52,053
What did I tell you?
The kid's going to be a great king.

1020
01:19:52,196 --> 01:19:55,757
Well, for what it's worth,
you would have, too.

1021
01:19:57,268 --> 01:20:00,260
I have something
much more important in mind.

1022
01:20:25,796 --> 01:20:27,024
Finally.

1023
01:20:33,804 --> 01:20:35,135
Dada.

1024
01:20:37,241 --> 01:20:41,610
Was I wrong about the world?
It's a beautiful new place

1025
01:20:41,746 --> 01:20:44,237
I smell Shrek Junior!

1026
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:47,044
Where else could a creep like me

1027
01:20:47,184 --> 01:20:49,914
Meet such a pretty face

1028
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:53,990
Meeting every day with the rising sun

1029
01:20:56,794 --> 01:20:59,695
Looking up, it's looking like

1030
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:02,492
My losing streak is done

1031
01:21:03,401 --> 01:21:04,698
Peek-a-boo!

1032
01:21:04,835 --> 01:21:06,166
Peek-a-boo!

1033
01:21:09,373 --> 01:21:11,204
A bouncy, bouncy, boy!

1034
01:21:11,342 --> 01:21:14,038
Used to always feel like

1035
01:21:14,178 --> 01:21:16,840
Wished that I was dressed better

1036
01:21:17,848 --> 01:21:19,509
Where's the baby?

1037
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:24,019
Never had a lot of luck
Until I finally met her

1038
01:21:33,531 --> 01:21:37,524
Meeting every day with the rising sun

1039
01:21:40,204 --> 01:21:42,365
Looking up, it's looking like

1040
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,873
My losing streak is done

1041
01:21:48,045 --> 01:21:50,377
My losing streak is done

1042
01:22:01,225 --> 01:22:03,887
Well... what shall we do now?

1043
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:21,571
I got it.

1044
01:22:28,085 --> 01:22:32,454
Puss and Donkey, baby!
Once again, come on!

1045
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:37,220
I want to thank you for letting me
be myself

1046
01:22:37,361 --> 01:22:38,453
Again!

1047
01:22:38,596 --> 01:22:40,461
Look at my hips!

1048
01:22:40,598 --> 01:22:45,797
I want to thank you for letting me
be myself

1049
01:22:45,936 --> 01:22:47,426
Again!

1050
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:54,234
- Break it down!
- Let's go!

1051
01:22:54,378 --> 01:22:56,778
Stiff all in the collar

1052
01:22:58,616 --> 01:23:00,777
Fluffy in the face

1053
01:23:02,953 --> 01:23:05,444
Chit chat chatter trying

1054
01:23:06,791 --> 01:23:08,952
Stuffy in the place

1055
01:23:11,128 --> 01:23:13,961
Thank you for the par-tay

1056
01:23:15,132 --> 01:23:16,997
But I could never stay

1057
01:23:17,134 --> 01:23:18,465
I'm sorry.

1058
01:23:19,136 --> 01:23:22,128
I got many things on my mind

1059
01:23:23,474 --> 01:23:25,635
But the word's in the way

1060
01:23:26,644 --> 01:23:31,843
And I want to thank you for letting me
be myself

1061
01:23:31,982 --> 01:23:33,313
Again

1062
01:23:34,318 --> 01:23:36,286
Different strokes for different folks

1063
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:40,015

01:23:43,828 --> 01:23:45,318
Break it down!

1066
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:49,493
Puss and Donkey, baby!
Puss and Donkey, baby!

1067
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,661
Puss and Donkey, baby!

1068
01:23:53,003 --> 01:23:55,164
Dance to the music

1069
01:23:57,007 --> 01:23:59,339
All night long

1070
01:24:01,345 --> 01:24:03,677
Everyday people

1071
01:24:05,349 --> 01:24:07,510
Sing a simple song

1072
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,011
Mama's so happy

1073
01:24:13,858 --> 01:24:15,849
Mama start to cry

1074
01:24:18,028 --> 01:24:20,519
Papa's still singing

1075
01:24:21,699 --> 01:24:25,191
You can make it if you try
So try!

1076
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:30,238
Thank you for letting me be myself

1077
01:24:30,374 --> 01:24:31,705

01:24:38,716 --> 01:24:40,411
Again

1080
01:24:40,551 --> 01:24:43,418
Oome on, Donkey. Do something right!

1081
01:24:43,554 --> 01:24:45,954
Put the hoofs together!
Put the hoofs together!

1082
01:24:47,057 --> 01:24:51,255
Stomp your boots, baby! Stomp your
boots, baby! Stomp your boots, baby!

1083
01:24:51,395 --> 01:24:55,263
Thank you for letting me be myself

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1088
01:25:08,078 --> 01:25:11,275
Want to thank you
Just to be my

1089
01:25:11,415 --> 01:25:14,282
Because I just want to be my...
See?

1090
01:25:14,418 --> 01:25:17,114
Can I, can I thank you!
Can I

01:25:17,254 --> 01:25:19,085
Yes! Yes!
