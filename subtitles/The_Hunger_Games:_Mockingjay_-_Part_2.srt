I was supposed
to give it to the pig.

That was the first

Because you were kind

- Did people say you love me?

tortured you. To hurt me.

Our instructions are
to shoot propaganda footage

522
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,411
on the battle-scarred streets
of The Capitol.

523
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,847
You were handpicked
to intimidate their forces.

524
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,769
And inspire surrenders.

525

I guarantee you,
wherever they put us,

00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,049
it will not be safe.
This is a war zone.

529
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,731
It is likely that we'll
encounter both active pods

530
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,529
and Peacekeepers.

531
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,720
You're considered high-value

<i>In the event of capture,</i>

do the honors.

536
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,088
I've already

00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,766
<i>I remind you,
they are on every block.</i>

538
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,889
<i>Our unit has
been given a Holo.</i>

539
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,086
A database that contains
a detailed map of The Capitol

540
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,202
and a list of every known pod.

541
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,045
These pods can trigger
anything from bombs,

542
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,487
to traps, to mutts.

543
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,562
<i>We cannot move
without this device.</i>

544
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,881
<i>There's no guarantee
that our database is complete.</i>

545
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,840
<i>There could be new pods
that we're not aware of.</i>

546
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,325
Because we don't want
the Gamemakers to know

547
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,370
we have this intel,
it has a self-destruct on it.

548
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,807
You flip this switch,
say "nightlock" three times,

549
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,611
<i>and it blows itself and anything
within a 10-foot radius.</i>

550
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,650
<i>Stay within our unit.</i>

551

Even with the Holo,

552
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,204
it is likely that new pods
have been set.

I'm not sure
that kind of a comment

recommends you for the job,
either, soldier.

607

608

or anything she can't control.</i>

617
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,642
So she would
put my life in danger?

618
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,484
She'd deny it, but...

619
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,565
What?

620
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,720
One way or another, this war

622

see you as a threat.

623

I'd be a leader.

your support to someone.</i>

<i>Would it be her?</i>

626
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,610
And if your immediate answer
isn't "yes,"

627
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,444
then you're dangerous.

you could do now

to this rebellion.

632
