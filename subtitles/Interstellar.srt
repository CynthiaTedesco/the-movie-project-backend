00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:08,340
NARRATOR: <i>Humans are natural-born explorers.</i>

2
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:12,928
<i>We charge into uncharted territory
and seek out the unknown.</i>

3
00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:16,557
<i>We</i> '<i>ve mapped nearly every inch</i>
<i>of Mother Earth.</i>..

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,936
...<i>and left tracks on the moon.</i>

5
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:23,522
<i>But to set foot on another planet.</i>..

6
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:26,025
...<i>to travel beyond our solar system.</i>..

7
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:28,694
...<i>that is a dream for the future.</i>

8
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:37,911
<i>A dream that comes to life</i>
<i>in the feature film</i> Interstellar.

9
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:45,294
BRAND: <i>We must think not as individuals</i>
<i>but as a species.</i>

10
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:49,298
<i>We must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.</i>

11
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:59,808
NARRATOR: <i>The film</i> Interstellar <i>deals with the</i>
<i>quest for new worlds and the fate of humanity.</i>

12
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,811
<i>Sound like the stuff of science fiction?</i>

13
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:04,813
<i>Maybe.</i>

14
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,652
<i>But the foundations of this film</i>
<i>are rooted in real science.</i>..

15
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:14,406
...<i>thanks to the involvement</i>
<i>of renowned astrophysicist Kip Thorne.</i>

16
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:18,327
In <i>Interstellar,</i>
one of the most important features...

17
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:22,998
...is the way that the science
is totally embedded in the film.

18
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:24,958
There are some wiId things in here.

19
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:31,340
NARRATOR: <i>Beyond fantasy and fiction,</i>
<i>this is the real science of</i> Interstellar.

20
00:01:39,848 --> 00:01:42,851
<i>Space travel has been a staple of the movies</i>
<i>from the very beginning.</i>..

21
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:46,605
...<i>but the feature film</i> Interstellar
<i>has a unique pedigree.</i>

22
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:49,525
<i>lt was inspired in part</i>
<i>by the work of Kip Thorne.</i>..

23
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:55,489
...<i>an authority on astrophysics,</i>
<i>gravitational waves.</i>..

24
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:58,409
...<i>and the warping of space-time.</i>

25
00:01:58,575 --> 00:02:01,620
<i>He</i>'<i>s also an executive producer</i>
<i>on the film.</i>

26
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:07,793
In <i>Interstellar,</i> real science was built
into the fabric of the fiIm from the outset.

27
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:14,007
The other major players in this film,
they all respected the science...

28
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:18,095
...and they worked with me to see
that the science was well incorporated.

29
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:24,727
Can you tell me what the easiest definition
of what a singuIarity is?

30
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:29,940
Kip and myself meshed well
in terms of trying to use current thinking...

31
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:33,235
...current scientific understanding
to drive the narrative.

32
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:34,778
The Ianguage we use...

33
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:41,285
...is it's a pIace where the curvature
of space and time gets infinitely high.

34
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,536
So we're good, okay.

35
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:46,915
And we just hope that the research we've done
and the conversations I'd had with Kip...

36
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:50,461
...and that Chris had had with Kip
informed the narrative...

37
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:52,504
...and that the audience would feel that.

38
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:55,799
NOLAN:
Why simply imagine, fantasize...

39
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:59,595
...about things that might happen in space
or on an interstellar journey?

40
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,931
Why not actuaILy Look
at, uh, the real science there?

41
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:07,060
It's an Indian surveilIance drone.

42
00:03:07,227 --> 00:03:09,146
NARRATOR:
Interstellar <i>takes place in a future.</i>..

43
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:13,066
...<i>where living conditions on Earth</i>
<i>threaten the survival of humanity.</i>

44
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:17,112
BRAND: Your daughter's generation
will be the last to survive on Earth.

45
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:20,616
COOPER: Now you need to teII me
what your plan is to save the world.

46
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,994
BRAND: We're not meant to save the worId,
we're meant to leave it.

47
00:03:24,953 --> 00:03:28,582
One of the things that the fiIm expIores is,
do we belong on Earth...

48
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:31,877
...and shouId we be staying on Earth...

49
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:35,088
...and if there is anything else out there,
shouId we be exploring that?

50
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:36,715
Here we go.

51
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:39,510
NARRATOR: <i>ln the film,</i>
<i>the crew seeks a new place to call home.</i>

52
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:41,345
<i>A planet that can sustain life.</i>

53
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:43,305
<i>Human life.</i>

54
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:44,723
-I'm not gonna make it!
-Yes, you are.

55
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,851
It's an exciting concept
that there may be other worlds out there.

56
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,230
Well, what are those worlds
and what couId they be...

57
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:53,315
...and is there a pIace for us out there?

58
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,400
NARRATOR:
<i>The search for another Earth.</i>..

59
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:58,362
...<i>sounds like a job</i>
<i>for the explorers of tomorrow.</i>..

60
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:01,657
...<i>but it's happening right now.</i>

61
00:04:05,118 --> 00:04:09,331
<i>Astrophysicist Natalie Batalha
is a passionate planet hunter.</i>

62
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:13,252
BATALHA: I think the only way that we're going
to realLy understand our pIace in the gaIaxy...

63
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:19,007
...is by Looking at this broad picture
and understanding the diversity of all pIanets.

64
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:21,218
Twenty or 30 years ago, we didn't know...

65
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:25,806
...of any other planets orbiting normaI stars
Like our own sun.

66
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:29,393
NARRATOR: <i>Natalie has helped</i>
<i>rewrite that story as mission scientist.</i>..

67
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,478
...<i>for NASA</i> '<i>s</i> KepIer <i>space telescope.</i>

68
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:33,939
BATALHA:
<i>Kepler's</i> objective is very simpIe.

69
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:37,401
It's to determine the fraction of stars
in our galaxy...

70
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:41,363
...that harbor potentially habitable
Earth-size planets.

71
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,824
NARRATOR: <i>And what makes a planet</i>
<i>potentially habitable?</i>

72
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:47,035
The one ingredient that we think
is common to all life forms...

73
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:49,872
...is this requirement of Iiquid water.

74
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:52,624
So that's why we look for planets
that have rocky surfaces...

75
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,959
...where water could pooI...

76
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:57,212
...and that are receiving the right amount
of energy from the star...

77
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:01,216
...where the water wouIdn't be locked up
in a frozen state because the planet is so cold...

78
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:04,928
...nor would it be evaporated away
because the planet is too hot.

79
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:09,516
We call it the Gold ilocks Zone,
where Iiquid water could potentially exist.

80
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:12,728
NARRATOR:
<i>Launched in 2009,</i> KepIer <i>stared.</i>..

81
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:17,399
...<i>at one small patch of the Milky Way</i>
<i>for four years straight.</i>

82
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:21,945
<i>Compared to stars,</i>
<i>planets are too tiny for</i> KepIer <i>to spot.</i>..

83
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:24,239
...<i>but it can detect their shadows.</i>

84
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:29,661
BATALHA: Every planet orbiting a Iuminous
object is casting a shadow out into space.

85
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:32,497
The <i>Kepler</i> spacecraft makes use
of that fact...

86
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:37,294
...waiting for a planet
in its orbit about the star...

87
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:41,256
...to pass directly between
the disc of the star and the spacecraft...

88
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:46,178
...and the telescope perceives that
as a dimming of light.

89
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,598
NARRATOR: <i>This simple method</i>
<i>has revealed thousands of exoplanets.</i>

90
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,727
<i>Planets orbiting other stars in our galaxy.</i>

91
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:55,103
What we've learned so far...

92
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,651
...is that literally every star in the galaxy
has at least one planet.

93
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:05,238
There's an amazing diversity
of exoplanets out there...

94
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:07,407
...and we've found very exotic worlds.

95
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:12,329
Two hundred light-years away,
there is a Saturn-size planet orbiting...

96
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:14,998
...not one, but two stars.

97
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:18,377
So if you were living
on a world like KepIer-16B...

98
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:22,714
...you would see in the sky two stars
rising in the east, setting in the west...

99
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:27,552
...continuously changing position
as they orbit one another.

100
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:33,642
This is an artist's rendition
of the planet KepIer-10B.

101
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:39,982
It's orbiting 23 times closer to its parent star
than Mercury is to our own sun.

102
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:45,278
So this star-facing side is just
being blasted by stellar radiation...

103
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:49,741
...creating temperatures
in excess of that required to melt iron.

104
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:54,204
The planet has an entire hemisphere
larger than the Pacific Ocean...

105
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:57,374
...which is an ocean,
but it's not an ocean of water.

106
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,751
It's an ocean of molten lava.

107
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:03,130
NARRATOR:
<i>Not an attractive destination.</i>

108
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:08,969
<i>But</i> Kepler <i>recently found us</i>
<i>a possible second home.</i>

109
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:12,848
This is an artist's concept
of the KepIer-186 planetary system.

110
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,059
Five planets orbiting this M-type star...

111
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:20,355
...and the outermost planet is KepIer-186F.

112
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:26,528
Our first discovery of an Earth-size planet
in the habitable zone of a normal star.

113
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:32,451
When l think about KepIer-186F,
I try to imagine it as a real place...

114
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:34,870
...because it is a real place.

115
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,081
We know that it could be rocky,
it's the same size as Earth...

116
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:40,917
...so I do imagine a rocky surface.

117
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:45,672
We don't know that it has a liquid ocean,
but we can certainly imagine one.

118
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:48,508
And then, all of a sudden
in your imagination...

119
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:51,470
...you internalize the existence
of this world out there...

120
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:54,973
...that there is a place
that could be very, very much like Earth.

121
00:07:56,058 --> 00:08:00,562
NARRATOR: <i>So when do we set sail</i>
<i>for these distant shores?</i>

122
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:02,731
<i>Reality check.</i>

123
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:08,195
<i>Kepler-</i> <i>186F is nearly 3 quadrillion miles</i>
<i>from Earth.</i>

124
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:11,198
<i>Otherwise put, 500 light-years away.</i>

125
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,244
<i>That's a journey of 500 years
at the speed of light.</i>

126
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:19,664
<i>But no thing can travel as fast as light.</i>

127
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:22,834
<i>At best, our spacecrafts
are thousands of times slower.</i>

128
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:25,837
<i>Even the spaceships in</i> Interstellar
<i>don't come close.</i>

129
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:29,174
BRAND: We need the bravest humans
to find us a new home.

130
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:32,385
COOPER: But the nearest star
is over a thousand years away.

131
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:34,179
-Hence the bravery.
-Okay.

132
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:38,100
NARRATOR: <i>So how do they reach new worlds</i>
<i>beyond our solar system?</i>

133
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:42,896
<i>They take a walk on the warp side
of space and time.</i>

134
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:49,319
MURPH:
You have no idea when you're coming back.

135
00:08:50,403 --> 00:08:53,281
AMELIA: Couldn't you have told her
you were going to save the world?

136
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:54,699
No.

137
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:58,328
I'm coming back.

138
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:04,543
NARRATOR: <i>When we journey to a far-off place,</i>
<i>we travel not just in space but also in time.</i>..

139
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,337
...<i>as we move into the future.</i>

140
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:15,387
<i>Until about a century ago, scientists believed
that space and time were entirely separate.</i>

141
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:22,727
<i>Theoretical physicist Sean Carroll explains
how Albert Einstein overturned that idea.</i>

142
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:24,938
CARROLL:
One of Einstein's great insights...

143
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:27,566
...was that space and time
were related to each other...

144
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:29,609
...where you have space and you have time.

145
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:33,530
Einstein says, "There's only one thing
which we call space-time."

146
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:37,117
And then he says, "This space-time thing...

147
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:41,288
...it's not just the stage
on which all the action plays out.

148
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:42,622
It's an actor itself."

149
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:50,463
Space-time can change, it can move,
it can bend, and it can warp.

150
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:59,139
NARRATOR: <i>Einstein</i> '<i>s theory of relativity</i>
<i>states that space-time is like a flexible fabric.</i>

151
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:06,188
<i>The objects embedded in it:
The sun, planets, even us, warp that fabric.</i>

152
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:10,859
<i>And the consequence of that warping
is what we call gravity.</i>

153
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:14,988
<i>The more massive the object,</i>
<i>the more space-time is warped.</i>..

154
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:17,532
...<i>and the greater the gravity.</i>

155
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:23,496
<i>We feel gravity.</i>

156
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,669
<i>The flexibility of space-time</i>
<i>is harder to grasp on a gut level.</i>..

157
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:32,464
...<i>but its effects are measurable.</i>

158
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:41,348
<i>As Sean demonstrates, the greater the gravity,
the more slowly time flows.</i>

159
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:44,309
CARROLL: For example,
if I were on the ground floor with a clock...

160
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,478
...a super accurate atomic clock...

161
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:49,314
...and a twin of mine was up
on the top floor of a building...

162
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:51,316
...with an equally accurate atomic clock...

163
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:55,904
...if we later on compared them,
mine would have ticked off fewer seconds.

164
00:10:57,322 --> 00:11:01,243
NARRATOR: <i>On the ground floor,</i>
<i>Sean experiences slightly more gravity.</i>..

165
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:03,620
...<i>than his twin on the top floor.</i>

166
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:07,499
<i>He also experiences slightly less time
than his twin.</i>

167
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,294
<i>The difference is tiny, but real.</i>

168
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:13,421
<i>And there are practical applications.</i>

169
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:17,259
CARROLL: For example, the GPS system,
the Global Positioning System...

170
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:20,637
...that is a very, very precise set of clocks...

171
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:23,098
...on satellites orbiting around the Earth...

172
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:27,477
...and that orbit is in a slightLy different
gravitational field than we are in down here.

173
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:32,232
So the fact that time moves differently
here on the surface of the Earth...

174
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,734
...than in the satelIite orbit,
is very, very important...

175
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:36,987
...to getting the GPS to work correctly.

176
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:41,825
NARRATOR: <i>Time on a GPS satellite clock</i>
<i>advances faster than a clock on Earth.</i>..

177
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,327
...<i>by about 38 microseconds per day.</i>..

178
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,080
...<i>so the system</i>'<i>s computers correct for that.</i>

179
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,836
<i>Motion also affects our experience
of space-time.</i>

180
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,755
CARROLL:
The best way to say it is just staying still...

181
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:58,675
...means that you experience
the most time that you can.

182
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:02,679
Moving around and doing things
means you experience less time.

183
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:07,684
NARRATOR: <i>Let's revisit Sean at the wheel</i>
<i>of his car and his twin on a park bench.</i>

184
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:10,979
If you move out on your car,
and then you come back...

185
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,940
...compared to the person
who stayed behind...

186
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:16,526
...your clock that you took with you
on that journey...

187
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:20,488
...will have experienced a little bit less time
than the one who stayed behind.

188
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,994
NARRATOR: <i>We normally move too slowly</i>
<i>to notice the effect.</i>

189
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:30,040
<i>But if Sean could drive</i>
<i>near the speed of light.</i>..

190
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:35,378
...<i>he could race across the United States</i>
<i>and back again a million times.</i>..

191
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:38,465
...<i>and experience less</i>
<i>than a second of time.</i>..

192
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:40,425
...<i>while the twin he le* behind.</i>..

193
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:43,511
...<i>would endure hours of waiting</i>
<i>for Sean</i> '<i>s return.</i>

194
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:49,642
<i>ln other words, Sean would've traveled
into the future compared to his twin.</i>

195
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:53,688
<i>This means space travel may get tricky
in years to come.</i>

196
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:58,526
<i>The faster our spaceships,</i>
<i>the greater the gravity fields we encounter.</i>..

197
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:02,572
...<i>the further out of sync we may become</i>
<i>with those we leave behind.</i>

198
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:06,284
COOPER:
So if we find a home, then what?

199
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:08,870
Every hour is seven years back on Earth.

200
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:14,918
NARRATOR: <i>The relativity of time is the source</i>
<i>of hardship and heartbreak in</i> Interstellar.

201
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:19,047
The theory of relativity
is fascinating all by itself...

202
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:22,133
...but it immediately becomes
something very emotional...

203
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,595
...when you talk about
the distances between people.

204
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:29,349
You know, we all spend time
away from our families.

205
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:34,062
I just thought, what if you could take that
to its logical and very bittersweet extreme?

206
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:38,483
NOLAN: For me, it was very exciting
to be able to examine the concept...

207
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,027
...of the subjective experience of time.

208
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:43,738
It's really the first time
I've had an objective structure...

209
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:46,825
...around the film saying
that time literally is relative...

210
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:50,370
...that we all experience time differently
depending on where we are in the universe.

211
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:54,207
NARRATOR: <i>But the warping of space-time</i>
<i>may also provide shortcuts.</i>..

212
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,293
...<i>that could make interstellar travel a snap.</i>

213
00:13:58,586 --> 00:13:59,796
<i>Wormholes.</i>

214
00:14:00,797 --> 00:14:02,590
<i>They're a staple of science fiction.</i>..

215
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:06,428
...<i>but they're based on real science.</i>

216
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:12,142
Einstein's relativistic laws
govern the warping of space and time...

217
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:16,438
...and they say that wormholes might exist,
they could exist.

218
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:20,316
So this dates all the way back to 1916.

219
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:26,531
CARROLL: A wormhole is a particular way
that space and time can be curved.

220
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:31,077
It's like adding a little tube
that connects two parts of space.

221
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:36,708
The basic idea is that if you're an ant
and you live on the surface of the apple...

222
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,502
...the surface of the apple
is your entire universe.

223
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:44,382
You can go around the outside
through the universe itself...

224
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:47,260
...or you can go through the wormhole.

225
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:52,223
NARRATOR: <i>But Einstein's equations also</i>
<i>predict that if wormholes do form in nature.</i>..

226
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,726
...<i>they may be subatomic in size.</i>..

227
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:58,980
...<i>and exist for only fractions of a second</i>
<i>before closing</i> off.

228
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:04,360
<i>Theoretically, what would it take</i>
<i>to keep a wormhole open.</i>..

229
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:07,405
...<i>and make it big enough</i>
<i>to accommodate a spaceship ?</i>

230
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:10,950
THORNE: It turns out that in order
to hold a wormhole open...

231
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:14,913
...so it doesn't crunch off and kill you
when you try to go through...

232
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:21,711
...that you have to have the wormhole threaded
by a negative mass or negative energy.

233
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:24,088
Einstein says
mass and energy are equivalent.

234
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,220
NARRATOR: <i>Almost all the forms of matter</i>
<i>we know have positive mass and exert gravity.</i>

235
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,098
<i>Negative mass would exert antigravity.</i>..

236
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:37,977
...<i>and repel the walls of a wormhole</i>
<i>to keep it open.</i>

237
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:43,483
Strangely, it is true
that negative energy can exist...

238
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:48,196
...and it's been created in the laboratory,
but only in very tiny amounts.

239
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:50,823
NARRATOR:
<i>It would take vast quantities.</i>..

240
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,494
...<i>to prop open a wormhole</i>
<i>large enough for a spaceship.</i>

241
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:57,664
<i>But just maybe, in the future.</i>..

242
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:02,627
...<i>engineers will devise</i>
<i>advanced technologies to do just that.</i>

243
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:07,006
Today it's an educated guess,
maybe I should say a half-educated guess...

244
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:10,510
...that wormholes cannot exist
in our universe...

245
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:12,679
...but we're far from sure of that.

246
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:15,723
CARROLL:
The truth is, we just don't know right now.

247
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,643
We don't understand the laws of physics
well enough to say for sure...

248
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,436
...whether or not wormholes are possible.

249
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:25,942
NARRATOR: <i>But since they're not impossible,</i>
<i>they're fair game for a filmmaker.</i>

250
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:29,779
I was very excited about the idea
of focusing on a family...

251
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:31,698
...who would be the pioneers...

252
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:36,119
...who would experience some of
the extraordinary features of astrophysics...

253
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:41,165
...particularly the idea of a wormhole
that would allow us to travel to distant stars.

254
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,420
NARRATOR: <i>To create a wormhole</i>
<i>based on real science.</i>..

255
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,840
...<i>Visual Effects supervisor Paul Franklin</i>
<i>turned to Kip Thorne.</i>

256
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:54,554
FRANKLIN: The popular image
of what a wormhole might look like...

257
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:56,681
...is literally just a hole in space.

258
00:16:56,848 --> 00:17:00,977
It sits on an invisible surface,
you see stuff sliding down the sides...

259
00:17:01,144 --> 00:17:03,313
...and disappearing down the drain,
as it were.

260
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:06,065
And right in that first conversation,
Kip showed me an image...

261
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:09,068
...of that kind of classical fantasy image
of these things...

262
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:13,573
...and said, "This is all wrong."
Ha, ha. "This is not how it is."

263
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:17,827
NARRATOR: <i>Kip worked out the scientific</i>
<i>equations that define the wormhole.</i>..

264
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,538
...<i>and sent them to Paul's animators</i>
<i>back in London.</i>

265
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:24,500
THORNE: And so for the movie,
I built a mathematical model wormhole...

266
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:28,046
...based on Einstein's relativity equations.

267
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:32,925
Paul, Kip and myself, we discussed,
"Okay, we'll visualize the thing.

268
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:36,095
We'll simulate the thing
exactly as the calcuIations say."

269
00:17:36,262 --> 00:17:39,140
And Paul Franklin and his team,
they were thrilled to get algorithms...

270
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:42,769
...that were the absolute latest,
most interesting and up-to-the-minute.

271
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:44,312
MAN:
Now we can go to the other one.

272
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,898
The wormhole
is a three-dimensional hole in space.

273
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:50,026
What do you get if you take a circle
and sweep it out in three dimensions?

274
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:51,444
You get a sphere.

275
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:55,823
So the wormhole almost feels like
a crystal ball hanging in space.

276
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:02,413
THORNE: I don't think anybody had ever
really done this kind of visualization before.

277
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,665
This is really unique.

278
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:08,378
Uh, first time for me,
as well as for you and the audience.

279
00:18:08,544 --> 00:18:09,629
Absolutely, yes.

280
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,009
NARRATOR: <i>ln</i> Interstellar, <i>crew members</i>
<i>take a giant leap of faith.</i>..

281
00:18:15,176 --> 00:18:17,470
...<i>when they plunge into a wormhole.</i>

282
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:20,181
DOYLE: You can't think about your family.
You have to think bigger.

283
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:24,394
COOPER: I am thinking about my family
and millions of other families.

284
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,563
AMELIA: You might have to decide
between seeing your children again...

285
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,357
...and the future of the human race.

286
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:33,986
NARRATOR: <i>Beyond the wormhole,</i>
<i>the crew will face a far greater challenge:</i>

287
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:38,366
<i>To navigate the perils of a black hole.</i>

288
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:43,830
<i>For a filmmaker, that threat
is full of dramatic possibilities.</i>

289
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:49,711
NOLAN: When you venture out into a story
about a man against the elements...

290
00:18:49,877 --> 00:18:56,467
...visualizing the threat against our protagonist
become very much more exotic.

291
00:18:56,968 --> 00:19:02,056
Deep, deep space gives you
a very, very fresh approach.

292
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:05,768
NARRATOR: <i>Black holes were predicted</i>
<i>by Einstein</i> '<i>s equations.</i>..

293
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:08,730
...<i>but physicists questioned</i>
<i>whether they could really exist.</i>

294
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:11,399
THORNE:
A black hole is a strange beast.

295
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:15,111
If this were a black hole,
then instead of a rubber surface...

296
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:18,489
...it would have a surface
that is made of absolutely nothing...

297
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:21,325
...except warped space and time.

298
00:19:22,952 --> 00:19:25,621
It's a place where gravity is so strong...

299
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:29,542
...that if anything falls into the black hole,
it can never get back out.

300
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:32,044
If you fall in,
you can't send signals back out.

301
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:34,338
Light can't get out from the interior.

302
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:38,718
CARROLL: So you might ask,
how would that ever happen?

303
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:43,514
In outer space, you can get so much mass
together, like in a super-massive star...

304
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:46,934
...that the gravity just becomes stronger
and stronger and stronger...

305
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:51,397
...and eventually the pressure
that matter exerts on itself can't keep up.

306
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:54,984
And everything collapses,
there's a big explosion.

307
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:59,113
Some of the stuff is blown away,
but the rest of it collapses into a black hole.

308
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:04,994
NARRATOR: <i>A black hole that spins on its axis</i>
<i>drags the very space around it.</i>..

309
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:09,999
...<i>into a whirling motion</i>
<i>that pulls stars and planets into orbit.</i>

310
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:14,170
<i>Closer in, gravity increases like a riptide.</i>

311
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:18,841
<i>At a boundary called the event horizon,</i>
<i>gravity becomes so extreme.</i>..

312
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:22,386
...<i>that nothing can escape being pulled</i>
<i>into the heart of the beast.</i>..

313
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:23,971
...<i>and lost forever.</i>

314
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:28,434
GHEZ: Black holes are simple,
and yet they have a lot of character.

315
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:30,603
It's almost like
they can take on personalities.

316
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,107
Um, they can be picky eaters, um,
they can be energetic.

317
00:20:35,274 --> 00:20:36,984
And what you're seeing and describing...

318
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:39,987
...is really how the black hole
interacts with the environment.

319
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:43,449
NARRATOR:
<i>UCLA astronomer Andrea Ghez.</i>..

320
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:44,826
Looks like this is Sagi's star.

321
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:46,953
NARRATOR:
...<i>is an expert on black hole detection.</i>

322
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,121
-Must be this one, right?
-I think it's that one.

323
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:53,501
NARRATOR: <i>She played a key role investigating</i>
<i>what had long been a scientific hunch.</i>

324
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:57,088
<i>That a huge black hole
lives at the center of the Milky Way.</i>

325
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:58,422
It's looking good.

326
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:01,217
NARRATOR: <i>Astronomers knew</i>
<i>the heart of our galaxy was buzzing.</i>..

327
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:05,221
...<i>with gas, dust and millions of stars.</i>

328
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:08,724
<i>Some powerful force
appeared to be driving this hubbub.</i>

329
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:11,269
<i>Could it be a black hole?</i>

330
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:15,106
<i>Ground telescopes just couldn</i>'<i>t produce</i>
<i>sharp images of the region.</i>..

331
00:21:16,148 --> 00:21:21,487
...<i>then a technique called adaptive optics</i>
<i>vastly improved the view.</i>

332
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:25,324
This is what it looks like
before you use advanced technology.

333
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:27,076
It's a blurry mess...

334
00:21:27,243 --> 00:21:30,913
...and now you can see the individual stars
with adaptive optics turned on.

335
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,209
So each point of light here
is associated with an individual star.

336
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:41,591
NARRATOR: <i>Andrea put that technique to work</i>
<i>at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii.</i>

337
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,468
GHEZ:
This is a road map.

338
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:48,264
NARRATOR: <i>And she and her team began</i>
<i>to track the stars at the center of the Milky Way.</i>

339
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:50,808
GHEZ:
And that's the center of our galaxy.

340
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:54,145
The very first year that we took the data
was in 1995.

341
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:59,191
Then we go back to the telescope in '96,
then we take our second image...

342
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:01,611
...and you have two pictures,
and you can compare them.

343
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:07,158
NARRATOR: <i>Andrea wanted to see if the stars</i>
<i>were orbiting a single source of gravity.</i>..

344
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:10,286
...<i>but stars can take years</i>
<i>to complete an orbit.</i>

345
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,414
GHEZ: And so it was really important
that we kept going...

346
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:18,336
...and by 2000 we finally started
to see the star's curve.

347
00:22:18,502 --> 00:22:23,132
In other words, the gravitational influence
of the black hole, um...

348
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:27,678
...had made those stars
go from straight lines to starting to bend.

349
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:29,639
Precise enough to see that curvature.

350
00:22:29,805 --> 00:22:34,393
NARRATOR: <i>Year by year,</i>
<i>Andrea and her team built their case.</i>

351
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,648
This animation represents, uh,
20 years of work...

352
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:45,738
...and it tells you that there is a black hole,
and exactly how massive it is.

353
00:22:45,905 --> 00:22:48,991
NARRATOR: <i>Andrea</i>'<i>s painstaking project</i>
<i>revealed a monster.</i>..

354
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:52,411
...<i>with more than 4 million times</i>
<i>the mass of our sun.</i>..

355
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:55,873
...<i>at the center of our Milky Way.</i>

356
00:22:56,499 --> 00:23:00,878
<i>Today, scientists are hunting black holes
with new tools.</i>

357
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:06,300
<i>Caltech astrophysicist Fiona Harrison</i>
<i>scans the skies with NuSTAR.</i>..

358
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:10,012
...<i>a telescope that looks at the universe</i>
<i>in high-energy</i> x-<i>rays.</i>

359
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:13,641
HARRISON:
The black hole itself doesn't emit light...

360
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:16,852
...but dust and gas
falls onto the black holes...

361
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:22,942
...and in doing so, it heats up,
and it emits x-rays.

362
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:28,155
NARRATOR: <i>NuSTAR captures black holes</i>
<i>in the process of feasting on matter.</i>..

363
00:23:28,322 --> 00:23:31,659
...<i>and the telescope is spotting them</i>
<i>all over the place.</i>

364
00:23:32,034 --> 00:23:37,039
HARRISON: It's really only 10, 20 years ago
that we thought black holes were rare.

365
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:40,209
We now know that every galaxy,
like our Milky Way...

366
00:23:40,376 --> 00:23:43,170
...has a massive black hole at its heart.

367
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:48,843
So rather than just being curiosities,
they're actually fundamentally important...

368
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,554
...to why the universe is the way it is.

369
00:23:52,138 --> 00:23:55,641
NARRATOR: <i>So is the Earth at risk</i>
<i>of getting swallowed by a black hole?</i>

370
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:59,395
HARRISON: Even though we have black holes
sprinkled throughout the galaxy...

371
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:01,188
...we're in absolutely no danger.

372
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:05,109
It's a common misconception
that black holes might suck the Earth.

373
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:08,612
Well, there's no sucking going on,
it's just normal gravity.

374
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:11,907
It's just when you get very close to it...

375
00:24:12,074 --> 00:24:15,119
...that there's a region
from which light can't even escape...

376
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:18,122
...and Earth is not gonna do that.

377
00:24:18,998 --> 00:24:20,207
NARRATOR:
<i>But in</i> Interstellar...

378
00:24:20,374 --> 00:24:23,335
...<i>crew members have a precariously close</i>
<i>encounter with a black hole.</i>

379
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:25,463
COOPER:
Oh, we are not prepared for this.

380
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:28,466
NARRATOR:
<i>What would the beast look like to them?</i>

381
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:30,634
One of the things
that Kip was very insistent on...

382
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:34,513
...is that the black hole, it's spherical,
but it's absolutely black.

383
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,307
It has no surface detail.

384
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,268
Doesn't give shadows
or highlights or anything.

385
00:24:39,435 --> 00:24:42,438
But then early on,
we were talking about accretion disks.

386
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:47,860
And that gave us a way
to define the spherical shape of the thing.

387
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:52,406
NARRATOR: <i>A black hole</i>'<i>s accretion disk is</i>
<i>made up of gas and dust and magnetic fields.</i>..

388
00:24:52,573 --> 00:24:53,991
...<i>that spin at high speeds.</i>..

389
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:57,078
...<i>radiating heat and light.</i>

390
00:24:58,454 --> 00:25:02,500
<i>The black hole</i>‘<i>s gravity would actually</i>
<i>bend that light like a camera lens.</i>..

391
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,418
...<i>in ways that Kip would calculate.</i>

392
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:09,882
THORNE: I worked out the equations for tracing
Light rays traveling around the black hole...

393
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:15,513
...to see what the disk would Look Like if you
were in a spacecraft Looking at it up close.

394
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,474
NARRATOR: <i>And Paul's team</i>
<i>brought the mathematics to life.</i>

395
00:25:18,641 --> 00:25:22,394
We were really able to use
a very, very accurate representation...

396
00:25:22,561 --> 00:25:26,774
...of the gravitational lens and the effects
of gravity and Light around the black hole.

397
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:32,321
Uh, because what the algorithms gave us
was extremely spectacular.

398
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,325
NARRATOR:
<i>Even Kip was surprised.</i>

399
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:38,661
You see the disk in front...

400
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,287
...and then when it goes around...

401
00:25:40,454 --> 00:25:44,500
...you see the disk wrap up
around the top of the black hole...

402
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,627
...and wrap around the bottom
of the black hole.

403
00:25:49,797 --> 00:25:52,049
I had guessed
it would Look more or less like this...

404
00:25:52,216 --> 00:25:54,844
...but knowing it intellectually
is different than feeling it...

405
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,263
...than absorbing it, than seeing it.

406
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,723
It just blew me away.

407
00:26:00,474 --> 00:26:02,059
NARRATOR:
<i>But this brilliant depiction.</i>..

408
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:05,646
...<i>still can't tell us what happens</i>
<i>in the heart of a black hole.</i>..

409
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:07,565
...<i>beyond the event horizon.</i>

410
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:14,864
<i>What would happen to an astronaut
daring or crazy enough to dive in feet-first?</i>

411
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,074
THORNE:
In the simplest descriptions of this...

412
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:20,870
...the descriptions that you will find
in most books that you read...

413
00:26:21,036 --> 00:26:22,997
...you're simply stretched
from head to foot...

414
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:28,961
...and squeezed from the side by tidal forces,
"spaghettified" is what it often says.

415
00:26:29,461 --> 00:26:32,756
You're spaghettified as you fall in
and you're destroyed.

416
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:35,050
That's the standard story.

417
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,850
NARRATOR: <i>The truth is,</i>
<i>all the laws of physics that we know.</i>..

418
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:46,270
...<i>break down in the heart of a black hole.</i>

419
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:50,733
<i>Physicists are still working
on exactly what happens there.</i>

420
00:26:52,151 --> 00:26:53,819
That's the gravity well, though, isn't it?

421
00:26:53,986 --> 00:26:59,200
When we talk to non-physicists,
we will often say it's the gravity well.

422
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:01,577
So you've been lying to us all these years.

423
00:27:01,744 --> 00:27:04,914
You know how these things go,
there are lies and there are "lies."

424
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,123
I know, but now....

425
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,837
The movie <i>Interstellar</i> deals with physics
that is well-understood, well-established.

426
00:27:12,004 --> 00:27:15,132
It deals with physics
where we make educated guesses...

427
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,010
...and we're almost sure,
but not 100 percent sure of our guesses.

428
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:22,890
And it deals with physics
at the frontiers of human understanding...

429
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:24,892
...where we have to speculate...

430
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:26,894
...and when you get
beyond those frontiers...

431
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:30,147
...<i>Interstellar</i> works hard to align itself...

432
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:34,109
...with the best speculations
a scientist could imagine.

433
00:27:34,276 --> 00:27:39,365
We're struggling very hard as filmmakers
to try and explain, uh...

434
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:42,993
...these scientific concepts,
these sort of abstract ideas...

435
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,289
...in a subjective way and a way that you can
actually experience and feel something about.

436
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:53,921
NARRATOR: Interstellar <i>mines that gray area</i>
<i>where new ideas percolate.</i>..

437
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:58,968
...<i>and taps deep into questions</i>
<i>about the nature of the universe.</i>

438
00:28:04,473 --> 00:28:08,435
<i>ln</i> Interstellar, <i>telescopes on Earth</i>
<i>first detect the presence of a wormhole.</i>

439
00:28:10,145 --> 00:28:14,942
<i>It shows up as a gravitational anomaly
that distorts the view of space.</i>

440
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:18,862
We made the wormhole
not have all that strong a gravity.

441
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:20,781
But why the wormhole?

442
00:28:21,156 --> 00:28:24,410
Because then you have a reason
for your trip around it.

443
00:28:24,576 --> 00:28:27,454
I feel uncomfortable with the wormhole
having that much gravity.

444
00:28:27,621 --> 00:28:30,374
THORNE: When I first began working
with Christopher Nolan...

445
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:33,335
...he wanted a wormhole
that had rather gentle gravity...

446
00:28:33,502 --> 00:28:35,796
...so we discussed
how big the wormhole should be...

447
00:28:35,963 --> 00:28:39,508
...and agreed that it should be
just barely big enough...

448
00:28:39,675 --> 00:28:41,468
...that it could be seen from Earth...

449
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:44,305
...through the bending of light
around the wormhole...

450
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:46,640
...by the wormhole's warped space.

451
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:50,644
NARRATOR: <i>Kip Thorne worked out just</i>
<i>the right gravity for</i> Interstellar's <i>wormhole.</i>..

452
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:55,441
...<i>using equations based on Einstein</i>‘<i>s theory</i>
<i>of general relativity.</i>

453
00:28:55,607 --> 00:29:01,780
<i>As we</i>‘<i>ve learned, that theory states</i>
<i>that objects warp space-time, creating gravity.</i>

454
00:29:02,614 --> 00:29:06,577
<i>It also predicts that when objects move,</i>
<i>they generate a pulse.</i>..

455
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:10,748
...<i>that propagates through space-time,</i>
<i>a bit like waves through water.</i>

456
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:18,422
<i>These gravitational waves
have never been directly observed.</i>

457
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:21,342
<i>They would be small and hard to detect.</i>..

458
00:29:21,508 --> 00:29:25,888
...<i>unless they were generated</i>
<i>by a massively violent motion.</i>

459
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:30,476
<i>Like the birth of the universe.</i>

460
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:36,523
<i>Physicists developed their big bang theory.</i>..

461
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,612
...<i>in part by observing</i>
<i>that today the universe is expanding.</i>

462
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:48,410
<i>Galaxies are moving away from each other</i>
<i>like raisins in a rising loaf of bread.</i>..

463
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:54,375
...<i>which suggests that in the distant past,</i>
<i>the universe must have been much smaller.</i>

464
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:59,171
CARROLL: If you wind the movie backwards,
in the past, everything was closer together...

465
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:04,301
...and you plug that idea
into the equations that Einstein gives us.

466
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:08,847
And there's a moment, which we now know
was about 14 billion years ago...

467
00:30:09,014 --> 00:30:11,058
...when everything was on top
of everything else...

468
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:15,896
...when the density of stuff in the universe
was apparently infinitely big.

469
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:22,986
NARRATOR: <i>Then a powerful force triggered</i>
<i>an expansion of space itself.</i>

470
00:30:23,153 --> 00:30:28,617
<i>Faster than the speed of light,
a theory called cosmic inflation.</i>

471
00:30:28,784 --> 00:30:34,540
And the theory said that this inflation should've
taken fluctuations in the shape of space...

472
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:37,918
...and amplified them
so they got much stronger.

473
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,463
And they become gravitational waves...

474
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,551
...producing ripples
in the fabric of space and time.

475
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:48,929
NARRATOR:
<i>If we could detect those ripples today.</i>..

476
00:30:49,096 --> 00:30:52,266
...<i>it would help us understand</i>
<i>how the big bang banged.</i>

477
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,144
BOCK: The trick was always
how were we going to measure such a thing.

478
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,187
And that led us to propose and develop...

479
00:30:57,354 --> 00:31:00,232
...this very specialized experiment, um...

480
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,070
...which one of my colleagues
referred to gleefully as a wild-goose chase.

481
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,826
NARRATOR: <i>Caltech physicist Jamie Bock</i>
<i>works in experimental cosmology.</i>

482
00:31:10,993 --> 00:31:14,329
BOCK: Experimental cosmology
is building experiments...

483
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:16,790
...trying to get back to the dawn of time.

484
00:31:16,957 --> 00:31:18,000
You need a hand with that?

485
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,002
NARRATOR:
<i>The focus of his latest experiment.</i>..

486
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,920
...<i>was the oldest light in the universe.</i>

487
00:31:22,254 --> 00:31:26,133
<i>The faint afterglow of the big bang.</i>

488
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,220
<i>Physicists have mapped</i>
<i>this cosmic microwave background.</i>..

489
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:32,598
...<i>across the universe.</i>

490
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,519
<i>If the birth of the universe</i>
<i>produced gravitational waves.</i>..

491
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:39,521
...<i>they would've warped</i>
<i>this primordial light.</i>..

492
00:31:39,688 --> 00:31:44,276
...<i>and caused it to be polarized</i>
<i>or curled in a specific direction.</i>

493
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:46,236
BOCK:
If one could measure the polarization...

494
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:48,947
...and then not only measure it
but Look at its pattern...

495
00:31:49,114 --> 00:31:51,283
...there might be kind of a swirly pattern...

496
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:54,536
...that would be an indicator
of gravitational waves.

497
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,584
NARRATOR: <i>Jamie and his team designed</i>
<i>a series of small super-sensitive telescopes.</i>..

498
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,796
...<i>that they installed</i>
<i>where the skies are crystal clear.</i>

499
00:32:04,963 --> 00:32:06,965
<i>At the South Pole.</i>

500
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:10,302
BOCK: The South Pole
is the closest we can get to outer space...

501
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:11,803
...to make our measurements.

502
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:18,060
NARRATOR: <i>For eight years, the team</i>‘<i>s</i>
<i>telescopes scanned a patch in the sky.</i>..

503
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,687
...<i>measuring minute differences</i>
<i>in the temperature.</i>..

504
00:32:20,854 --> 00:32:23,190
...<i>of the cosmic microwave background.</i>..

505
00:32:23,357 --> 00:32:25,025
...<i>and a pattern emerged.</i>

506
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:30,531
BOCK: Our results reported that we see
this swirly pattern of polarization...

507
00:32:30,697 --> 00:32:34,993
...that's consistent with, uh,
what you expect from gravitational waves.

508
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:39,498
THORNE: So they didn't really see the
gravitational waves from the early universe...

509
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:43,502
...but they saw this polarization pattern
that was precisely what was predicted...

510
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:46,171
...except that it was stronger than expected.

511
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:49,758
Tells us what went on
immediately after the big bang...

512
00:32:49,925 --> 00:32:54,263
...when the universe was a trillionth
of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.

513
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:57,641
So it's seeing almost
the creation of the universe.

514
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:02,604
NARRATOR: <i>The finding must be confirmed</i>
<i>by other experiments.</i>

515
00:33:02,771 --> 00:33:07,109
<i>If it holds up, this first evidence</i>
<i>for the detection of gravitational waves.</i>..

516
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:11,321
...<i>will deepen our understanding</i>
<i>of the birth of the universe.</i>

517
00:33:12,864 --> 00:33:18,620
<i>And that, by extension,
may help us answer an enduring question:</i>

518
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:20,956
<i>Can we time travel?</i>

519
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:23,417
CARROLL:
You know, it's very easy to travel in time.

520
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,628
Yesterday, I've moved forward 24 hours
and here I am.

521
00:33:26,795 --> 00:33:30,173
But that's the only way that it's easy.
It's easy to go into the future.

522
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:34,595
In fact, it's not just easy, it's inevitable.
We all move into the future over time.

523
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:38,974
NARRATOR:
<i>But traveling to the past is a different story.</i>..

524
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:43,020
...<i>because space and time</i>
<i>have profoundly different properties.</i>

525
00:33:43,562 --> 00:33:46,815
In space, you can go up, down,
left, right, forward, backward.

526
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,112
NARRATOR: <i>We move freely</i>
<i>through the three dimensions of space.</i>

527
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:57,034
<i>ln time, we experience its one dimension
and a lot less freedom.</i>

528
00:33:57,576 --> 00:34:00,287
CARROLL: Because time has a direction
and space does not.

529
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:02,289
In time, there's a huge difference...

530
00:34:02,456 --> 00:34:05,626
...between one direction, the future,
and the other direction, the past.

531
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:09,838
For example, you remember the past,
but you don't remember the future.

532
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:12,549
You were younger in the past,
we were all younger in the past.

533
00:34:12,716 --> 00:34:15,302
We will all be older. It's all universal to us.

534
00:34:17,971 --> 00:34:21,433
This arrow of time is a little bit mysterious.

535
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,602
We understand the basic underpinnings...

536
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:27,397
...in a concept called entropy,
the disorderliness of the universe.

537
00:34:28,982 --> 00:34:32,569
NARRATOR: <i>Entropy is the measure</i>
<i>of the disorder in a system.</i>

538
00:34:32,736 --> 00:34:36,114
<i>The more ordered a system,
the lower its entropy.</i>

539
00:34:38,533 --> 00:34:42,287
<i>The more disordered a system,
the higher its entropy.</i>

540
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:47,042
A classic example of entropy increasing
is just mixing cream into coffee.

541
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:50,128
When the cream and the coffee are separate,
that's low entropy.

542
00:34:50,295 --> 00:34:52,381
They're organized.
There's the cream, the coffee.

543
00:34:52,547 --> 00:34:55,258
You pour them together,
you let them mix together.

544
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:58,428
Entropy just goes up.
Things become more and more disorderly.

545
00:35:02,557 --> 00:35:06,228
And this goes all the way back 14 billion years
to the big bang.

546
00:35:07,437 --> 00:35:11,608
NARRATOR: <i>Back then, all the matter in</i>
<i>the universe would have been on top of itself.</i>

547
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:14,736
<i>Density would have been infinite.</i>

548
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:18,031
<i>lt was the epitome of low entropy.</i>

549
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:24,246
<i>But entropy has been on the rise
ever since the big bang.</i>

550
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:27,124
CARROLL: We think, but we haven't
absolutely established...

551
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:31,002
...that this general tendency
to go from order to disorder...

552
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:35,298
...is the single reason
why the past is different from the future.

553
00:35:35,465 --> 00:35:39,720
We can't discount in principle
the possibility of visiting the past...

554
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:43,974
...but all of these weird puzzles
that sort of rub us the wrong way...

555
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:47,936
...about if I go back into the past
and I give myself a really good idea...

556
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:51,565
...and then I grow up and become rich off
that idea, where did the idea come from?

557
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:54,234
These kinds of puzzles would evaporate...

558
00:35:54,401 --> 00:35:57,988
...if we just said, "Well, the laws of physics
don't allow you to visit the past."

559
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:00,365
So that's probably true.

560
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:05,829
NARRATOR: <i>To contemplate the mysteries</i>
<i>of space, time and the universe.</i>..

561
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:08,623
...<i>can make a person feel mighty small.</i>

562
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:13,420
<i>Maybe it's best to lower our sights,
hunker down and focus on planet Earth.</i>

563
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:18,091
<i>But that's not really an option for humanity
in the long run.</i>

564
00:36:21,636 --> 00:36:25,390
Interstellar <i>depicts a future</i>
<i>where living conditions on Earth are grim.</i>

565
00:36:25,557 --> 00:36:30,312
Our mission does not work if the people
on Earth are dead by the time we pull it off.

NARRATOR:

567
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:35,525
<i>Clouds of dust.</i>

568
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,571
<i>Roads clogged with refugees.</i>

569
00:36:39,738 --> 00:36:41,281
<i>Sound familiar?</i>

570
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:47,370
<i>That's because we</i>‘<i>ve lived</i>
<i>through this scenario before.</i>

571
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:51,666
<i>ln the 1930s, the Great Plains
were hit by extreme drought.</i>

572
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:55,545
<i>Farmers had plowed up native grasslands.</i>

573
00:36:55,712 --> 00:37:01,092
<i>When crops failed, unprotected topsoil billowed
into clouds that darkened the sky for days.</i>

574
00:37:03,595 --> 00:37:07,933
<i>Some 400,000 people lost nearly everything
during the dust bowl.</i>

575
00:37:08,266 --> 00:37:12,604
<i>One of America</i>‘<i>s</i>
<i>worst man-made ecological disasters.</i>

576
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:19,986
<i>It was the model</i>
<i>for the calamity depicted in</i> Interstellar.

577
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:24,699
NOLAN: I really wanted to try
and bring the audiences' attention...

578
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:28,119
...to the idea that this
sort of thing really can happen.

579
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:32,541
And it struck me
that the imagery that you can find...

580
00:37:32,707 --> 00:37:36,086
...was so much more extraordinary than
anything you see in a science fiction film.

581
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:39,965
And, indeed, in our portrayal of it,
we had to frankly water it down.

582
00:37:40,715 --> 00:37:43,927
NARRATOR: <i>But we</i>‘<i>d never let a dust bowl</i>
<i>happen again, would we ?</i>

583
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:52,519
<i>ln recent years, cities in the</i>
<i>American Southwest, especially Texas.</i>..

584
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:55,438
...<i>have been battered by huge dust storms.</i>

585
00:37:55,897 --> 00:38:00,193
<i>They've caused fatal traffic accidents
and damaged infrastructure.</i>

586
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,990
<i>The causes are frighteningly familiar</i>
<i>to UCLA geographer Greg Okin.</i>..

587
00:38:05,156 --> 00:38:08,618
...<i>an expert on the dynamics</i>
<i>of wind and dust.</i>

588
00:38:09,327 --> 00:38:10,912
OKIN:
We have wind-erodible soil.

589
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:13,915
We have agriculture
that's disturbed the native vegetation.

590
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:17,627
We have bare ground because crops fail.

591
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:19,504
And we have windy conditions.

592
00:38:19,671 --> 00:38:24,676
So all of the same things that happened
in the dust bowl are happening now.

593
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:30,056
NARRATOR: <i>Models of climate change</i>
<i>predict higher global temperatures.</i>

594
00:38:30,223 --> 00:38:32,767
<i>That probably means more droughts.</i>

595
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:36,605
<i>Economic pressures may lead
to increased farming of wildlands.</i>

596
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:42,819
<i>If crops fail due to drought,
that could mean more dust.</i>

597
00:38:43,194 --> 00:38:44,988
OKIN:
It could happen in China.

598
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:46,698
It could happen in Africa.

599
00:38:46,865 --> 00:38:51,494
Any of these factors, when they're in place,
could cause what we have called the dust bowl.

600
00:38:52,787 --> 00:38:54,456
NARRATOR:
<i>And to make matters worse.</i>..

601
00:38:55,123 --> 00:38:59,419
...<i>dust is much dirtier today</i>
<i>than it was in the 1930s.</i>

602
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:04,299
OKIN: The dust that is interacting
with clouds of pollution from cities...

603
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:06,927
...in urban and industrial activities, um...

604
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:12,140
...that actually does appear
to also be more noxious than regular dust.

605
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:17,646
NARRATOR: <i>Winds blow dust across oceans</i>
<i>and continents and into our lungs.</i>

606
00:39:17,812 --> 00:39:21,524
Dust, particularly for kids with asthma,
is a really big problem.

607
00:39:21,691 --> 00:39:23,610
There's actually quite good evidence...

608
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:28,865
...for dust being correlated
with pediatric hospital admissions.

609
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:31,451
That's where the really clear evidence is.

610
00:39:32,744 --> 00:39:35,997
NARRATOR:
<i>No one predicted the dust bowl of the 1930s.</i>

611
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:38,249
<i>Today, we should know better.</i>

612
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:42,045
OKIN: We learned the important lesson
that poorly-planned human activity...

613
00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:47,384
...plus unexpected climate variability
can lead to disaster.

614
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,636
There's a lot to worry about.

615
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:54,724
NARRATOR: <i>Sadly, we don</i>‘<i>t have a great</i>

00:39:56,309 --> 00:40:01,439

620
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:22,293
...<i>and when it explodes in midair,</i>

<i>Asteroids have struck Earth before.</i>

00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:53,533
<i>A similar impact, or worse,</i>

00:41:01,082 --> 00:41:04,044
<i>Earth cannot sustain us forever.</i>

632
00:41:04,836 --> 00:41:09,049
<i>ln a few billion years,</i>

Six, five, four, three, two, one.

Zero.

642
00:41:40,413 --> 00:41:44,292
Zero and liftoff of space shuttle <i>Atlantis.</i>

643
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:47,796
NARRATOR: <i>Today, nearly 600 people</i>
<i>have traveled to space.</i>

644
00:41:49,631 --> 00:41:54,427
<i>During the shuttle era,
Marsha Ivins made the trip five times.</i>

<i>ln order to record all of this, um, we have
created this, uh, wiring nightmare here.</i>

NARRATOR: <i>At Kennedy Space Center Visitor</i>
<i>Complex, she checks in on an old friend.</i>

647
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:11,903
IVINS: I look at <i>Atlantis</i> hanging here,
it's a surreal kind of experience to think...

648
00:42:12,612 --> 00:42:14,572
...I flew that into space.

649
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:17,200
It's still something
that I have a hard time believing.

-Hi.
-My name is Tanya.

PHOTOGRAPHER:
One, two, three.

652
00:42:20,245 --> 00:42:24,082
And it makes me feel good
that people still have a wonder...

653
00:42:24,249 --> 00:42:27,877
...and an amazement and a pure joy...

654
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:32,048
...for the fact that we did fly this vehicle
into space.

655
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:37,428
NARRATOR: <i>For Marsha,</i>
<i>each mission was as breathtaking as her first.</i>

656
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:39,681
IVINS:
I looked up overhead...

657
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:46,062
...and here was this black sky
and this blue Earth.

658
00:42:46,229 --> 00:42:50,733
All hits you at that point,
"I am not on the planet anymore."

659
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:54,988
And every astronaut who has flown
has come back and said the same thing.

660
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,906
As you circle the Earth...

661
00:42:57,073 --> 00:43:02,787
...you do not see natural borders
and boundaries that separate the countries.

662
00:43:02,954 --> 00:43:08,168
And all of the wars and the angst
and the strife that tear this planet apart...

663
00:43:08,334 --> 00:43:11,212
...seem so insignificant from that view.

664
00:43:12,505 --> 00:43:13,715
NOLAN:
To me...

665
00:43:14,257 --> 00:43:19,929
...space travel, space exploration
has always represented the ultimate frontier.

666
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:23,975
It's of the absolute extremities
of what human experience is...

667
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:28,313
...and it's all about trying to, in some way,
define our place in the universe.

668
00:43:28,479 --> 00:43:32,150
MAN: Forty seconds away
from the <i>Apollo 1 1</i> liftoff.

669
00:43:32,317 --> 00:43:33,985
JONATHAN:
I remember growing up as a kid...

670
00:43:34,152 --> 00:43:38,031
...and we were both fascinated
by this impulse to flight.

671
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:44,370
This impulse to build unimaginable machines
and use them to blast off into space.

672
00:43:45,371 --> 00:43:51,169
MAN: Having fired the imagination of
a generation, pulls into port for the last time.

673

NARRATOR:
<i>The space shuttles were retired in 2011.</i>..

674
00:43:54,255 --> 00:43:57,592
...<i>after traveling more than</i>
<i>a half billion miles.</i>

675
00:44:00,011 --> 00:44:03,223
<i>Space exploration demands
enormous resources.</i>

676
00:44:03,389 --> 00:44:06,684
<i>The kind that government agencies
like NASA can marshal.</i>

677
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,730
<i>Recently, some new players entered the fray.</i>

678
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:14,943
M USK: I do think we're at the dawn
of a new space era...

679
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:17,695
...and it's one where commercial companies
play a stronger role.

680
00:44:17,862 --> 00:44:19,405
NASA's not out of the picture.

681
00:44:19,572 --> 00:44:25,286
They're very much in the picture,
but it's not all a NASA-designed system.

682
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:31,167
NARRATOR: <i>ln</i> 2002, <i>Elon Musk started</i>
<i>his own rocket company.</i>

683
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:34,379
<i>A decade later, under contract to NASA.</i>..

684
00:44:34,545 --> 00:44:38,591
...<i>SpaceX became the first private company</i>
<i>in history to carry supplies.</i>..

...<i>to and from</i>
<i>the International Space Station.</i>

686
00:44:45,056 --> 00:44:48,768
<i>Now SpaceX is tackling
an even greater challenge.</i>

687
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:53,481
MUSK: I started SpaceX with the idea
of trying to revolutionize space transport.

688
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:58,069
And critical to that
is full and rapid reusability of the rocket.

689
00:44:59,404 --> 00:45:02,782
The big issue with rocketry today
is you get one use out of the rocket...

690
00:45:02,949 --> 00:45:07,578
...and then it smashes down into the ocean
or into the plains of Siberia, um...

691
00:45:07,745 --> 00:45:09,455
...and you can't use it again.

692
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,876
If you can, in fact, land the rocket safely...

693
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:16,671
...and then reuse it
with a minimal amount of effort...

694
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:22,385
...then you can dramatically
reduce the cost of space transport.

695
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:27,765
NARRATOR: <i>SpaceX is currently developing</i>
<i>a fully and rapidly reusable launch system.</i>

696
00:45:27,932 --> 00:45:30,727
<i>And that will take Elon closer
to a more ambitious goal:</i>

<i>Not a mission for the fainthearted.</i>

699
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,155
MUSK:
Anyone who wants to go to Mars...

700
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:47,952
...their desire for adventure would have to
overcome their desire for comfort and safety.

701
00:45:48,953 --> 00:45:53,416
NARRATOR: <i>The colony on Mars</i>
<i>could be the next giant leap for humankind.</i>

702
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:56,711
NOLAN: It's such a fundamental idea
when you think about it.

703
00:45:56,878 --> 00:46:00,548
It's just a decision that has to be made
in terms of how you view the--

704
00:46:00,715 --> 00:46:02,967
The human race's place in the universe.

705

We either stay here on Earth or we leave
and we journey through the galaxy.

We wanted to approach it
from a more functional point of view...

710
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:28,993
...just be as convincing as possible...

711
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,788
...Looking at the NASA technology
that exists today...

712
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:34,999
...the International Space Station,
these kind of things as our influences.

713
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:40,338
NARRATOR: <i>There</i>‘<i>s no telling how space</i>
<i>technology will evolve in the years to come.</i>

714
00:46:41,297 --> 00:46:46,511
<i>We may be decades away or longer</i>
<i>from establishing a colony on Mars.</i>..

715
00:46:47,011 --> 00:46:50,264
...<i>or a permanent habitat</i>
<i>in orbit around the Earth.</i>

716
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:53,643
<i>But people around the world
are dreaming of that next step.</i>

717
00:46:56,312 --> 00:46:58,981
<i>At a recent space conference.</i>..

718
00:46:59,148 --> 00:47:01,150
...<i>NASA and the National Space Society.</i>..

719
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:05,446
...<i>handed out awards</i>
<i>to dozens of forward-looking designs.</i>

720
00:47:07,865 --> 00:47:11,077
<i>A self-sustaining settlement</i>
<i>for</i> 20,<i>000 people.</i>

721
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:16,541
<i>A moon base that mines minerals
from lunar soil.</i>

722
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:20,461
<i>A fleet of robots that clean up space junk.</i>

723
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:23,089
But, of course, this is hard
because we're burning fuel....

724
00:47:23,256 --> 00:47:26,634
NARRATOR: <i>There</i>‘<i>s not a single PhD</i>
<i>among the prize-winning designers.</i>

[SINGING IN SPANISH]

726
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:33,558
NARRATOR: <i>These are middle and high school</i>
<i>students from around the world.</i>

727
00:47:33,724 --> 00:47:39,355
What first inspired me was the sky,
the stars, the moon, the planets.

728
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:44,610
Thinking about going to space
is really exhilarating.

729
00:47:44,777 --> 00:47:48,906
I've always wanted to know, like, what's next?
And for me, space is next.

730
00:47:49,073 --> 00:47:51,325
What we can do is beyond our imagination.

731
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:57,790
For the survival of the human race,
really, the only option is to go into space.

732
00:47:57,957 --> 00:48:01,669
It should be something that--
A first step we should take as a world.

733
00:48:01,836 --> 00:48:05,214
NARRATOR: <i>One of these kids</i>
<i>may stand on Mars someday.</i>..

734
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:07,592
...<i>or make a breakthrough</i>
<i>in propulsion systems.</i>..

735
00:48:08,092 --> 00:48:10,636
...<i>or start a revolution in astrophysics.</i>

736
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:16,100
<i>To inspire their kind of enthusiasm</i>
<i>is the hope of the</i> Interstellar <i>team.</i>

737
00:48:16,642 --> 00:48:19,103
THOMAS:
I would love for kids to watch <i>Interstellar.</i>..

738
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:23,399
...and get excited about possibilities
of space travel and exploration.

739
00:48:23,733 --> 00:48:29,030
I would hope that this film
introduces many people to science...

740
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:32,950
...who might not have gotten curious
about this kind of science in any other way.

741
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:36,787
I think it would be really thrilling
if people got some sense from this film...

742
00:48:36,954 --> 00:48:39,582
...that, uh, these ideas
are worth thinking about.

743
00:48:42,293 --> 00:48:45,046
NARRATOR: <i>The interplay between science</i>
<i>and science fiction.</i>..

744
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,840
...<i>springs from a</i>
<i>deep-seated creative drive.</i>

745
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:52,678
<i>To make sense of the unknown.</i>

746
00:49:01,187 --> 00:49:02,772
<i>To engineer new worlds.</i>

747
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,612
<i>To dream up a better future.</i>

748

<i>We</i> '<i>ll find answers where we always have:</i>
