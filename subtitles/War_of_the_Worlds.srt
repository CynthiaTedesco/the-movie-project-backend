1
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:28,281
No one would have believed
in the early years of the 21st century

2
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:35,455
that our world was being watched
by intelligences greater than our own.

3
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:42,378
That as men busied themselves
about their various concerns,

4
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:46,507
they observed and studied

5
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:52,138
the way a man with a microscope
might scrutinize the creatures

6
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:56,184
that swarm and multiply
in a drop of water.

7
00:01:58,062 --> 00:02:03,316
With infinite complacency,
men went to and fro about the globe,

8
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:08,404
confident of our empire over this world.

9
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:13,785
Yet, across the gulf of space,

10
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:18,748
intellects vast and cool
and unsympathetic

11
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:23,336
regarded our planet with envious eyes

12
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,507
and slowly and surely

13
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:31,177
drew their plans against us.

14
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:27,817
Tell him to send it over
to the cargo shed.

15
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:29,944
It's on its way.

16
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,083
Ray.

17
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:46,502
Ferrier. Whoa.

18
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:50,631
I need you back in four instead of 12.
I got half of Korea coming in at noon.

19
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:53,968
No, no, no, I can't.
I'm on a 12-hour blow. Call Tedesco.

20
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:57,430
Come on. Tedesco can't move
40 containers in an hour.

21
00:03:57,514 --> 00:03:59,724
I got to have somebody
who can do double picks.

22
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,352
I wish I could help you, Sal.
It's the goddamn union regulations.

23
00:04:03,437 --> 00:04:05,730
Come on. I'm in a position here, Ray.

24
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:09,233
You remember
the union regulations, Sal.

25
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:11,444
You know what your problem is?

26
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:15,114
I can think of a couple women
who'd be happy to tell you.

27
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:40,139
8:30? Did we say that?

28
00:04:40,224 --> 00:04:42,183
We said 8:00.

29
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:46,312
Hey, this is...

30
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:49,565
This is one safe-looking new vehicle
you got yourself here, Tim.

31
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,026
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

32
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,113
8:00?

33
00:04:57,533 --> 00:05:00,743
We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,
depending on the traffic.

34
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:04,747
There he is.

35
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:08,834
Get a hug?

36
00:05:10,212 --> 00:05:13,381
Confusing handshake?
Kick in the teeth?

37
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:15,508
The door's locked.

38
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:17,843
Still working on those manners?

39
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,514
Hello, Dad.

40
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:24,141
Hello, Rachel.

41
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:30,606
Yo, Stan, hurry up.
We got to get to work.

42
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:39,949
Here, honey. Let me
give you a hand getting that inside.

43
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,867
- The door's locked.
- Sweetheart, let me get it.

44
00:05:41,952 --> 00:05:45,371
- I don't mind. I don't mind.
- Hey, she said she could get it.

45
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:46,831
- It's heavy.
- She said she could get it.

46
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:48,791
It's got rollers. Just roll it, roll it.

47
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,460
Yeah, but we can't roll it
up the stairs, can we?

48
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:53,921
Really, I got it from here, okay?

49
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:02,138
It's a 302 V8. It's...

50
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,182
It's gonna be out of here next week.

51
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:10,021
You better get going, you wanna
beat the traffic, don't you think?

52
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,149
You're out of milk.

53
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:15,401
And everything else.

54
00:06:16,153 --> 00:06:18,237
Yeah.
Could you close the door, please?

55
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:21,073
Because that's my refrigerator.

56
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:23,909
I'm gonna go wait outside.

57
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:28,914
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll see you in a few days.

58
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,958
Bye, Tim.

59
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,087
- I better get this upstairs.
- Let me... Let me get...

60
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:37,423
- Mom, Mom, Mom.
- Mary Ann...

61
00:06:37,507 --> 00:06:40,217
- Okay, okay.
- Mom, Mom.

62
00:06:52,648 --> 00:06:54,523
A little old to still be sharing,
aren't they?

63
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:57,860
- I don't hear any complaints.
- No, I do.

64
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,245
Robbie's got a paper on the French
occupation ofAlgeria due Monday,

65
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,206
which he's yet to begin.

66
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,500
It would be nice if he were done
by the time we got back

67
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:15,461
so we don't have to keep
him up all night on Sunday.

68
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:17,296
- I just gotta type it up.
- No.

69
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:21,050
- You just got to start writing it first.
- I love you, Mom.

70
00:07:21,134 --> 00:07:22,843
I love you.

71
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:26,305
Listen to your father.

72
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:29,892
No shoes on the bed.

73
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:33,229
We'll be at my parents' house
in Boston,

74
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:35,314
but don't call the house line,
you know, they...

75
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,899
Well, the point is,
I've got my cell phone,

76
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:39,819
so if anything comes up
or you have any questions, just call me.

77
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:41,821
Believe it or not, I can handle it.

78
00:07:41,905 --> 00:07:44,448
- I'll leave the phone on.
- Mary Ann.

79
00:07:45,742 --> 00:07:47,743
It's a good look for you.

80
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:51,288
You think?

81
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,208
Yeah.

82
00:07:56,253 --> 00:07:58,421
Take care of our kids.

83
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:01,173
Mary Ann,
you got nothing to worry about.

84
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:05,428
Listen, you tell your mom that
Ray sends his love and kisses.

85
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:10,057
Right. She'll love that.

86
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:21,360
The Ukraine,
a country of some 52 million people,

87
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:23,529
is in almost total blackness tonight

88
00:08:23,613 --> 00:08:25,948
in the wake of a series
of freakish lightning storms

89
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:27,825
of catastrophic proportion,

90
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:30,745
which struck the country at
approximately 4:00 a.m. local time.

91
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:37,543
...EMP, or electromagnetic pulse,
which causes a temporary interruption

92
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:40,337
of all electrical current within its field.

93
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:43,758
As in the Ukraine, there are
scattered reports that the EMP here

94
00:08:43,842 --> 00:08:47,261
was followed by seismic activity
on the scale of an earthquake,

95
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:50,556
measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale.
This...

96
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:58,147
- Baseball season's over.
- Five minutes. It's not gonna kill you.

97
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:01,650
There he is.

98
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,865
Boston?

99
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:11,076
That's how it is?

100
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,581
Is that how it's gonna be?

101
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,753
- Careful with that throw.
- Whatever, Ray.

102
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:22,838
Mom says you got
a report due on Monday,

103
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:24,882
so you're gonna work on that
when we're done here.

104
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:27,593
Yeah, I'm almost finished.
I just got to type it up.

105
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:29,345
Yeah, bullshit.

106
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:33,432
Yeah? What do you know, Ray?

107
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,519
Everything. Haven't you heard?
Between me and my brother,

108
00:09:36,603 --> 00:09:38,395
we know everything.

109
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:42,149
What's the capital ofAustralia?

110
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:44,610
That's one my brother knows.

111
00:09:46,696 --> 00:09:50,533
Okay with you if I just laugh the first
500 times you tell that one?

112
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:54,411
Just do your report.

113
00:09:54,496 --> 00:09:57,289
We don't send you to school
so you can flunk out.

114
00:09:57,624 --> 00:10:00,042
You don't pay for it, Tim does.

115
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:07,883
That's half what I've got.

116
00:10:07,968 --> 00:10:10,886
You're an asshole. I hate coming here.

117
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:13,055
That why you act like such a dick?

118
00:10:29,197 --> 00:10:30,489
What?

119
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:33,659
That's not how you're gonna
get through to him.

120
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:38,080
- If you want him to listen to you...
- What are you, your mother or mine?

121
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,167
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to sleep.

122
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:44,044
I work for a living.

123
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,757
- What are we supposed to eat?
- You know, order.

124
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:15,951
Three and two...

125
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,121
- Electromagnetic storm...
- The storms were tracked...

126
00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:23,584
And I'll have my own little secret.
Good idea, hey, Gary?

127
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:25,961
- No.
- What do you know?

128
00:11:26,046 --> 00:11:27,796
You're a snail.

129
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,099
What's the matter?

130
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:40,851
Got a splinter.

131
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:45,856
Where'd you get it? Come here.

132
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:47,691
On your porch railing.

133
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:51,487
Do you need me to... What?
To do what? You want me to...

134
00:11:53,114 --> 00:11:55,991
- You want me to take that out?
- Absolutely not.

135
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:59,495
Come here. Let me see it. Let me see.

136
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:00,996
Dad.

137
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:02,998
- Just look. Don't touch it. Dad.
- Rach.

138
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:07,002
- I can't. You're moving it around.
- Okay, but don't touch it. Just look at it.

139
00:12:08,004 --> 00:12:09,588
It's gonna get infected.

140
00:12:09,673 --> 00:12:11,423
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it's gonna get infected.

141
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:13,425
No, it won't.

142
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,179
When it's ready,
my body will just push it out.

143
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:20,516
- Push it out, huh?
- I read that.

144
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:25,729
You should get TiVo.

145
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:28,440
- Tim got it for my room.
- TiVo?

146
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:29,942
It's awesome.

147
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,570
I can watch all my shows
after homework.

148
00:12:35,031 --> 00:12:37,574
Yeah, I'll just put it on my platinum card.

149
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:40,119
Robbie? Robbie.

150
00:12:44,874 --> 00:12:46,625
What is that?

151
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:49,461
Hummus.

152
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:53,173
- Hummus?
- From the health-food place.

153
00:12:53,258 --> 00:12:55,634
Kept one of their menus
last time we were here.

154
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:00,889
You said order.

155
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:03,726
I meant order food.

156
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:06,437
Where is Robbie?

157
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,981
- He went out.
- Out where?

158
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:12,484
I don't know.
He just took your car and left.

159
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,029
Who said that? Who's there?

160
00:13:15,113 --> 00:13:16,947
It's the clam burglar.

161
00:13:44,893 --> 00:13:46,268
Steven, look at this.

162
00:13:46,352 --> 00:13:48,771
- What's up?
- Check it out!

163
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,110
You ever see something like that?

164
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:57,821
Springtime, maybe.
Not this time of year.

165
00:13:57,906 --> 00:14:01,116
Come on, we can see better
from the back yard.

166
00:14:22,722 --> 00:14:24,890
You got to come see this!

167
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:38,821
- That is so weird.
- What?

168
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:41,740
The wind is blowing toward the storm.

169
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:43,951
That is weird.

170
00:14:44,035 --> 00:14:45,911
Hey, watch it!

171
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:50,374
Rachel, you wanna see something cool?

172
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:25,784
It's okay.

173
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:28,078
- I wanna go inside.
- It's okay.

174
00:15:28,163 --> 00:15:29,997
I wanna go inside.

175
00:15:30,665 --> 00:15:32,374
Okay, you go ahead.

176
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:36,712
That's enough weather for me.

177
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:39,423
Don't wanna go by myself.

178
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:46,889
- It's kind of fun, isn't it?
- No.

179
00:15:46,973 --> 00:15:49,975
- Come on, like the Fourth of July.
- No, it's not.

180
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:51,852
Oh, say can...

181
00:16:02,572 --> 00:16:04,406
It's okay. You're fine.

182
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,034
- It hit right behind our house.
- Yeah, well, it's...

183
00:16:07,118 --> 00:16:08,827
It's not gonna hit there again, okay,

184
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:11,663
because lightning doesn't strike
twice in the same place.

185
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:12,998
Shit!

186
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:20,255
Where's Robbie?

187
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:23,258
I don't know.

188
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:26,595
Is Robbie okay?

189
00:16:28,765 --> 00:16:30,682
Are you okay?

190
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:32,726
Where's the thunder?

191
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:34,937
Why won't it stop?

192
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:50,744
Is it over?

193
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:07,427
Where are you going?

194
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:11,640
Just... I'm just checking things out.
Just wait. Wait there.

195
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:14,434
- Are we gonna be okay?
- I don't know.

196
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,687
- You don't know?
- No, I meant, I just...

197
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:18,522
Rachel, please.

198
00:17:18,606 --> 00:17:21,984
Just stop asking so many questions.
Just wait here.

199
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:02,149
Turn everything off.

200
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:04,067
Everything is off.

201
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:07,529
I can't get one freaking thing to turn on.

202
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:12,492
You believe this, Ray? Every single car.

203
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:16,413
Jesus. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

204
00:18:16,497 --> 00:18:18,206
- The car just stopped, and...
- You're okay?

205
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,042
- Are you okay? You all right?
- The lightning started to hit

206
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:21,460
about a block away,
over and over again.

207
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:23,587
- And me and this other guy...
- Where the hell did you go?

208
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:26,256
- Over on Lincoln Avenue.
- Lincoln Avenue?

209
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:27,632
- By the church.
- You see it? You saw the lightning?

210
00:18:27,717 --> 00:18:29,259
- Were you near it?
- Yeah, 26 times we counted,

211
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:30,344
over and over again.

212
00:18:30,428 --> 00:18:32,971
The lightning started to hit.
It opened up this hole or something...

213
00:18:33,056 --> 00:18:34,056
- I don't know.
- Twenty-six times?

214
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,599
- Yeah.
- Okay.

215
00:18:36,392 --> 00:18:37,809
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

216
00:18:37,894 --> 00:18:39,936
Good. All right, well,
your sister is in the house,

217
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:43,357
and I want you to go in that house
and I want you to stay with her, okay?

218
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:47,569
The next time you take my car with
no driver's license and no permission,

219
00:18:47,653 --> 00:18:49,237
I call the cops.

220
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:53,408
You better be there when I get back.

221
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:56,328
- Yeah.
- Robbie.

222
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,503
Manny, Manny. Manny, what is it, dead?

223
00:19:04,587 --> 00:19:07,255
All of them. Everything. Look at this.

224
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,591
- The starter's fried.
- Lightning hit it?

225
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:12,135
Not even close.
I thought if I changed it...

226
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,679
- You got any idea what's going on?
- I'm on my way to find out.

227
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:16,890
Try changing the solenoid.
It's probably fried.

228
00:19:16,974 --> 00:19:19,434
Right, that's what I said.
I told you that. The solenoid.

229
00:19:20,144 --> 00:19:24,898
Hey, they're saying all the lightning
struck down by the church.

230
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:37,786
What the hell is going on around here?

231
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:40,664
- Let us through.
- Hey.

232
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:42,040
- Let us through here.
- Hey, hey.

233
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,959
What up, Ray?

234
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:45,752
I should've known
you two were behind this.

235
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:47,838
Hey, God's pissed off
at the neighborhood, Raymond.

236
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:48,922
- I'll tell you that much.
- Can you blame him?

237
00:19:49,006 --> 00:19:50,006
- You see it?
- Yeah.

238
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:52,509
- You got power where you are?
- Nope. Nothing.

239
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,052
It's the cars, though.
You know, that's the thing.

240
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:56,221
Solar flare.
That's what this guy told me he heard.

241
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:57,889
- A solar flare?
- Yeah, he says the sun shoots off

242
00:19:57,974 --> 00:19:59,433
- these big blobs of plasma.
- Let me tell you something.

243
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:02,060
They turn into solar flares.
It's the only thing that can kill

244
00:20:02,145 --> 00:20:04,229
- all the electronic stuff like that.
- Can I tell you something?

245
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:05,730
The sun does not cause lightning, okay?

246
00:20:05,815 --> 00:20:07,190
Bro, I'm just telling you
what that guy said he heard.

247
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:09,734
Okay, I understand, but it just
sounds dumb when you're saying that.

248
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:18,034
I've never seen anything like this before.

249
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,579
That many strikes of lightning
in one spot?

250
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:22,247
- Is this the only place?
- Come on, put that down.

251
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:24,916
- You wanna step back, please?
- Step back.

252
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:27,252
- You're gonna fall in.
- Get back.

253
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:32,841
Back up, people.
People, back up back there.

254
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,803
Move back. Everybody back up.

255
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:40,348
Move back.

256
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:45,520
Is it hot?

257
00:20:45,605 --> 00:20:47,439
No.

258
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:49,774
- It's freezing.
- What is that?

259
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:51,610
Hey, move. You feel that?

260
00:20:51,694 --> 00:20:54,821
- I feel that.
- Hey, Bobby, come check this out.

261
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:56,656
- You feel that?
- Feel that?

262
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:58,533
- Yeah, I feel that.
- What is it, the subway?

263
00:20:58,618 --> 00:21:00,952
- There's no subway here.
- F train, maybe?

264
00:21:01,037 --> 00:21:02,454
That can't be the water main.

265
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:03,872
There's nothing else down there.

266
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:05,624
- Water main doesn't run through here.
- Feel that?

267
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,542
Well, there's something down there
and it's moving.

268
00:21:12,757 --> 00:21:15,091
Everybody, move back.

269
00:21:15,426 --> 00:21:17,385
Whoa. Back it up. Come on.

270
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:19,554
Let's go.

271
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:23,016
Come on, folks. Back up. Get back.

272
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:33,693
Help me out here. Get back.

273
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:40,242
- Go! Move!
- Everybody, get out of the way!

274
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:43,203
Everyone, back up!
Everyone, clear the intersection!

275
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:47,374
Get out of the way! Back up! Back up!
Get out of the way!

276
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:08,228
- Forget it! Get back!
- Get the hell out of the street!

277
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:21,575
Move away!

278
00:22:22,493 --> 00:22:25,287
Come on,
we've got to clear this area now!

279
00:23:15,755 --> 00:23:17,505
That's my car!

280
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:21,426
Go, go.

281
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,678
Get the hell out of here!

282
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:49,829
Oh, my God!

283
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:52,040
Come on, people! Let's go!

284
00:23:52,124 --> 00:23:53,875
Come on, back up!

285
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:56,544
Please! Move back!

286
00:25:18,961 --> 00:25:20,462
Watch it!

287
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:24,799
Oh, my God.

288
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,470
Ray, no. Stay, man.

289
00:25:37,354 --> 00:25:39,105
Just stay.

290
00:25:39,648 --> 00:25:43,485
- Just stay back here. Stay back!
- Wow.

291
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:00,502
Come on.

292
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:16,804
What happened?

293
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:20,600
What's going on?

294
00:28:21,602 --> 00:28:23,478
Dad, what's the matter?

295
00:28:24,647 --> 00:28:26,814
What's all that stuff all over you?

296
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:32,236
- Ray.
- What's all this stuff?

297
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:33,696
Hello?

298
00:28:34,448 --> 00:28:35,907
Ray?

299
00:29:09,942 --> 00:29:12,276
We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.

300
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:13,611
What? Why?
I have no idea what's going on.

301
00:29:13,696 --> 00:29:16,280
You're responsible for all the food
from the refrigerator and the cupboard,

302
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:17,615
- and put it in here.
- What's going on?

303
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,701
- Just tell me.
- Just do it.

304
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,620
- Rachel, sweetheart...
- Dad, you're really scaring me.

305
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:25,123
...I need you to get your suitcase...
- Dad.

306
00:29:25,207 --> 00:29:27,792
...the one that you brought,
bring it to me, okay?

307
00:29:27,876 --> 00:29:31,004
Can you just do that for me, darling?
Okay?

308
00:29:45,894 --> 00:29:47,520
I don't think it's a fire.

309
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,941
- See? That looks like smoke to me.
- What's happening?

310
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:55,987
I can't tell you now.
We've only got about another minute.

311
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:05,580
Please.

312
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,005
- Just keep it down.
- Ray, I'm standing right beside you.

313
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:16,299
Can you please answer me?

314
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:20,386
Just get in the front seat, Robbie.

315
00:30:25,184 --> 00:30:26,684
- Whose car is this?
- Just get in.

316
00:30:26,769 --> 00:30:28,603
Whose car is this?

317
00:30:31,273 --> 00:30:33,858
Hey. Hey, Ray.
You were absolutely right.

318
00:30:33,942 --> 00:30:36,486
That is exact... I had to change the...

319
00:30:37,613 --> 00:30:39,614
Ray? Hey.

320
00:30:39,698 --> 00:30:42,075
Hey, Ray? Ray.

321
00:30:43,118 --> 00:30:44,619
Ray.

322
00:30:45,621 --> 00:30:49,082
What? Come on, open up.
Open the door, come on.

323
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:52,001
- Open the door, Ray. What are you...
- Get in, Manny.

324
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:53,336
That's funny.
You got to get out of the car.

325
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,213
- Manny, get in the car.
- It's not my car. It's not your car.

326
00:30:55,297 --> 00:30:56,380
Manny, listen to me, pal.

327
00:30:56,465 --> 00:30:58,216
- Manny, Manny, shut up.
- Kids, Daddy's acting crazy.

328
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,218
You can't do this. Guy's gonna
come back, he's not gonna...

329
00:31:00,302 --> 00:31:01,928
Manny. Manny,
I don't have time to explain.

330
00:31:02,012 --> 00:31:03,554
You're busting my chops.
I got a shop to run.

331
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:05,098
- Manny, listen to me.
- No, Ray. Get out of the...

332
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:07,683
Get in, Manny, or you're gonna die.

333
00:31:07,768 --> 00:31:09,519
- What do you mean?
- Okay.

334
00:31:11,146 --> 00:31:12,647
All right, get out of the truck.
I'm not kidding now.

335
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:14,482
Get out of the car, Ray.

336
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:16,400
I'm not gonna get in. I'm not getting in.

337
00:31:16,485 --> 00:31:19,237
- Manny, get in with us.
- I'm not gonna get in trouble.

338
00:31:19,321 --> 00:31:22,657
- Look, I'm not fooling around...
- Close the door. Close it.

339
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:27,078
Ray, bring the car back, Ray.
It's not my car.

340
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:34,418
Get down! Get down, get down!
Get down!

341
00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:35,753
Is it the terrorists?

342
00:31:35,838 --> 00:31:38,798
- Just get down. Get down! Get down!
- Holy shit!

343
00:32:10,956 --> 00:32:13,124
- Where are we going?
- We got to go.

344
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:15,126
We got, maybe, like,
the only working car around here.

345
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,296
- I'm not stopping until we're clear of it.
- Clear of what?

346
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,797
- We got to go.
- What the hell is going on?

347
00:32:19,882 --> 00:32:22,383
- Look, you saw, we're under attack!
- By who?

348
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:23,801
Who is attacking us?

349
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:26,679
Rachel?
Rachel, you've got to keep it down.

350
00:32:26,763 --> 00:32:28,806
Rachel. Rachel. Shut up, Rachel.

351
00:32:28,891 --> 00:32:32,977
- You're freaking her out!
- Look, I'm driving! Do something!

352
00:32:33,061 --> 00:32:35,479
Okay, put them up, Rach.
Make the arms.

353
00:32:35,564 --> 00:32:38,399
This space right here, this is yours.
This belongs to you, right?

354
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:39,901
- Yes.
- You're safe in your space.

355
00:32:39,985 --> 00:32:41,444
- I'm safe in my space.
- You're safe in your space.

356
00:32:41,528 --> 00:32:43,154
Nothing can happen to you
in your space.

357
00:32:43,238 --> 00:32:44,280
- Okay.
- I'm really scared.

358
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:45,865
I'm gonna go to the front seat,
I'm gonna talk to Dad.

359
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:47,241
- No.
- I'll be two feet away. Okay?

360
00:32:47,326 --> 00:32:48,826
- Okay.
- Will you hold my hand?

361
00:32:48,911 --> 00:32:50,036
- Will you hold my hand?
- Yes.

362
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,954
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes.

363
00:32:53,957 --> 00:32:56,125
I wanna know everything you know.

364
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,336
This...

365
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,296
This thing, this machine,
it crawled out of the ground,

366
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,841
started torching everything.
It was killing everybody.

367
00:33:03,926 --> 00:33:06,636
What is it? Is it terrorists?

368
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,513
No, this came from someplace else.

369
00:33:09,598 --> 00:33:13,392
- What do you mean, like Europe?
- No, Robbie, not like Europe!

370
00:33:23,695 --> 00:33:28,157
That machine, it was already buried.

371
00:33:29,284 --> 00:33:31,410
Maybe it...

372
00:33:31,495 --> 00:33:34,622
It came down in the lightning storm.

373
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:38,709
- They came down in the lightning storm.
- What do you mean "came down"?

374
00:33:38,794 --> 00:33:41,754
- You just said it was buried.
- No, the machine I'm talking about

375
00:33:41,838 --> 00:33:45,967
was buried, but what came down
in the lightning storm,

376
00:33:46,051 --> 00:33:50,554
what operates it, that's the... You know.

377
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:52,014
- The what?
- That's the...

378
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:54,642
Why aren't there any helicopters
or airplanes?

379
00:33:54,726 --> 00:33:57,395
- It's the what?
- Hey, Rach. How you doing there, girl?

380
00:33:57,479 --> 00:33:58,813
- How is she doing?
- How you doing?

381
00:33:58,897 --> 00:34:00,022
- Fine.
- She's good.

382
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:02,483
Yeah? Good.
What was that thing you did with her?

383
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:03,776
Works sometimes.
She gets claustrophobic.

384
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,278
Yeah? Hey, Rachel? Hey.

385
00:34:05,362 --> 00:34:07,238
- I want Mom.
- Yeah, I know. You feel better?

386
00:34:07,322 --> 00:34:10,533
- I want Mom.
- Yeah? Tell me about it, you know?

387
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:12,034
- Take me to Mom's.
- Listen, what I need you to do is,

388
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,370
is I just need you to hold it together
for me, okay?

389
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:15,705
I want Mom!

390
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:18,082
When you start screaming like that,
you know, I can't really drive...

391
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,667
- Take me to Mom's!
- I know that.

392
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:21,252
That's where we're going right now.

393
00:34:21,336 --> 00:34:22,670
- Rachel...
- Take me to Mom's!

394
00:34:22,754 --> 00:34:24,338
I know!

395
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:42,189
Hurry up, Dad. Come on.

396
00:34:49,197 --> 00:34:51,115
Robbie, get the door.

397
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:54,618
Mom!

398
00:34:54,703 --> 00:34:56,454
- Mom!
- Mom!

399
00:34:56,538 --> 00:34:58,372
Mom!

400
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:06,547
Mom? Tim?

401
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,719
- Mom?
- Mom?

402
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:14,472
- Tim?
- Tim?

403
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:17,892
Tim?

404
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:19,894
Mom?

405
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:23,564
They're gone.

406
00:35:23,648 --> 00:35:25,775
Is she dead?

407
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:27,693
She's not dead. All right?

408
00:35:27,778 --> 00:35:29,445
She's just not here, okay?

409
00:35:29,529 --> 00:35:31,906
- They were never here.
- How do you know?

410
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,241
Because they're on their way to Boston.

411
00:35:34,326 --> 00:35:37,370
And so they just
kept on going up to Boston.

412
00:35:37,454 --> 00:35:39,163
They're probably
at your grandma's house by now.

413
00:35:39,247 --> 00:35:40,498
I'm gonna call her.

414
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:43,459
How come the lights are on here
and not at your place?

415
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:46,504
Because nothing bad happened here.
Okay?

416
00:35:46,588 --> 00:35:48,923
So we're safe here. All right?

417
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:51,175
Okay, Rachel? This is your area.

418
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:54,637
- Okay, you are safe...
- Dad, that's not how it goes.

419
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:57,515
Okay. Well, are you hungry?
I'll get you some food.

420
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,768
I'm gonna feed you.
Get something to eat.

421
00:36:00,852 --> 00:36:02,103
- What do we have? We have...
- Busy signal.

422
00:36:02,187 --> 00:36:04,021
- It's one of the fast ones.
- What is this? Ketchup, mustard...

423
00:36:04,106 --> 00:36:07,233
- You think all the circuits are down?
- Tabasco, barbecue sauce.

424
00:36:07,317 --> 00:36:10,027
You know, this is really good, Robbie.
Vinaigrette. I said pack food.

425
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,197
- What the hell is this?
- That's all that was in your kitchen.

426
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:15,908
Okay. That's all right.

427
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,036
All right. Okay.

428
00:36:22,457 --> 00:36:24,542
Food. Bread.

429
00:36:25,627 --> 00:36:28,129
Okay. We're gonna have...

430
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:31,132
Let's get some sandwiches.

431
00:36:33,844 --> 00:36:35,428
Wanna see me deal?

432
00:36:36,138 --> 00:36:37,972
Wanna see me deal? Here we go.

433
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:40,683
There's two for you.
There's two for Robbie.

434
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:42,852
There's two for me, one for the house.

435
00:36:46,148 --> 00:36:47,565
Okay.

436
00:36:47,649 --> 00:36:50,484
Maybe after we eat something,
I'll go down and show you guys...

437
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:53,404
Teach you how to play some poker?
A little five-card stud?

438
00:36:53,488 --> 00:36:56,615
- Maybe a little blackjack.
- I'm allergic to peanut butter.

439
00:36:57,409 --> 00:36:59,118
Since when?

440
00:36:59,202 --> 00:37:00,494
Birth.

441
00:37:04,207 --> 00:37:05,958
Okay, well, here.

442
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:08,085
You can eat the bread. Okay?

443
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,628
I'm not hungry.

444
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:12,923
Okay, well,

445
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:15,342
Robbie and I are gonna be eating
peanut butter sandwiches.

446
00:37:15,427 --> 00:37:18,512
- Want jelly on this sandwich?
- I'm not hungry either.

447
00:37:18,597 --> 00:37:21,891
You're not hungry either? Okay.

448
00:37:21,975 --> 00:37:24,268
Okay, that's fine.

449
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:35,362
Everybody just relax, okay?

450
00:37:35,447 --> 00:37:38,949
Because we're here now.
We're safe, and we're gonna stay.

451
00:37:39,034 --> 00:37:41,243
And in the morning,
your mom and Tim are gonna be here.

452
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:42,953
And everything's gonna be fine.

453
00:37:43,038 --> 00:37:44,497
Okay?

454
00:37:45,957 --> 00:37:47,374
Okay.

455
00:37:51,379 --> 00:37:53,881
If everything's fine, why do we
have to sleep in the basement?

456
00:37:53,965 --> 00:37:57,301
- We've got perfectly good beds.
- Hey, it's like a slumber party.

457
00:37:57,385 --> 00:37:58,886
What are you afraid
is gonna happen to us?

458
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,554
Nice basement.

459
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:03,891
I wanna sleep in my bed.
I've got back problems.

460
00:38:05,644 --> 00:38:07,269
Okay. Well...

461
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:09,980
You know on the weather channel
when there's a tornado,

462
00:38:10,065 --> 00:38:12,691
and they tell you to go down
to the basement for safety? It's like that.

463
00:38:12,776 --> 00:38:14,818
- There's gonna be tornadoes?
- Okay, Rachel.

464
00:38:14,903 --> 00:38:17,530
Hey, no more talking, okay?

465
00:38:17,614 --> 00:38:19,573
- Could you be a little nicer to me?
- No more talking.

466
00:38:19,658 --> 00:38:20,950
God.

467
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,914
- Wanna stay here?
- Yeah.

468
00:38:26,998 --> 00:38:28,582
- Good.
- Good night. Love you.

469
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:30,417
Love you, Rach.

470
00:39:44,868 --> 00:39:46,827
Is the lightning back?

471
00:39:48,163 --> 00:39:50,331
No, this is something else.

472
00:40:10,018 --> 00:40:12,603
- What's that sound?
- I've never heard that before!

473
00:40:12,687 --> 00:40:14,104
Is it them? Is it them?

474
00:40:16,149 --> 00:40:17,358
We got to go.

475
00:40:17,442 --> 00:40:19,318
Where do we go?
Robbie, this is your house.

476
00:40:19,402 --> 00:40:20,944
Where do we go?

477
00:40:31,998 --> 00:40:33,624
No, no, no, wait!

478
00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:55,104
Are we still alive?

479
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:49,551
Down here.

480
00:42:53,807 --> 00:42:55,766
Were you on this plane?

481
00:42:56,976 --> 00:42:59,228
Are you... Are you a passenger?

482
00:43:06,152 --> 00:43:09,071
How you doing?
Wanna help me open this?

483
00:43:11,574 --> 00:43:13,450
Are you a passenger?

484
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,327
He's deaf.

485
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:19,122
The shell went off right beside him.
Camera on his shoulder saved his life.

486
00:43:19,207 --> 00:43:20,666
You hear that, Max?

487
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,544
Your stupid camera
saved your stupid life.

488
00:43:24,212 --> 00:43:26,046
Where were you?

489
00:43:26,548 --> 00:43:29,258
Out there in the Pine Barrens.

490
00:43:29,342 --> 00:43:31,301
We were attached to
a National Guard unit.

491
00:43:31,386 --> 00:43:32,970
The 83rd Mechanized.

492
00:43:33,054 --> 00:43:35,347
They moved on one of those things
around midnight.

493
00:43:35,431 --> 00:43:37,140
They've got some kind of shield
around them.

494
00:43:37,225 --> 00:43:39,977
You can't see it, but everything
we fire at them detonates too early,

495
00:43:40,061 --> 00:43:43,313
before we can get close enough
to cause any damage.

496
00:43:43,398 --> 00:43:47,192
When they flash that thing,
everything lights up like Hiroshima.

497
00:43:47,861 --> 00:43:50,070
There's more than one?

498
00:43:51,155 --> 00:43:52,823
You got to be kidding me, right?

499
00:43:54,284 --> 00:43:56,493
We were feeding New York,
but New York went dark.

500
00:43:56,578 --> 00:43:59,037
So we patched over to DC,
they went down.

501
00:43:59,122 --> 00:44:01,957
LA, Chicago, uplinked to London.

502
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:05,294
Even called the affiliates
to try to get them to catch the feed,

503
00:44:05,378 --> 00:44:08,213
but nobody answers.
It's the same everywhere.

504
00:44:08,298 --> 00:44:12,217
Once the Tripods start to move,
no more news comes out of that area.

505
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:25,022
My God.

506
00:44:26,107 --> 00:44:28,066
You ain't seen nothing yet.

507
00:44:30,904 --> 00:44:34,197
I saw that storm.
I was right in the middle of one of those.

508
00:44:34,282 --> 00:44:35,991
Well, you didn't see it like this.

509
00:44:36,075 --> 00:44:38,535
Those machines come up
from under the ground, right?

510
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,622
So that means they must've been
buried here a long time ago.

511
00:44:41,706 --> 00:44:45,918
So who's driving the goddamn things?
Watch the lightning.

512
00:44:46,002 --> 00:44:47,711
Watch it.

513
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:50,589
Watch the lightning.

514
00:44:50,673 --> 00:44:52,925
Keep watching the lightning.

515
00:44:56,638 --> 00:44:58,639
What is that?

516
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:03,060
That is them.
They come down in capsules,

517
00:45:03,144 --> 00:45:06,104
riding the lightning into the ground,
into the machines, right?

518
00:45:09,067 --> 00:45:11,068
You hear that?

519
00:45:11,152 --> 00:45:13,570
We're getting the hell out of here.

520
00:45:16,991 --> 00:45:18,742
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

521
00:45:20,328 --> 00:45:23,413
Hey, were you on that plane?

522
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:28,794
That's too bad.
It would've been a really great story.

523
00:45:30,505 --> 00:45:32,673
Look at me. Look at me.

524
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,092
You keep your eyes only on me,
understand?

525
00:45:35,176 --> 00:45:37,135
- Okay.
- Don't look down. Don't look around me.

526
00:45:37,845 --> 00:45:40,973
I'm taking you to the car.
You're gonna want to look around.

527
00:45:41,057 --> 00:45:42,766
But you're not going to.

528
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,393
- Are you?
- No.

529
00:45:44,686 --> 00:45:48,188
You're doing good. You're doing good.
Keep your eyes on me.

530
00:45:48,272 --> 00:45:49,564
I'm going right to Boston.

531
00:45:49,649 --> 00:45:51,984
- We're gonna see your mom.
- I'm not gonna look, Dad.

532
00:45:52,068 --> 00:45:54,152
That's a girl. That's my girl. Now listen.

533
00:45:54,237 --> 00:45:56,071
- I want you to close your eyes, okay?
- Okay.

534
00:45:56,155 --> 00:45:58,615
Got them closed? There you go.

535
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,034
- Keep them closed for me.
- Okay.

536
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:07,874
Robbie, get in.

537
00:46:09,585 --> 00:46:11,378
- Robbie, get in!
- Why are you yelling?

538
00:46:11,462 --> 00:46:12,963
It's okay.

539
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,050
Get in.

540
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:40,032
- Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?
- Because I don't want everybody

541
00:46:40,116 --> 00:46:42,659
to see that we've got a working car.
We'll stay along the Hudson

542
00:46:42,744 --> 00:46:46,079
till we find an open bridge or ferry,
then we're gonna cross the Hudson.

543
00:46:46,164 --> 00:46:50,417
We'll take the back roads across
Connecticut, all the way to Boston.

544
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:53,420
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, running, hiding.

545
00:46:53,504 --> 00:46:55,714
- Hiding in their basements.
- If we had any balls, we'd go back there

546
00:46:55,798 --> 00:46:59,468
- and find one of those things and kill it.
- Right. Yeah, good.

547
00:46:59,552 --> 00:47:01,636
Why don't you just let me
make the big decisions, okay?

548
00:47:01,721 --> 00:47:03,305
Which would be when? Never, Ray?

549
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:04,848
- Never's about your speed.
- Stop it, Robbie.

550
00:47:04,932 --> 00:47:06,975
Enough of the "Ray" shit. All right?

551
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,477
- It's "Dad," "sir"...
- Don't fight!

552
00:47:08,561 --> 00:47:10,687
...or if you want, "Mr. Ferrier."

553
00:47:10,772 --> 00:47:14,066
That sounds a little weird to me,
but you decide.

554
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:17,444
- Dad?
- Yes, Rachel.

555
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:22,032
I've got to go to the bathroom.

556
00:47:22,867 --> 00:47:24,451
Really?

557
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:33,293
- I got to go.
- Not so fast, not so fast, all right?

558
00:47:33,377 --> 00:47:35,337
There's two things
we got to watch out for.

559
00:47:35,421 --> 00:47:38,006
And the second is people
who might want our car.

560
00:47:38,091 --> 00:47:40,842
- There's nobody around.
- Yeah. I got to go.

561
00:47:48,518 --> 00:47:51,353
All right. Rachel?
Rachel, it's good right there.

562
00:47:51,437 --> 00:47:53,730
I'm not going in front of you guys.

563
00:47:53,815 --> 00:47:56,233
All right,
then just go where I can see you.

564
00:47:56,317 --> 00:47:57,818
Are you crazy?

565
00:47:57,902 --> 00:47:59,903
- Don't look!
- Well, I'm not gonna look.

566
00:47:59,987 --> 00:48:02,823
- Just stay in sight!
- That's looking!

567
00:48:04,242 --> 00:48:07,119
Okay, well, listen, every time
you guys don't listen to me,

568
00:48:07,203 --> 00:48:10,497
I'm telling your mother, okay?
I'm making a list.

569
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:13,708
Making a list.

570
00:48:56,002 --> 00:48:59,462
- I told you to stay where I could see you.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

571
00:49:14,228 --> 00:49:15,812
Stop! Don't go!

572
00:49:15,897 --> 00:49:18,148
Wait! Stop! Let me on!

573
00:49:18,232 --> 00:49:20,567
Let me on! Give me a hand!

574
00:49:20,651 --> 00:49:22,235
Wait! Stop!

575
00:49:22,361 --> 00:49:24,154
- Stop! Give me a hand!
- Hey, watch it, kid,

576
00:49:24,238 --> 00:49:25,280
you're gonna get yourself run over!

577
00:49:25,364 --> 00:49:28,325
- Give me a hand! You have room!
- Robbie!

578
00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:31,411
- Robbie, you wanna go in that direction?
- Stop! Stop! Wait!

579
00:49:31,495 --> 00:49:34,289
There's nothing living
in that direction, Robbie.

580
00:49:34,373 --> 00:49:36,750
What do you care?
You never gave a shit before.

581
00:49:36,834 --> 00:49:39,085
- You never gave a shit!
- Okay, hard-ass,

582
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:41,463
what's your plan, huh?
You're in charge now!

583
00:49:41,547 --> 00:49:43,048
You tell me what we're doing.
What do we do?

584
00:49:43,132 --> 00:49:45,508
We catch up with these soldiers!
Hook up with whoever else isn't dead,

585
00:49:45,593 --> 00:49:47,052
and we get back at them.

586
00:49:47,136 --> 00:49:50,597
We get back at them.
That's what we do.

587
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:55,018
Now let's try one that doesn't involve
your 10-year-old sister joining the Army.

588
00:49:55,102 --> 00:49:57,354
- You have anything like that?
- Why don't you just tell us the truth?

589
00:49:57,438 --> 00:49:59,606
- Wanna try something like that?
- You have no idea which way to go.

590
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:02,234
- You have anything like that?
- You wanna come off all wise and shit!

591
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:05,028
You only chose Boston
because you hoped Mom was there.

592
00:50:05,112 --> 00:50:07,530
And if she's there,
you can dump us on her.

593
00:50:07,615 --> 00:50:11,284
You can dump us on her, and then
you'll only have to care about yourself,

594
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:14,371
which is exactly the way you like it.

595
00:50:15,915 --> 00:50:19,709
Robbie! Where are you trying to go?

596
00:50:19,794 --> 00:50:22,254
What are you trying to do?

597
00:50:23,214 --> 00:50:26,258
Who's gonna take care of me if you go?

598
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:47,320
This is a test of
the Emergency Alert System.

599
00:50:47,655 --> 00:50:50,365
If this had been an actual emergency,
official messages

600
00:50:50,449 --> 00:50:54,452
from federal, state or local authorities
would have followed the alert tone.

601
00:50:54,537 --> 00:50:57,539
This concludes the test
of the Emergency Alert...

602
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:02,252
I'll close my eyes.
Why don't you drive for a bit?

603
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,005
I don't have a license.

604
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:08,466
Since when has that stopped you?

605
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:40,832
Ray.

606
00:51:42,835 --> 00:51:45,170
Ray! Dad!

607
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:50,342
You think you could...

608
00:51:50,426 --> 00:51:53,136
You think you could...
Do you think you could...

609
00:51:53,888 --> 00:51:55,388
Don't stop.

610
00:51:55,473 --> 00:51:57,640
Don't take your foot off. Okay?

611
00:51:57,725 --> 00:52:00,810
I got it, but keep your foot on.
Okay, I got it. I got it.

612
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,772
- Where is everybody going?
- I don't know, Rach.

613
00:52:03,856 --> 00:52:05,982
But we do, right?

614
00:52:06,067 --> 00:52:07,984
Yeah, we do.

615
00:52:19,747 --> 00:52:21,414
Why did he do that?

616
00:52:23,584 --> 00:52:25,668
- Why is he doing that?
- He wants a ride, Rach.

617
00:52:25,753 --> 00:52:29,005
- Everybody just wants a ride.
- Can we give him one?

618
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:32,717
Sit back and put on your seat belt.
Robbie, put on your seat belt.

619
00:52:32,802 --> 00:52:34,761
Put on your seat belt, Rachel.

620
00:52:37,932 --> 00:52:39,933
- Be careful.
- How'd you fix this?

621
00:52:40,017 --> 00:52:42,268
- How'd you fix the car?
- Please!

622
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,357
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.

623
00:52:47,441 --> 00:52:49,317
Please, get away from the car.

624
00:52:49,402 --> 00:52:51,277
Hey! Stop the car.

625
00:52:51,362 --> 00:52:54,114
- Stop the car!
- Get off the car!

626
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:57,242
You could carry 20 people in there!

627
00:52:57,326 --> 00:52:59,702
- Stop the car!
- Get off the car!

628
00:52:59,787 --> 00:53:01,454
Stop the car!

629
00:53:05,418 --> 00:53:07,043
Hold on.

630
00:53:07,128 --> 00:53:08,711
- Wait, wait.
- Look out. Look out.

631
00:53:08,796 --> 00:53:10,380
Look out! Hold on!

632
00:53:19,265 --> 00:53:20,515
Are you okay?

633
00:53:30,484 --> 00:53:31,651
Stop!

634
00:53:31,735 --> 00:53:33,153
- Ray!
- Robbie!

635
00:53:33,946 --> 00:53:35,488
No, wait! Wait!

636
00:53:35,573 --> 00:53:38,575
No! No, just wait! Okay! Wait! Stop!

637
00:53:38,659 --> 00:53:40,660
- Just stop!
- Daddy!

638
00:53:40,744 --> 00:53:42,287
Rachel!

639
00:53:42,913 --> 00:53:44,664
Get out of there!

640
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,834
Robbie!

641
00:53:55,009 --> 00:53:57,135
Daddy!

642
00:53:57,219 --> 00:53:59,679
- Ray!
- Get in the car!

643
00:54:04,685 --> 00:54:07,479
- Help!
- Rachel! Get out of the car!

644
00:54:07,563 --> 00:54:09,689
Rachel, get... Get out of the car.

645
00:54:09,773 --> 00:54:11,941
- Get out!
- Daddy!

646
00:54:19,658 --> 00:54:21,784
- Take it easy!
- Get off the car! Get off the car!

647
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:26,956
Get off! Get off the car. Move! Move!

648
00:54:27,041 --> 00:54:28,041
Where's my son?

649
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:29,125
You don't need that, man.
Put the gun down.

650
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:31,669
- Where's my son? Robbie!
- Cool down, man.

651
00:54:31,754 --> 00:54:33,046
- Put the gun down, man.
- Robbie!

652
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:34,714
Put it down.

653
00:54:39,762 --> 00:54:41,387
Dad!

654
00:54:43,224 --> 00:54:44,974
Okay, man, now, listen.

655
00:54:45,142 --> 00:54:48,186
- Put down the gun. I'm taking the car.
- My daughter's in the car.

656
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,396
- Put down the gun. I'm taking the car.
- Please. All I want...

657
00:54:50,481 --> 00:54:53,149
- Put down the goddamn gun!
- All I want is my daughter.

658
00:54:53,234 --> 00:54:55,777
- I'm taking the car, man.
- Please, I just want my daughter.

659
00:54:55,861 --> 00:54:57,820
Please, let me...
Let me just take my daughter. Can I...

660
00:54:57,905 --> 00:54:59,447
- All I want is my daughter.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

661
00:54:59,532 --> 00:55:00,782
- Go ahead, man. Take her.
- Take my daughter?

662
00:55:00,866 --> 00:55:01,824
Take her. Yeah. Yeah.

663
00:55:01,909 --> 00:55:03,535
Robbie.

664
00:55:12,962 --> 00:55:14,754
Take me with you.

665
00:56:16,358 --> 00:56:18,401
Have you seen this girl?
This is my daughter.

666
00:56:18,485 --> 00:56:21,237
He needs his medicine.

667
00:56:32,166 --> 00:56:34,083
We've got it the worst,
that's what I heard.

668
00:56:34,168 --> 00:56:37,253
The US, mostly.
South America and Asia, some.

669
00:56:37,338 --> 00:56:39,047
There's nothing going on in Europe.

670
00:56:39,131 --> 00:56:41,841
Europe got the worst of it,
that's what everybody's saying.

671
00:56:41,925 --> 00:56:44,427
- Completely wiped out some of it.
- I don't give a shit who it is.

672
00:56:44,511 --> 00:56:46,971
I got up close to one of those things
in Stanfordville.

673
00:56:47,056 --> 00:56:48,931
If they're all over the place, we're dead.

674
00:56:49,016 --> 00:56:51,893
- Looks like the power's still on here.
- Yeah.

675
00:56:51,977 --> 00:56:54,020
Yeah, power's still on.

676
00:56:54,188 --> 00:56:57,106
Because nothing bad's come up
from the ground.

677
00:56:57,191 --> 00:57:00,526
- Hold on. Hold on, move back.
- Watch out there, lady.

678
00:57:01,028 --> 00:57:03,029
I said, move back.

679
00:57:39,483 --> 00:57:43,778
Unless you are O-positive
and Rh-negative, thank you very much,

680
00:57:43,862 --> 00:57:46,864
but we already have
more blood than we can use.

681
00:57:46,949 --> 00:57:50,451
Again, if you are O-positive,

682
00:57:50,536 --> 00:57:54,080
Rh-negative, identify yourselves.

683
00:57:54,164 --> 00:57:56,290
If you are not, thank you very much.

684
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:59,419
We already have more blood
than we can use for the transfusions.

685
00:57:59,503 --> 00:58:01,587
Let's go, folks.

686
00:58:01,672 --> 00:58:04,590
This way. This way. Keep it moving.

687
00:58:04,675 --> 00:58:08,886
Keep it moving. This way.
Let's go, folks. Keep it moving.

688
00:58:08,971 --> 00:58:13,224
Please move forward calmly.
The boat can make more than one trip.

689
00:58:13,308 --> 00:58:17,603
Please move forward calmly.
Take your time. Don't rush.

690
00:58:17,688 --> 00:58:19,981
Ray! Ray! Ray!

691
00:58:20,065 --> 00:58:22,525
- Sheryl?
- Yeah. Hey.

692
00:58:22,609 --> 00:58:24,318
Oh, my gosh, is this your...

693
00:58:24,403 --> 00:58:25,737
- Are these your kids?
- This is Rachel.

694
00:58:25,821 --> 00:58:28,531
Hi, I'm Sheryl. How are you?
This is my daughter, Nora.

695
00:58:28,615 --> 00:58:31,033
- Nora. I've heard about you, Nora.
- Hi.

696
00:58:31,118 --> 00:58:34,036
- This is my son, Robbie.
- Just like Dad.

697
00:58:48,927 --> 00:58:52,096
- It's good to see you as well.
- Trees are funny.

698
00:58:52,181 --> 00:58:56,601
We're gonna move a few cars out
of the way to make some more space.

699
00:58:57,728 --> 00:58:59,729
You're gonna have to give us
a few minutes.

700
00:58:59,813 --> 00:59:02,774
But don't worry,
there'll be plenty of room for everybody.

701
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:06,319
- We got sick people here. Let us on.
- Let us on, for Christ's sake.

702
00:59:40,187 --> 00:59:44,065
Cast off. Get that ramp up.

703
00:59:44,149 --> 00:59:47,276
Cast off now. Get that ramp up.

704
00:59:47,361 --> 00:59:48,611
Cast off.

705
00:59:48,695 --> 00:59:51,656
No more people. No more people.
We're taking the ramp up.

706
01:00:17,391 --> 01:00:20,810
Stay close. Stay close.

707
01:00:20,894 --> 01:00:23,646
Everybody, stop. Everybody, stop.

708
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:27,066
- Wait, wait, wait. Just...
- Back up. Back up.

709
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,317
- There's room.
- Just stay back.

710
01:00:28,402 --> 01:00:29,986
There's no more room.
There's no more room.

711
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:31,654
Just listen to me. There's three of us.

712
01:00:31,738 --> 01:00:34,532
- Five. There's only five of us.
- There's no more room.

713
01:00:34,616 --> 01:00:35,992
Okay, man, just don't push me.

714
01:00:36,076 --> 01:00:38,327
- Sir, there's no more room.
- There is plenty of room.

715
01:00:38,412 --> 01:00:40,872
- There's room for hundreds more.
- Sir...

716
01:00:40,956 --> 01:00:42,081
- Everybody, wait.
- Hold on.

717
01:00:42,165 --> 01:00:43,541
- You just stay with me.
- Okay.

718
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:44,959
Grab my jacket.

719
01:00:45,043 --> 01:00:46,627
Everybody, back up.

720
01:00:46,712 --> 01:00:47,837
Back up.

721
01:00:47,921 --> 01:00:49,505
I got you, Ferrier.

722
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:51,340
- Oh, Jesus.
- You okay?

723
01:00:51,425 --> 01:00:52,466
- Yeah.
- Come on. Come.

724
01:00:52,551 --> 01:00:55,094
- Okay. Jesus. Oh, my God.
- Come on. Come on.

725
01:00:55,429 --> 01:00:57,096
Watch out.

726
01:01:04,354 --> 01:01:05,438
Come on.

727
01:01:06,106 --> 01:01:08,399
- Move. Move. Move.
- Ray.

728
01:01:08,483 --> 01:01:10,318
Ray!

729
01:01:11,361 --> 01:01:13,613
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Move it! Get out of here!

730
01:01:15,073 --> 01:01:17,241
Go. I can go with him.

731
01:01:17,326 --> 01:01:18,826
Sheryl?

732
01:01:18,911 --> 01:01:21,162
- Stay back.
- Go with them. Go.

733
01:01:21,246 --> 01:01:22,330
- Ray.
- Sheryl?

734
01:01:22,414 --> 01:01:24,165
- Everybody...
- Sheryl?

735
01:01:24,249 --> 01:01:27,043
- There's room on the boat.
- Let us through, God damn it.

736
01:01:27,127 --> 01:01:29,211
- There's still room on the boat.
- She's a child.

737
01:01:29,296 --> 01:01:31,005
- Robbie.
- There's room on the...

738
01:01:31,089 --> 01:01:33,299
There's still room on the boat.
There's room on the boat.

739
01:01:33,383 --> 01:01:34,425
Up there!

740
01:01:39,473 --> 01:01:41,265
- Robbie.
- Just stay with me.

741
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:43,392
Stay with me, Robbie.

742
01:01:47,105 --> 01:01:48,648
Robbie!

743
01:02:13,423 --> 01:02:15,925
- Robbie. Robbie.
- Robbie.

744
01:02:16,009 --> 01:02:18,010
Robbie!

745
01:02:21,682 --> 01:02:23,933
- Robbie.
- Come on.

746
01:02:24,017 --> 01:02:26,435
Here. Grab my hand.

747
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,396
Here. Hold on.

748
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,773
I got you. Hold on.

749
01:02:30,857 --> 01:02:32,692
Take my hand.

750
01:02:32,776 --> 01:02:34,944
Take it. Take my hand.

751
01:02:35,028 --> 01:02:36,445
Here!

752
01:02:56,883 --> 01:02:59,385
Oh, my God.

753
01:03:18,238 --> 01:03:19,238
Robbie!

754
01:04:03,575 --> 01:04:05,534
Swim. Swim this way.

755
01:04:12,626 --> 01:04:15,419
- Robbie!
- Robbie!

756
01:04:59,005 --> 01:05:02,133
- Help me. Help me with her.
- Here, Rach.

757
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:07,513
Don't stop. Don't stop.

758
01:05:07,848 --> 01:05:09,515
Don't stop.

759
01:05:26,491 --> 01:05:28,450
Oh, my God.

760
01:06:31,306 --> 01:06:44,693
Robbie, slow down.

761
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:01,752
- Robbie.
- We gotta stay together, Robbie.

762
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:05,422
Robbie?

763
01:07:05,507 --> 01:07:07,007
Stay together.

764
01:07:07,092 --> 01:07:08,676
Robbie!

765
01:07:12,013 --> 01:07:14,181
Get back here!

766
01:07:18,687 --> 01:07:20,271
Robbie!

767
01:07:20,355 --> 01:07:23,524
No, Robbie! Come back!

768
01:07:31,324 --> 01:07:32,950
Robbie.

769
01:07:33,034 --> 01:07:34,994
Don't move. Don't move.

770
01:07:35,078 --> 01:07:37,997
Now, for God's sake, stay right here.
I'm coming right back.

771
01:07:38,081 --> 01:07:39,915
- Robbie!
- Stop those people.

772
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,001
- Turn around. Turn around.
- Robbie.

773
01:07:43,128 --> 01:07:45,796
Robbie.

774
01:07:46,089 --> 01:07:47,214
What the hell?

775
01:07:47,299 --> 01:07:49,341
Why are you doing this?

776
01:07:52,804 --> 01:07:56,223
Pull back.
Five hundred meters to my 10 o'clock.

777
01:07:58,268 --> 01:08:00,394
Jekyll, no effect on target. No effect.

778
01:08:00,478 --> 01:08:01,937
Roger. No effect.

779
01:08:02,022 --> 01:08:04,732
Our mission, Lieutenant,
is to delay their advance

780
01:08:04,816 --> 01:08:08,152
till those refugees get to safety.
Now, keep firing.

781
01:08:09,863 --> 01:08:12,740
You've gotta listen. Turn around!
I want you to listen to me.

782
01:08:15,702 --> 01:08:16,952
Listen to me.

783
01:08:17,037 --> 01:08:18,495
Go back down the hill.

784
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:20,873
All of you, just turn around.

785
01:08:33,053 --> 01:08:35,471
- Don't do this. I know you wanna fight.
- I wanna be here.

786
01:08:35,555 --> 01:08:37,389
- I need to see this.
- I know it seems like you have to,

787
01:08:37,474 --> 01:08:40,559
- but you don't. You don't.
- Please, let me go.

788
01:08:40,643 --> 01:08:43,062
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

789
01:08:43,146 --> 01:08:45,147
What are you doing here all by yourself?

790
01:08:45,231 --> 01:08:46,732
Look, sweetie,
you gotta come with us, please.

791
01:08:46,816 --> 01:08:48,817
No. My dad's getting my brother.
I have to stay here.

792
01:08:48,902 --> 01:08:50,110
- You can't stay here.
- We gotta go.

793
01:08:50,195 --> 01:08:51,820
- I'm not gonna leave her alone.
- Leave.

794
01:08:51,905 --> 01:08:54,239
I'm not letting you do this.
You can hate me.

795
01:08:54,324 --> 01:08:56,200
- You can hate me. But I love you.
- Let me go. Please.

796
01:08:56,284 --> 01:08:58,035
- Let me go. Dad.
- I'm not letting you do this.

797
01:08:58,119 --> 01:09:00,746
I can't. No. Please. Please don't pull me.

798
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:03,332
It's gonna be okay. You need
to come with us. It is not safe...

799
01:09:03,416 --> 01:09:05,542
Please, let me stay here. Please.
I can't go with you.

800
01:09:05,627 --> 01:09:07,169
- My dad's right there.
- Please, come.

801
01:09:07,253 --> 01:09:09,171
- Please, my dad's right there.
- Will you just listen to me?

802
01:09:09,255 --> 01:09:12,049
I need to be here. I want to see this.

803
01:09:12,133 --> 01:09:14,635
Wait. Wait. Just stay for Rachel.
Stay for your sister.

804
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,263
Please, let me go.
You need to let me go.

805
01:09:21,601 --> 01:09:22,935
All right. Okay. All right.
You're coming with us.

806
01:09:23,019 --> 01:09:24,186
- We gotta go! Now!
- Dad.

807
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:26,188
- We're going now.
- No, no, you don't understand.

808
01:09:26,272 --> 01:09:36,073
Dad!

809
01:09:41,287 --> 01:09:44,206
Let me go! Dad!

810
01:09:46,126 --> 01:09:49,670
Guide on. Guide on. Black Six.
Attack. Attack. Attack.

811
01:09:51,923 --> 01:09:53,632
Stop.

812
01:09:53,716 --> 01:09:56,885
- That's my dad.
- I'm her father. I'm her father.

813
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:58,720
- We're so sorry.
- We thought she was alone.

814
01:09:58,805 --> 01:10:01,640
- She was standing by the tree...
- She's fine. Let's go! Let's go!

815
01:10:05,812 --> 01:10:07,146
Robbie.

816
01:10:17,323 --> 01:10:19,783
Robbie!

817
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,303
Over here.

818
01:10:39,387 --> 01:10:40,846
Over here!

819
01:10:44,476 --> 01:10:46,185
Hurry.

820
01:11:05,788 --> 01:11:07,414
Are you all right?

821
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:09,208
Hey.

822
01:11:11,419 --> 01:11:13,212
What about you, huh?

823
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,894
There you go.

824
01:11:30,438 --> 01:11:32,439
Is that comfortable?

825
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,985
I need you to close your eyes
now, okay?

826
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:38,904
You need some sleep.

827
01:11:41,282 --> 01:11:42,783
Dad?

828
01:11:42,867 --> 01:11:44,576
He's gonna meet us.

829
01:11:45,787 --> 01:11:47,996
Hey. Robbie's gonna meet us, Rach.

830
01:11:48,081 --> 01:11:50,541
In Boston, at your grandma's.

831
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:53,794
What do you think
Mom's doing right this minute?

832
01:11:53,878 --> 01:11:55,379
Mom?

833
01:11:56,714 --> 01:11:58,799
Boston. She's waiting.

834
01:11:59,217 --> 01:12:02,719
And I know she's not sleeping,
because she is so worried about you.

835
01:12:02,804 --> 01:12:06,181
And she's in Grandma's kitchen,
and she's...

836
01:12:07,934 --> 01:12:10,936
She's making that awful tea she makes.

837
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,896
And they're all just...

838
01:12:13,565 --> 01:12:16,942
They're all just counting the minutes
until they see you again.

839
01:12:19,112 --> 01:12:22,072
What is this? What is this?

840
01:12:22,699 --> 01:12:25,367
- I won.
- You won?

841
01:12:25,451 --> 01:12:27,744
The walk, trot and canter.

842
01:12:27,912 --> 01:12:29,871
Third place.

843
01:12:38,131 --> 01:12:40,924
Sing me Lullaby and Goodnight.

844
01:12:44,971 --> 01:12:46,972
I don't know that one.

845
01:12:47,974 --> 01:12:50,058
Sing me Hushabye Mountain.

846
01:12:53,605 --> 01:12:57,065
I'm sorry, Rach. I don't...
I don't know that one either.

847
01:13:18,171 --> 01:13:21,632
I'm not bragging, babe
So don't put me down

848
01:13:22,216 --> 01:13:25,385
'Cause I got the fastest
Set of wheels in town

849
01:13:25,553 --> 01:13:28,680
Something comes up to me
They don't even try

850
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:33,852
'Cause if I had a set of wings
Man, you know she could fly

851
01:13:34,145 --> 01:13:36,688
She's my little deuce coupe

852
01:13:37,649 --> 01:13:40,025
You don't know what I got

853
01:13:41,194 --> 01:13:43,612
Just my little deuce coupe

854
01:13:46,115 --> 01:13:48,367
You don't know what I got

855
01:13:56,626 --> 01:13:58,377
Peach schnapps.

856
01:13:58,461 --> 01:14:02,047
Disgusting, I know it.
Found a whole case of this shit.

857
01:14:09,222 --> 01:14:10,931
Thank you.

858
01:14:16,062 --> 01:14:18,188
I'm sorry about your son.

859
01:14:18,272 --> 01:14:19,856
We got separated. He's...

860
01:14:19,941 --> 01:14:23,068
He's gonna meet us in Boston.

861
01:14:29,909 --> 01:14:31,076
Did you...

862
01:14:33,329 --> 01:14:35,580
Did you lose anybody?

863
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:39,418
All of them.

864
01:14:42,213 --> 01:14:44,756
Harlan Ogilvy.

865
01:14:45,717 --> 01:14:47,092
Ray Ferrier.

866
01:14:47,176 --> 01:14:48,844
I got water.

867
01:14:50,221 --> 01:14:52,431
Food enough for weeks.

868
01:14:53,266 --> 01:14:56,017
You're welcome to stay. Both of you.

869
01:14:56,185 --> 01:14:57,894
I'm sorry.

870
01:14:58,938 --> 01:15:00,981
I'm gonna get some sleep.

871
01:15:02,734 --> 01:15:07,696
Those machines,
those Tripods they got,

872
01:15:09,782 --> 01:15:11,742
they buried them.

873
01:15:12,744 --> 01:15:14,536
Right under our feet.

874
01:15:15,955 --> 01:15:18,039
Since before there...

875
01:15:18,332 --> 01:15:20,625
There were even people here.

876
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:24,296
They've been planning this
for a million years.

877
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:29,134
- We're beat to shit.
- Please.

878
01:15:29,218 --> 01:15:31,511
- My daughter...
- Think about it.

879
01:15:34,599 --> 01:15:38,101
They defeated the greatest power
in the world in a couple days.

880
01:15:38,186 --> 01:15:40,395
Walked right over us.

881
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,690
And these are only the first.
They'll keep coming.

882
01:15:44,859 --> 01:15:46,026
This is not a war

883
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:49,362
any more than there's
a war between men and maggots.

884
01:15:49,822 --> 01:15:51,823
This is an extermination.

885
01:16:02,502 --> 01:16:03,835
You afraid?

886
01:16:06,005 --> 01:16:07,798
Of course I am.

887
01:16:10,468 --> 01:16:12,594
I been around death plenty.

888
01:16:13,971 --> 01:16:15,680
I drive an ambulance in the city...

889
01:16:15,765 --> 01:16:18,225
Drove an ambulance in the city.

890
01:16:18,476 --> 01:16:20,560
That's all over now, huh?

891
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:26,817
You know the people that make it, Ray?

892
01:16:27,193 --> 01:16:30,612
The ones that don't flatline
before the hospital?

893
01:16:33,032 --> 01:16:35,784
It's the ones that keep their eyes open.

894
01:16:36,619 --> 01:16:39,371
That keep looking at you. Keep thinking.

895
01:16:40,039 --> 01:16:42,457
They're the ones that survive.

896
01:16:43,918 --> 01:16:46,294
We can't lose our heads, Ray.

897
01:16:48,256 --> 01:16:49,548
Running.

898
01:16:50,258 --> 01:16:52,259
That's what'll kill you.

899
01:16:53,886 --> 01:16:56,555
And I'm dead set on living.

900
01:17:02,061 --> 01:17:04,187
Dead set on living...

901
01:17:06,941 --> 01:17:09,067
Thank you for taking us in.

902
01:17:16,284 --> 01:17:18,326
Not gonna be exterminated.

903
01:17:34,218 --> 01:17:37,345
It's okay. Come on.
I wanna show you something.

904
01:17:38,764 --> 01:17:41,683
We're gonna fight them, Ray.
They got to have a weakness.

905
01:17:41,767 --> 01:17:43,435
Come. Take a look.

906
01:17:51,444 --> 01:17:54,779
Somehow they killed a few of these
things in Osaka. That's what I heard.

907
01:17:54,864 --> 01:17:57,616
You telling me the Japanese
can figure it out, but we can't?

908
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,200
We can do this, Ray.

909
01:17:59,285 --> 01:18:01,161
We can do it. We can get them.

910
01:18:01,245 --> 01:18:03,121
We can figure it out.

911
01:18:03,623 --> 01:18:05,457
Stay right there.

912
01:18:24,894 --> 01:18:26,728
I have a daughter.

913
01:18:26,812 --> 01:18:28,229
Why did you bring us here?

914
01:18:28,314 --> 01:18:31,149
To fight them together, Ray.

915
01:18:31,233 --> 01:18:34,736
Now we'll be the ones coming up
from underground.

916
01:18:36,197 --> 01:18:38,281
When the time is right,

917
01:18:38,366 --> 01:18:41,576
take them by surprise,
the way they took us.

918
01:18:41,661 --> 01:18:43,912
Take them by surprise.

919
01:18:45,081 --> 01:18:46,539
We're right under their feet, Ray.

920
01:18:46,624 --> 01:18:49,501
Right here. Under their feet.

921
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:40,051
You miss your mommy?

922
01:19:40,761 --> 01:19:42,637
I had a little girl.

923
01:19:43,597 --> 01:19:45,056
Nearly your age.

924
01:19:46,225 --> 01:19:50,645
You know, if anything happens
to your daddy, I'll take care of you.

925
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:51,938
Rachel.

926
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:04,075
You don't have anything to say to her.
Do you understand?

927
01:20:04,744 --> 01:20:06,494
If you wanna talk to somebody,

928
01:20:06,579 --> 01:20:08,246
if you wanna ask a question,
you ask me.

929
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:10,832
What exactly is your plan, Ray?

930
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:13,835
I know what I'm gonna do.
How about you?

931
01:20:13,919 --> 01:20:17,088
You gonna sit here?
Wait for them to come get you?

932
01:20:17,423 --> 01:20:19,257
Is that your plan?

933
01:20:20,926 --> 01:20:23,136
Maybe you want to get caught.

934
01:20:23,471 --> 01:20:27,015
Couple days hiding in a basement
too much for you, I bet.

935
01:20:27,099 --> 01:20:28,641
You'll probably turn yourself right in.

936
01:20:32,938 --> 01:20:34,272
Listen.

937
01:20:35,649 --> 01:20:38,485
- It stopped.
- Maybe you'll be okay.

938
01:20:38,569 --> 01:20:41,446
Maybe you'll get lucky,
and they'll train you as their pet.

939
01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:44,574
You know, feed you,
train you how to do tricks.

940
01:20:44,658 --> 01:20:46,659
Will you shut up and listen?

941
01:22:50,451 --> 01:22:51,826
No.

942
01:27:15,841 --> 01:27:17,633
Give me that.

943
01:28:51,144 --> 01:28:52,937
You and me,

944
01:28:54,147 --> 01:28:57,233
I don't think we're on the same page.

945
01:29:33,729 --> 01:29:36,355
Ray. Ray.

946
01:29:36,523 --> 01:29:39,275
Ray. Ray. Ray!

947
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:40,901
Ray!

948
01:29:41,153 --> 01:29:44,071
Keep your voice down. Quiet!

949
01:30:25,489 --> 01:30:28,199
Not my blood. Not my blood.

950
01:30:31,161 --> 01:30:33,079
Not my blood.

951
01:30:34,039 --> 01:30:36,123
Not my...

952
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:37,958
Not

953
01:30:39,044 --> 01:30:40,378
my...

954
01:30:42,589 --> 01:30:51,806
Not my blood.

955
01:30:51,973 --> 01:30:53,641
- Not my blood.
- Stop it.

956
01:30:53,725 --> 01:30:56,560
- Stop it.
- Not my blood.

957
01:30:56,645 --> 01:30:58,270
You gotta be quiet.

958
01:30:58,355 --> 01:31:00,481
- You want them to hear you?
- They drink us.

959
01:31:00,565 --> 01:31:02,483
- Please, they'll hear you.
- They drink us.

960
01:31:02,567 --> 01:31:05,653
Then they spray us, like fertilizer.

961
01:31:05,737 --> 01:31:06,987
You gotta be quiet.

962
01:31:07,072 --> 01:31:09,907
- Drink us, and...
- They're gonna come back down here.

963
01:31:09,991 --> 01:31:13,160
Then they spit us out all over
the goddamn red weeds.

964
01:31:13,245 --> 01:31:15,079
Do you understand
what I'm gonna have to do?

965
01:31:15,205 --> 01:31:17,164
I can't let my daughter die
because of you.

966
01:31:17,249 --> 01:31:19,291
This tunnel will get us to the city.

967
01:31:19,376 --> 01:31:21,043
We'll have our own tunnels there.
Ready-made.

968
01:31:21,128 --> 01:31:22,586
- Stop it.
- Subway. See what I'm saying?

969
01:31:22,671 --> 01:31:24,171
- We can hide a whole army down there.
- Stop it.

970
01:31:24,256 --> 01:31:26,006
We'll go underground.
Sneak attacks at night.

971
01:31:26,091 --> 01:31:29,510
Stop. Stop. You stop it!

972
01:31:29,594 --> 01:31:32,847
We're the resistance, Ray.
They can't occupy this country.

973
01:31:32,931 --> 01:31:34,390
Occupations always fail.

974
01:31:34,474 --> 01:31:36,642
History's taught us that
a thousand times.

975
01:31:36,727 --> 01:31:38,936
This is our land.

976
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:42,481
We eat it, we breathe it,
only we can live on it.

977
01:31:42,566 --> 01:31:45,359
They can't survive here, Ray.
They weren't built for it.

978
01:31:46,111 --> 01:31:49,238
- They're gonna kill you, brother, not me!
- What are you doing?

979
01:31:49,322 --> 01:31:51,240
- Not my blood!
- What are you doing, Dad?

980
01:31:51,324 --> 01:31:54,535
Whatever you hear, don't take this off.

981
01:31:54,619 --> 01:31:56,287
- Dad?
- Rach?

982
01:31:56,371 --> 01:31:58,831
- Dad?
- What was that song?

983
01:31:58,915 --> 01:32:02,543
- That lullaby that I didn't know?
- Not my blood!

984
01:32:02,627 --> 01:32:04,712
- Hushabye Mountain?
- Yeah, sing it.

985
01:32:04,796 --> 01:32:07,548
- They can take you!
- Please, Rach, sing it.

986
01:32:07,632 --> 01:32:09,049
They can take you!

987
01:32:09,134 --> 01:32:10,634
A gentle breeze

988
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:13,345
- Your daughter! Not me!
- Don't stop.

989
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:15,347
On Hushabye Mountain

990
01:32:15,432 --> 01:32:16,891
- They're gonna kill you!
- That's my girl.

991
01:32:16,975 --> 01:32:21,645
Softly blows over Lullaby Bay

992
01:32:22,606 --> 01:32:23,856
Forget it! Tunnel!

993
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:26,942
It fills the sails

994
01:32:27,569 --> 01:32:30,237
Of boats that are waiting

995
01:32:31,907 --> 01:32:36,827
waiting to sail your worries away

996
01:32:38,538 --> 01:32:42,124
So close your eyes

997
01:32:42,793 --> 01:32:46,420
On Hushabye Mountain

998
01:32:46,505 --> 01:32:51,342
wave goodbye to cares of the day

999
01:32:52,052 --> 01:32:57,264
And watch your boat
from Hushabye Mountain

1000
01:32:57,766 --> 01:33:03,521
Sail far away from Lullaby Bay

1001
01:34:55,926 --> 01:34:59,637
Rachel?

1002
01:35:00,305 --> 01:35:02,264
Oh, my God, no.

1003
01:35:04,017 --> 01:35:08,979
Rachel? Rachel?

1004
01:35:20,241 --> 01:35:22,826
Rachel? Make some noise, baby.

1005
01:35:22,994 --> 01:35:27,665
Rachel?

1006
01:35:32,087 --> 01:35:34,838
Rachel? Just talk to me, baby. Come on.

1007
01:35:38,593 --> 01:35:45,432
Rachel?

1008
01:35:59,072 --> 01:36:03,033
Rachel!

1009
01:37:09,809 --> 01:37:12,686
No, no, no! No!

1010
01:37:44,219 --> 01:37:46,261
Hey!

1011
01:38:25,176 --> 01:38:27,261
Help!

1012
01:38:29,389 --> 01:38:32,266
What is happening?

1013
01:38:34,727 --> 01:38:35,853
Rachel!

1014
01:39:07,719 --> 01:39:09,636
Rachel.

1015
01:39:09,721 --> 01:39:12,347
Rachel. Rachel.

1016
01:39:13,349 --> 01:39:21,148
Rachel.

1017
01:39:22,025 --> 01:39:23,233
Dad.

1018
01:39:50,386 --> 01:39:53,305
No! No!

1019
01:39:53,389 --> 01:39:55,974
- Pull me! Pull me!
- No!

1020
01:40:02,482 --> 01:40:05,192
Pull! Pull!

1021
01:40:05,276 --> 01:40:07,903
- Pull me.
- Come on, pull!

1022
01:40:11,032 --> 01:40:13,450
- Dad!
- One, two, three...

1023
01:40:13,534 --> 01:40:15,244
- We got him!
- We got you.

1024
01:40:15,328 --> 01:40:16,912
Keep pulling!

1025
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:27,047
Everybody down!

1026
01:41:19,309 --> 01:41:21,184
Keep it moving, folks.

1027
01:41:23,771 --> 01:41:26,189
Keep going, sir. Keep moving.

1028
01:41:26,524 --> 01:41:29,067
- Oh, God.
- I don't know what's going on.

1029
01:41:30,862 --> 01:41:32,821
Hold Grandma's hand.

1030
01:41:34,949 --> 01:41:38,410
Let's go, folks. Keep moving forward.

1031
01:41:48,504 --> 01:41:50,297
Put that down.

1032
01:41:52,759 --> 01:41:55,635
Right this way, ma'am.
Right this way. Thank you.

1033
01:42:03,811 --> 01:42:06,772
To the left, there, ma'am,
just to your left. Thank you.

1034
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:11,026
What happened to it?

1035
01:42:14,906 --> 01:42:16,490
It's dying.

1036
01:42:18,951 --> 01:42:20,660
Keep moving forward.

1037
01:42:31,381 --> 01:42:32,923
Keep moving. It's all right.

1038
01:42:33,007 --> 01:42:34,591
You can pass on through. Move along.

1039
01:42:34,675 --> 01:42:35,759
- What happened here?
- I don't know.

1040
01:42:35,843 --> 01:42:37,844
Something's happening to them.
Please, keep moving.

1041
01:42:37,929 --> 01:42:39,471
- Let's go, move out.
- Let's go, people.

1042
01:42:39,972 --> 01:42:43,100
- Something's happening to them.
- Go. Go, just keep moving, sir.

1043
01:42:43,226 --> 01:42:44,267
Let's go, sir. Let's go.

1044
01:42:44,352 --> 01:42:45,811
Do not stop. Keep moving. Keep moving.

1045
01:42:45,895 --> 01:42:47,229
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What's happened here?

1046
01:42:47,313 --> 01:42:49,856
- Did you guys take it down?
- No, sir, it was behaving erratically,

1047
01:42:49,941 --> 01:42:52,651
walking in circles, then it went down
on its own about an hour ago.

1048
01:42:52,735 --> 01:42:55,862
Now, please, let's go. Let's go.
Keep moving. Come on. Don't stop.

1049
01:42:55,947 --> 01:42:58,031
Do not stop! Let's go! Thank you!

1050
01:42:59,534 --> 01:43:01,451
How is it dead all by itself?

1051
01:43:01,619 --> 01:43:04,246
- Rachel, I'm not sure.
- Coming through.

1052
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:07,416
Coming through. Make a hole.
Coming through.

1053
01:43:27,478 --> 01:43:29,354
Calm down.
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

1054
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:31,022
Calm down and get in the tunnel.
Calm down.

1055
01:43:31,107 --> 01:43:32,983
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

1056
01:43:44,829 --> 01:43:47,998
Everybody, calm down.
Get in the tunnel.

1057
01:43:48,082 --> 01:43:51,001
Everybody, on the other side
of the tracks!

1058
01:43:54,505 --> 01:43:55,797
Look at the birds!

1059
01:43:55,882 --> 01:43:57,424
I can't hear you!

1060
01:43:57,508 --> 01:44:00,343
Look at the goddamn birds!

1061
01:44:03,347 --> 01:44:05,557
- No shield!
- I can't hear!

1062
01:44:05,641 --> 01:44:07,476
No shield!

1063
01:44:11,481 --> 01:44:13,857
The Javelin's the key!

1064
01:44:13,941 --> 01:44:16,735
Load the Gustav!
It's gonna be a tough kill!

1065
01:44:16,903 --> 01:44:18,445
Let's go!

1066
01:44:20,281 --> 01:44:21,448
It's safer in here.

1067
01:44:21,532 --> 01:44:23,492
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1068
01:44:23,576 --> 01:44:25,202
Bring out the Javelin!

1069
01:44:34,003 --> 01:44:36,338
Clear! Go from behind! Clear!

1070
01:44:45,389 --> 01:44:47,974
- Let me know when you're tracking!
- Tracking!

1071
01:44:48,059 --> 01:44:49,601
- You got a lock?
- I got a lock!

1072
01:44:49,685 --> 01:44:51,394
Fire the Javelin!

1073
01:44:58,110 --> 01:45:00,487
- I got a lock!
- Fire the Javelin!

1074
01:45:03,658 --> 01:45:05,116
Fire!

1075
01:45:19,715 --> 01:45:21,508
It's okay.

1076
01:45:22,677 --> 01:45:24,594
I love you.

1077
01:45:24,762 --> 01:45:27,097
- It's okay. You're gonna be okay.
- Let's go!

1078
01:45:28,599 --> 01:45:31,017
Keep those civilians out of there.

1079
01:45:31,102 --> 01:45:34,938
Back. Stay back!
Come on, folks, back up!

1080
01:45:39,777 --> 01:45:43,196
Come on, guys, get on the line.
Get up there now.

1081
01:45:43,281 --> 01:45:46,199
- Stay back. Stay right here, huh?
- Hold on right there.

1082
01:45:52,456 --> 01:45:55,250
- It's opening.
- It's opening. Keep them back.

1083
01:46:34,540 --> 01:46:36,124
Clear!

1084
01:46:36,208 --> 01:46:39,628
No, keep them back. Keep them back.
Come on, stay back.

1085
01:47:15,206 --> 01:47:16,706
Mom!

1086
01:47:43,943 --> 01:47:45,860
Thank you.

1087
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:11,010
- Robbie?
- Robbie?

1088
01:48:17,518 --> 01:48:24,190
Hi, Dad.

1089
01:48:58,517 --> 01:49:00,894
From the moment the invaders arrived,

1090
01:49:00,978 --> 01:49:04,564
breathed our air, ate and drank,

1091
01:49:04,648 --> 01:49:06,316
they were doomed.

1092
01:49:07,359 --> 01:49:10,570
They were undone, destroyed,

1093
01:49:10,654 --> 01:49:13,948
after all of man's weapons
and devices had failed,

1094
01:49:14,241 --> 01:49:19,245
by the tiniest creatures that God
in his wisdom put upon this Earth.

1095
01:49:20,247 --> 01:49:24,042
By the toll of a billion deaths,
man had earned his immunity,

1096
01:49:24,126 --> 01:49:28,713
his right to survive among
this planet's infinite organisms.

1097
01:49:29,799 --> 01:49:33,510
And that right is ours
against all challenges,

1098
01:49:33,844 --> 01:56:05,735
for neither do men live, nor die, in vain.
