1
00:02:13,427 --> 00:02:14,428
Stop now.

2
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:17,055
Tell me where it is.

3
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:26,565
You and your brethren possess
what is not rightfully yours.

4
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:31,069
I don't know what you are talking about.

5
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:34,114
Is it a secret you will die for?

6
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:37,159
- Please.
- As you wish.

7
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:39,411
Wait!

8
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:45,584
My God, forgive me.

9
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:49,212
In the sacristy,

10
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:53,133
the church of Saint-Sulpice,
is the Rose Line.

11
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:55,135
Beneath the Rose.

12
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:58,972
Thank you.

13
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:34,132
Thank you.

14
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,134
Thank you.

15
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,234
Symbols are a language
that can help us understand our past.

16
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:56,947
As the saying goes,
a picture says a thousand words,

17
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,033
but which words?

18
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:04,746
Interpret for me, please, this symbol.
First thing that comes to mind. Anybody?

19
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,165
- Hatred, racism.
- Ku Klux Klan.

20
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,671
Yes, yes, interesting.
But they would disagree with you in Spain.

21
00:04:12,796 --> 00:04:16,091
There, they are robes worn by priests.

22
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,677
Now this symbol. Anyone?

23
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:19,886
Evil.

24
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:22,389
In English, please.

25
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:23,723
Devil's pitchfork.

26
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:26,017
Poor, poor Poseidon.

27
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:28,311
That is his trident.

28
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:32,190
A symbol of power
to millions of the ancients.

29
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:33,442
Now this symbol.

30
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:36,653
- Madonna and child.
- Faith. Christianity.

31
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:40,365
No. No, it's the pagan god Horus
and his mother Isis

32
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:43,410
centuries before the birth of Christ.

33
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:47,289
Understanding our past determines actively

34
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:50,584
our ability to understand the present.

35
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:54,838
So how do we sift truth from belief?

36
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:58,884
How do we write our own histories,
personally or culturally,

37
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:01,136
and thereby define ourselves?

38
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:06,016
How do we penetrate years, centuries,
of historical distortion

39
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:09,227
to find original truth?

40
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:12,731
Tonight, this will be our quest.

41
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:15,859
My son is a student of yours at Harvard.

42
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,320
- Michael Culp? He adores you.
- Yeah.

43
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,489
He says you're the best teacher
he's ever had.

44
00:05:20,572 --> 00:05:24,367
Ms. Culp, I think I already gave
Michael an A-minus.

45
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,369
He told me. Thank you.

46
00:05:26,453 --> 00:05:27,913
Mr. Langdon?

47
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:29,915
Hi.

48
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:31,416
Bonjour, Professor.

49
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,422
I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ.
A kind of French FBI.

50
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,759
Will you take a look at this photo, please?

51
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:43,845
My police chief, Captain Fache, had hoped,

52
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:47,349
considering your expertise
and the markings on the body,

53
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:48,934
you might assist us.

54
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,694
Will you excuse me a moment?

55
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,200
I was supposed to have drinks with him
earlier this evening.

56
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,451
Yes, we know.

57
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:09,955
We found your name in his daily planner.

58
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:13,875
He never showed. I waited for over an hour.

59
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,798
Why would someone do this to him?

60
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:22,551
You misunderstand, Professor.

61
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:25,720
He was shot, yes.

62
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:28,557
But what you see in the photograph,

63
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,101
Monsieur Saunière did to himself.

64
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:38,650
Teacher, all four are dead.

65
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:42,571
The sénéchaux and the Grand Master himself.

66
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:45,824
Then I assume you have the location.

67
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:49,119
Confirmed by all.

68
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:51,705
Independently.

69
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:56,835
I had feared the Priory's penchant
for secrecy might prevail.

70
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:04,467
The prospect of death is strong motivation.

71
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:10,307
It is here.

72
00:07:10,557 --> 00:07:13,018
In Paris, Teacher.

73
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:19,399
It hides beneath the Rose in Saint-Sulpice.

74
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:22,652
You will go forth, Silas.

75
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,104
I chastise my body.

76
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,977
Captain Fache is waiting for you.

77
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:28,611
Okay.

78
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:41,332
- Mr. Langdon.
- Yes.

79
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,793
I'm Captain Bezu Fache.

80
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:46,337
You like our pyramid?

81
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:47,505
It's magnificent.

82
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,216
A scar on the face of Paris.

83
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,178
After me, please.

84
00:10:00,894 --> 00:10:03,021
It's the pairing of those two pyramids.

85
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:04,939
It's unique.

86
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:07,192
The two are geometric echoes.

87
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:08,359
Fascinating.

88
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,616
I'm not sure how much help
I'm gonna be here this evening.

89
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:17,952
How well did you know the curator?

90
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:19,329
Not very well.

91
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:22,999
Frankly, I was surprised
when he contacted me.

92
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:33,426
Could we take the stairs?

93
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:51,402
So Saunière requested tonight's meeting.

94
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:52,612
Yes.

95
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:54,280
How? Did he call you?

96
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:59,202
E-mail. He heard I was in Paris.

97
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:03,456
- Had something to discuss.
- What?

98
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:11,214
You seem uncomfortable.

99
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:27,063
The Grande Galerie.
This is where you found the body.

100
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:28,940
How would you know that?

101
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:33,027
I recognize the parquet floor
from the Polaroid.

102
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:34,654
It's unmistakable.

103
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:45,290
Dear God.

104
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:51,671
Let's cover the talking points again,
Your Eminence.

105
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:54,841
Many call Opus Dei a brainwashing cult.

106
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:57,677
Others, an ultraconservative
Christian secret society.

107
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,221
Obviously, some people fear
what they don't understand.

108
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:02,724
Perhaps a less defensive
tack, Your Eminence.

109
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:04,934
The press continue to be harsh with us.

110
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:10,690
We are not Cafeteria Catholics.

111
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:13,318
We don't pick and choose
which rules to follow.

112
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:16,029
We follow doctrine. Rigorously.

113
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:20,909
Does doctrine necessarily include
vows of chastity, tithing,

114
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:24,120
and atonement for sins
through self-flagellation and the cilice?

115
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:28,625
Many of our followers are married.
Many of them have families.

116
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,669
Only a small proportion
choose to live ascetic lives.

117
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:34,839
- Why are some media...
- That will be all, Michael, thank you.

118
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:36,591
Aringarosa.

119
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:41,512
Silas has succeeded. The legend is true.

120
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:43,723
It hides beneath the Rose.

121
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:47,060
My part of our bargain is nearly fulfilled.

122
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:50,688
I meet the council in an hour.

123
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:54,692
I will have your money tonight, Teacher.

124
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:57,487
The Vitruvian Man.

125
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,198
It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's
most famous sketches.

126
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:02,867
And the star on his skin?

127
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:06,037
- A pentacle.
- And its meaning?

128
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,539
The pentacle is a pagan religious icon.

129
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:10,792
Devil worship.

130
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:15,213
No. No, no, no. The pentacle before that.

131
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:18,424
This is a symbol for Venus.

132
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:21,511
It represents the female
half of all things.

133
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:24,555
You are telling me
that Saunière's last act on earth

134
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,726
was to draw a goddess symbol
on his chest? Why?

135
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:33,439
Captain Fache,
obviously I can't tell you why.

136
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:38,611
I can tell you he, as well as anyone,
knows the meaning of this symbol,

137
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,989
and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil.

138
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:42,573
- Is that so?
- Yes.

139
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:46,869
Then what do you make of this?

140
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:51,416
"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint."

141
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,752
It's a phrase.
Doesn't mean anything, not to me.

142
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,007
What would you do if you had
such limited time to send a message?

143
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:05,054
Well, I suppose I'd try
to identify my killer.

144
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,056
Precisely.

145
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,392
Precisely.

146
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:10,601
So, Professor...

147
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:14,230
Officer Neveu.

148
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,940
Please, pardon the interruption.

149
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:17,025
This is not the time.

150
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,444
I received the crime-scene jpegs
at headquarters...

151
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,446
...and I've deciphered the code.

152
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,364
It's a Fibonacci sequence.

153
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:24,991
That's the code Saunière left on the floor.

154
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:26,075
Fibonacci?

155
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:28,411
Headquarters sent me to explain, captain.

156
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:29,954
It is the Fibonacci sequence.

157
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:31,372
The numbers are out of order.

158
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:34,459
But before that, I have an urgent
message for Professor Langdon.

159
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:35,585
Right?

160
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:37,420
Pardon me?

161
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:42,925
I'm Sophie Neveu, French
police, Cryptology.

162
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:45,053
Your embassy called Division.

163
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:54,145
I'm sorry, monsieur, they said
it was a matter of life and death.

164
00:14:55,063 --> 00:14:58,024
This is the number
of your embassy's messaging service.

165
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,443
Well, thank you.

166
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,994
Hello, you've reached
the home of Sophie Neveu.

167
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:14,082
Miss Neveu? This...

168
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:15,416
No. That's the right number.

169
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,919
You have to dial an access code
to pick up your messages.

170
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:19,087
But I'm getting...

171
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,048
It's a three-digit code.
It's on the paper I gave you.

172
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,435
Professor Langdon,
do not react to this message.

173
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,105
You must follow my directions very closely

174
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:40,399
and, above all,
reveal nothing to Captain Fache.

175
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:42,527
You are in grave danger.

176
00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:57,500
Church of Saint-Sulpice.

177
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,377
Good evening, Sister.

178
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:04,173
I need you to show someone
our church tonight.

179
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:06,008
Of course, Father.

180
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:08,219
But so late?

181
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,471
Wouldn't tomorrow...?

182
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:15,393
This is a request from an
important bishop of Opus Dei.

183
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:18,563
It would be my pleasure.

184
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,590
There's been an accident. A friend.

185
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:49,135
- I have to fly home in the morning.
- I see.

186
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,179
Is there a restroom I could use?

187
00:16:51,262 --> 00:16:53,514
I just wanna splash some water on my face.

188
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:54,765
Yes.

189
00:16:56,893 --> 00:16:59,687
She said it is meaningless.

190
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,273
A mathematical joke.

191
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:05,109
Is it meaningless?

192
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,864
I'll take another look when I come back.

193
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:16,162
I'm sorry. Of course.

194
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:32,345
Do you have a message from Saunière?

195
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:34,680
What are you talking about?

196
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,266
Crazy old man.

197
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:40,061
You have me confused with someone else.

198
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,271
- I came here to...
- Check your jacket pocket.

199
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:44,857
Just look.

200
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:50,655
GPS tracking dot.

201
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,991
Accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe.

202
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:57,119
The agent who picked you up
slipped it into your jacket

203
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,165
in case you tried to run.

204
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,336
We have you on a little leash, Professor.

205
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,672
Why would I try to run?
I didn't do anything.

206
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:11,926
So, what do you think about
the fourth line of text

207
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,887
Fache wiped clean before you arrived?

208
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:24,605
He brought you here to force
a confession, Professor Langdon.

209
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:31,028
He's still in there? What's he doing?

210
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:34,615
Fache isn't even looking
for other suspects, okay?

211
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,200
He is sure you're guilty.

212
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:42,415
When did Saunière contact you?

213
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:43,958
- Today?
- Yes, yes.

214
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,043
What time? What time?

215
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:48,337
At 3:00. Around 3:00. 3:00.

216
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:52,216
We call Fache "the Bull."
Once he starts, he doesn't stop.

217
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,636
He can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case.

218
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,140
And by then whatever Saunière
wanted you to tell me will be useless.

219
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:01,559
Lady, stop it! Just stop!

220
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:03,477
Who are you?

221
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:10,234
Look at the letters.

222
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:12,945
"P.S."

223
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,031
P.S., postscript.

224
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:19,243
"Princess Sophie." Silly, I know.

225
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:22,079
But I was only a girl
when I lived with him.

226
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:28,044
Jacques Saunière was my grandfather.

227
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:36,552
Apparently, it was his dying wish
that we meet.

228
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:40,681
If you help me understand why

229
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:44,435
I will get you to your embassy,
where we cannot arrest you.

230
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:48,439
Fache was never gonna let me
just stroll out of here, was he?

231
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:50,441
No.

232
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,154
If we are to get away from here,
we must find another way.

233
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,248
What exactly do you propose?

234
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,636
Saunière was reading his book.

235
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:21,013
"Blood trail."

236
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,850
Excuse me, captain.

237
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:27,103
We have a problem.

238
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:30,314
Headquarters didn't send Sophie Neveu.

239
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:33,734
What?

240
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:37,321
Captain, look at this.

241
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,157
He jumped!

242
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,826
Shit.

243
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:47,164
He's moving again. And fast.

244
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:49,917
He must be in a car.

245
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:55,297
He's going south on Pont du Carrousel.

246
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,307
Bastard.

247
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:31,584
That cop will check the whole lower floor.

248
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:37,840
I will only take a moment.

249
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,592
Of course.

250
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:50,478
He is much older than I remember.

251
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:05,618
I hadn't seen or spoken to him
in a very long time.

252
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:18,714
He phoned my office today. Several times.

253
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:22,927
He said it was a matter of life and death.

254
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:26,764
I thought it was another trick
to get back in touch.

255
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,228
It seems when he couldn't speak to me,

256
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:35,481
he reached out to you.

257
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,917
- Wait a minute.
- Professor?

258
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:59,880
This is wrong. Yeah. See? This is wrong.

259
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:05,135
The Fibonacci numbers only make sense
when they're in order.

260
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:06,762
These are scrambled.

261
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:10,599
If he was trying to reach out,
maybe he was doing it in code.

262
00:23:10,683 --> 00:23:12,560
Would you hold this, please?

263
00:23:15,104 --> 00:23:16,981
This phrase is meaningless.

264
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:23,612
Unless you assume these letters
are out of order too.

265
00:23:23,696 --> 00:23:24,863
An anagram.

266
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,419
You have eidetic memory?

267
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:42,256
Not quite.
But I can pretty much remember what I see.

268
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,571
Anagram is right.

269
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:09,533
"O, Draconian devil. Oh,
lame saint" becomes

270
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:12,244
"Leonardo da Vinci. The Mona Lisa."

271
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:16,248
Professor, the Mona Lisa
is right over here.

272
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:27,718
Look at this. He must have
thrown it from the window.

273
00:24:28,052 --> 00:24:29,678
Smart to hit the truck.

274
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:33,599
What, you admire him now?

275
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:37,311
We're stupid. Who did
we leave at the museum?

276
00:24:37,478 --> 00:24:40,230
Ledoux? Get him on the radio!

277
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:43,525
Her smile is in the lower
spatial frequencies.

278
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:47,404
The horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right.

279
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:48,614
Why?

280
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:52,201
Well, see, she appears larger
from the left than on the right.

281
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:55,454
Historically, the left was female,
the right was male.

282
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,247
There. Blood.

283
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:06,840
Hey.

284
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:11,136
"So dark the con of man."

285
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:15,265
No. It doesn't say that.

286
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,768
Is it another anagram? Can you break it?

287
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,150
Professor, hurry. Hurry!

288
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:29,780
Moon. Sermon. Charms.

289
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:33,951
Demons. Omens. Codes. Monks. Ranks. Rocks.

290
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,285
Madonna of the Rocks.

291
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,121
Da Vinci.

292
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:49,258
Careful. Careful.

293
00:25:56,682 --> 00:26:00,561
This can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.

294
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,060
It was Saunière's.

295
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:45,647
I remember finding it
once when I was a girl.

296
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,734
He'd promised he'd give it to me one day.

297
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,862
Have you ever heard
those words before, Sophie?

298
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:53,447
"So dark the con of man"?

299
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,157
No. Have you?

300
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,869
When you were a child,
were you aware of any secret gatherings?

301
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:02,372
Anything ritualistic in nature?

302
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:05,793
Meetings your grandfather
would've wanted kept secret?

303
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:09,505
Was there ever any talk of something
called the Priory of Sion?

304
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,549
The what? Why are you asking these things?

305
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:15,803
The Priory of Sion is a myth.

306
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:18,138
One of the world's oldest
and most secret societies,

307
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:22,726
with leaders like Sir Isaac Newton,
da Vinci himself.

308
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,895
The fleur-de-lis is their crest.

309
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:27,689
They're guardians of a secret
they supposedly refer to

310
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:30,025
as "the dark con of man."

311
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:31,985
But what secret?

312
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:37,825
The Priory of Sion protects
the source of God's power on Earth.

313
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,627
I can't do this by myself.

314
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:52,214
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
That's my embassy.

315
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:53,382
Please.

316
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:55,926
- Even if we could get out of this...
- Okay.

317
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:36,425
No, no, no. You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make it!

318
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,392
Well, that was...

319
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:56,028
We need to get out of sight.

320
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,961
Christ, give me strength.

321
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:29,519
You are a ghost.

322
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:33,148
Christ, give me strength.

323
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:13,063
Stealing in a house of God!

324
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,412
You are an angel.

325
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:32,916
Christ, give me strength.

326
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,569
You have powerful friends.

327
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,448
Bishop Aringarosa has been kind to me.

328
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:09,036
I could not miss this chance
to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.

329
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,372
A pity you couldn't wait for morning.

330
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:14,458
The light is not ideal.

331
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:19,546
Tell me, Sister, please, of the Rose Line.

332
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:25,135
A rose line is any line that goes from
the North to South Poles.

333
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,140
Set into the streets of Paris,
135 brass markers

334
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:33,101
mark the world's first prime meridian

335
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:35,604
which passed through this very church.

336
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,522
It hides beneath the Rose.

337
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:38,899
I'm sorry?

338
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:41,568
Sister.

339
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,574
I do not want to keep you.
I will show myself out.

340
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:51,912
I insist.

341
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:59,086
May the peace of the Lord be with you.

342
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,130
And with you.

343
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:20,857
They found Neveu's car
abandoned at the train station.

344
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:26,530
And two tickets to Brussels paid for
with Langdon's credit card.

345
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,198
A decoy, I'm sure.

346
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:30,867
All the same, send an
officer to the station.

347
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:33,703
Question all the taxi drivers.
I'll put this on the wire.

348
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:36,748
Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.

349
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:40,877
I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.

350
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:44,005
Robert Langdon is guilty.

351
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,224
This is the Bois de Boulogne?

352
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:57,144
We should be safe in this park
for a few minutes.

353
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:50,405
Stay here.

354
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:53,450
Police.

355
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:56,286
What do you want?

356
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,919
Fifty euros for all your stuff.

357
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:08,298
Go and get something to eat.

358
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:30,153
Did it ever occur to you
that could be dangerous?

359
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:33,448
No. And now we have a place to think.

360
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,909
Any ideas, Professor?

361
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:40,664
You could've just handed me
a piece of a UFO from Area 51.

362
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,834
"What's the next step?"

363
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:47,003
With him, it's always,

364
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:50,173
"Sophie, what's the next step?"

365
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,425
Puzzles.

366
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:53,843
Codes.

367
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:55,929
A treasure hunt.

368
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:01,768
To find his killer.

369
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:09,442
Maybe there is something
about this Priory of Sion.

370
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:10,652
I hope not.

371
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:15,699
Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.
They were butchered by the Church.

372
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:19,244
It all started over a thousand years ago
when a French king

373
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:21,746
conquered the holy city of Jerusalem.

374
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,500
This crusade, one of the most
massive and sweeping in history,

375
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:29,212
was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood,

376
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:30,463
the Priory of Sion

377
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:34,843
and their military arm,
the Knights Templar.

378
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:38,430
But the Templars were created
to protect the Holy Land.

379
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:42,642
That was a cover to hide their true goal,
according to this myth.

380
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:46,187
Supposedly the invasion
was to find an artifact

381
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,189
lost since the time of Christ.

382
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:52,402
An artifact, it was said,
the Church would kill to possess.

383
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:55,488
Did they find it, this buried treasure?

384
00:35:56,698 --> 00:35:57,949
Put it this way.

385
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:00,493
One day the Templars
simply stopped searching.

386
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:04,414
They quit the Holy Land
and traveled directly to Rome.

387
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:06,916
Whether they blackmailed the papacy

388
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,336
or the Church bought their silence,
no one knows.

389
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:13,590
But it is a fact the papacy
declared these Priory knights,

390
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:17,302
these Knights Templar, of limitless power.

391
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:21,765
By the 1300s,
the Templars had grown too powerful.

392
00:36:21,848 --> 00:36:23,266
Too threatening.

393
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:25,685
So the Vatican issued secret orders

394
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:28,897
to be opened simultaneously
all across Europe.

395
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:33,526
The Pope had declared
the Knights Templar Satan worshipers

396
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:37,822
and said God had charged him
with cleansing the Earth of these heretics.

397
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:40,658
The plan went off like clockwork.

398
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,995
The Templars were all but exterminated.

399
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,291
The date was October 13, 1307. A Friday.

400
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:50,251
Friday the 13th.

401
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:54,130
The Pope sent troops
to claim the Priory's treasure,

402
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:55,799
but they found nothing.

403
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:59,427
The few surviving Knights of the Priory
had vanished,

404
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:02,555
and the search for
their sacred artifact began again.

405
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,017
What artifact?
I've never heard about any of this.

406
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:08,478
Yes, you have.

407
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:10,605
Almost everyone on Earth has.

408
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:14,234
You just know it as the Holy Grail.

409
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:23,827
Please, Saunière thought he knew
the location of the Holy Grail?

410
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:26,830
Maybe more than that.

411
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:30,875
This cross and the flower,
this could be very old. But look.

412
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:35,505
This metal here underneath is much newer,
and there's a modern ID stamp.

413
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:37,757
"Haxo 24."

414
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:43,763
And these dots.
These dots are read by a laser.

415
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:47,684
This is more than a pendant.
This is a key your grandfather left you.

416
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:50,019
He left us, Professor.

417
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:56,151
And vingt-quatre Haxo,
it's not an ID stamp.

418
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,528
It's a street address.

419
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,034
This is Jacques Saunière.

420
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,246
Please leave a message after the tone.

421
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:11,332
Please, Monsieur Saunière,
pick up the phone.

422
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,084
This is Sandrine Bieil.

423
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,587
I have called the list.

424
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:17,922
I fear the other guardians are dead.

425
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:20,425
The lie has been told.

426
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:22,677
The floor panel has been broken.

427
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:26,764
Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.
I beg you.

428
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:28,558
Job 38, verse 11.

429
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:32,270
Do you know it, Sister?

430
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:35,815
Job 38:11.

431
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:41,738
"Hitherto shalt thou come but no further."

432
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:43,907
"But no further."

433
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:49,913
Do you mock me?

434
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,918
Where is the keystone?

435
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:57,670
I do not know.

436
00:38:58,713 --> 00:38:59,839
No.

437
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:04,511
You are a sister of the Church

438
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:10,350
and yet you serve them, the Priory.

439
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:14,354
Jesus had but one true message, that...

440
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:30,078
Come, you saints of God.

441
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:33,623
Hasten, angels of the Lord.

442
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:37,126
To receive her soul.

443
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:42,131
And bring her to the sight of the Almighty.

444
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,318
Welcome, Bishop.

445
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:05,238
This council is convened.

446
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:17,250
Our words shall never pass these walls.

447
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:22,005
What business, say you?

448
00:40:23,965 --> 00:40:26,092
As you know, my request for funds...

449
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:30,013
Yes, 20 million euro
in untraceable bearer bonds.

450
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,975
A tad more than petty cash.
Wouldn't you say, Bishop?

451
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:40,398
I only offer a route to the renewal
of faith for all men.

452
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:41,941
How humble.

453
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:44,819
Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa.

454
00:40:44,902 --> 00:40:46,446
How dare you presume to...

455
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:48,239
I do not presume, I act!

456
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,619
The Vatican's unwillingness to support us
is both impious and cowardly.

457
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:57,040
Blood is being spilled because true
Christian values lie in ruins. No more!

458
00:40:57,707 --> 00:41:00,918
This council has forgotten
its very purpose.

459
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:08,468
Tonight, the Grail will be destroyed.

460
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:12,096
The Priory's few remaining members
will be silenced.

461
00:41:20,313 --> 00:41:24,567
I was contacted by a man
who calls himself only "the Teacher."

462
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:29,697
Two prostitutes identified
Langdon and Neveu...

463
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:32,075
...getting into a taxi
in the Bois de Boulogne.

464
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:43,920
Because of your expertise?

465
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:46,673
- I'm sorry?
- About the Priory.

466
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:49,217
Do you think that's why
Saunière sought you out?

467
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:53,012
I can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it.

468
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:57,183
Actually, I didn't think
he liked me very much.

469
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,396
Once made a joke at my expense.
Got a big laugh out of it.

470
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:02,814
What was it?

471
00:42:15,993 --> 00:42:17,787
How may I help you?

472
00:42:23,668 --> 00:42:25,962
The door to the right, please.

473
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:47,108
Good evening. I am André Vernet,
the night manager.

474
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:51,863
I take it this is your first visit
to our establishment?

475
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:53,781
Yes.

476
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,825
Understood.

477
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:58,077
Keys are often passed on

478
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:01,873
and first-time users
are sometimes uncertain of protocol.

479
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:06,502
Keys are essentially
numbered Swiss accounts.

480
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:10,631
Often willed through generations.

481
00:43:13,551 --> 00:43:16,012
Is it yours, mademoiselle?

482
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:21,142
The shortest safety-deposit-box lease
is 50 years.

483
00:43:22,143 --> 00:43:24,187
And what's your longest account?

484
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:25,980
Quite a bit longer.

485
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:29,066
Technologies change, keys are updated.

486
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:36,240
Once the computer confirms your key,

487
00:43:36,324 --> 00:43:39,368
enter your account number
and your box is retrieved.

488
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:42,538
The room is yours, as long as you like.

489
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:50,755
What if I lost track of my account number?

490
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:52,799
How might I recover it?

491
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:57,762
I'm afraid each key is paired
with a 10-digit number

492
00:43:57,845 --> 00:43:59,972
known only to the account bearer.

493
00:44:00,056 --> 00:44:02,141
I hope you manage to remember it.

494
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:05,394
A single wrong entry disables the system.

495
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,569
- Ten.
- Ten.

496
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:16,197
Your grandfather's Fibonacci sequence.

497
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:21,661
Scrambled, unscrambled?

498
00:44:22,578 --> 00:44:23,913
Unscrambled.

499
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,249
It's your key.

500
00:44:30,962 --> 00:44:34,674
Funny, I don't even like history.

501
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:42,306
I've never seen much good
come from looking to the past.

502
00:44:49,772 --> 00:44:51,274
Moment of truth.

503
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:38,487
My God. I don't believe this.

504
00:45:38,905 --> 00:45:40,072
A rose.

505
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:46,746
The rose was a symbol for the Holy Grail.

506
00:45:49,624 --> 00:45:51,584
Forgive the intrusion.

507
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:54,795
I'm afraid the police arrived
more quickly than anticipated.

508
00:45:55,922 --> 00:45:57,673
You must follow me, please.

509
00:45:57,882 --> 00:45:59,258
For your own safety.

510
00:45:59,634 --> 00:46:01,344
You knew they were coming?

511
00:46:01,427 --> 00:46:04,263
My guard alerted me to your status
when you arrived.

512
00:46:04,347 --> 00:46:07,350
Yours is one of our oldest
and highest-level accounts.

513
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:09,685
It includes a safe-passage clause.

514
00:46:09,852 --> 00:46:11,020
Safe passage?

515
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:15,191
If you would step inside, please.
Time is of the essence.

516
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,570
In there?

517
00:46:34,752 --> 00:46:36,545
Hey, is there a problem?

518
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:39,423
Good evening, sir. Police.

519
00:46:39,882 --> 00:46:43,970
I just drive from here to Zurich.
Not French, English?

520
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,346
- English?
- Yes.

521
00:46:46,722 --> 00:46:49,392
We are looking for two criminals.

522
00:46:50,685 --> 00:46:53,562
You came to the right place.
They're all criminals here.

523
00:46:55,356 --> 00:46:57,692
Would you mind opening the hold?

524
00:46:58,234 --> 00:47:01,862
Please. You think they trust us,
the wages I get paid?

525
00:47:01,946 --> 00:47:03,948
You don't have keys to your own truck?

526
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:06,742
It's armored.
Keys get sent to the destination.

527
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:08,995
You mind? I'm on a schedule here.

528
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,919
And do all the drivers wear a Rolex?

529
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,504
What?

530
00:47:20,923 --> 00:47:22,591
This piece of shit.

531
00:47:22,675 --> 00:47:24,552
Forty euros in Barbés.

532
00:47:24,635 --> 00:47:25,761
Yours for 35.

533
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:27,513
No, no, no.

534
00:47:27,596 --> 00:47:29,432
- Thirty.
- No. It's okay, it's okay.

535
00:47:29,557 --> 00:47:32,309
- Come on, 30?
- I said, no!

536
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:34,020
Move along!

537
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:48,659
Now we wait.

538
00:47:48,743 --> 00:47:51,454
The Teacher will call and tell me
where to deliver the money.

539
00:47:51,537 --> 00:47:54,874
You have put tremendous faith
in this Teacher of yours.

540
00:47:54,957 --> 00:47:59,378
Yes, I have. And I have given
him an angel to do his will.

541
00:47:59,879 --> 00:48:03,257
For surely there is no better soldier
for God than my Silas.

542
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:08,054
I firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins...

543
00:48:08,262 --> 00:48:13,059
...to do penance and to amend my life.

544
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,351
Amen.

545
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,327
The Holy Grail.

546
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:37,083
A magic cup.
The source of God's power on earth.

547
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:38,459
It's nonsense.

548
00:48:39,418 --> 00:48:41,337
You don't believe in God.

549
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:43,339
No.

550
00:48:44,298 --> 00:48:45,800
Just people.

551
00:48:47,093 --> 00:48:49,678
Sometimes that they can be kind.

552
00:48:51,055 --> 00:48:53,641
Are you a God-fearing man, Professor?

553
00:48:55,184 --> 00:48:57,019
I was raised a Catholic.

554
00:48:57,686 --> 00:48:59,522
Well, that's not really an answer.

555
00:49:02,149 --> 00:49:03,859
Professor, are you okay?

556
00:49:04,902 --> 00:49:06,529
Go ahead, open it.

557
00:49:07,363 --> 00:49:08,405
Go on.

558
00:49:15,538 --> 00:49:16,872
A cryptex.

559
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:20,668
They are used to keep secrets.

560
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,587
It's da Vinci's design.

561
00:49:24,338 --> 00:49:27,758
You write the information
on a papyrus scroll

562
00:49:27,842 --> 00:49:32,930
which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar.

563
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:36,308
If you force it open, the vial breaks,

564
00:49:36,392 --> 00:49:39,061
vinegar dissolves papyrus,

565
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,566
and your secret is lost forever.

566
00:49:43,941 --> 00:49:46,110
The only way to access the information

567
00:49:46,193 --> 00:49:51,824
is to spell out the password with these
five dials, each with 26 letters.

568
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:56,745
That's 12 million possibilities.

569
00:49:57,496 --> 00:50:01,000
I've never met a girl
who knew that much about a cryptex.

570
00:50:02,334 --> 00:50:04,587
Saunière made one for me once.

571
00:50:12,553 --> 00:50:15,764
My grandfather gave me a wagon.

572
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:20,603
This clearly is not the Holy Grail.

573
00:50:24,481 --> 00:50:25,649
Come on.

574
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:27,401
Please, you're not all right.

575
00:50:30,779 --> 00:50:32,239
May I try something?

576
00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:34,491
I don't know why it works.

577
00:50:35,409 --> 00:50:38,454
My mother used to do it
when I was scared, I think.

578
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,623
You think?

579
00:50:41,415 --> 00:50:42,499
Yes.

580
00:50:54,386 --> 00:50:56,263
Feeling better, Sophie?

581
00:51:08,192 --> 00:51:12,655
My parents died in a car crash
with my brother.

582
00:51:13,822 --> 00:51:15,157
I was four.

583
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:18,535
I'm sorry.

584
00:51:19,912 --> 00:51:21,830
It was many years ago.

585
00:51:37,513 --> 00:51:38,764
Better?

586
00:51:41,517 --> 00:51:42,518
Yeah.

587
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:44,436
Okay.

588
00:52:10,546 --> 00:52:13,132
Twenty years waiting
for someone to come for that box,

589
00:52:13,215 --> 00:52:15,759
and now it's you two murderers.
Bring it to me.

590
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:18,387
I don't know what you're talking about.

591
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:21,390
All right! Okay!

592
00:52:22,224 --> 00:52:23,225
Right now!

593
00:52:33,694 --> 00:52:34,695
Step back!

594
00:52:38,657 --> 00:52:41,076
No one will lose sleep
over a couple on a killing spree.

595
00:52:44,246 --> 00:52:45,289
Turn around.

596
00:52:46,582 --> 00:52:48,000
Turn around!

597
00:52:48,584 --> 00:52:50,252
You too, mademoiselle.

598
00:53:13,025 --> 00:53:14,193
Sophie!

599
00:53:14,985 --> 00:53:16,362
Get in the truck!

600
00:53:16,862 --> 00:53:18,447
I'll drive! Hurry!

601
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:51,814
What happened between you
and your grandfather, exactly?

602
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,194
I've jammed my shoulder,
I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.

603
00:53:57,319 --> 00:53:58,904
I need to know.

604
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:02,908
You say he raised you,
but you two don't talk anymore.

605
00:54:02,991 --> 00:54:04,785
You call him by his last name.

606
00:54:05,369 --> 00:54:07,579
You say you hate history.

607
00:54:07,663 --> 00:54:10,082
Nobody hates history.
They hate their own histories.

608
00:54:10,165 --> 00:54:12,167
So now you're a psychologist too?

609
00:54:12,626 --> 00:54:17,214
What if Saunière had started
to groom you for the Priory?

610
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:18,757
What do you mean, groom me?

611
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:22,094
Your grandfather gave you puzzles
and cryptex as a child.

612
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:26,181
So you are saying all this is real?
The Priory, the Holy Grail?

613
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:29,643
We've been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real.

614
00:54:29,726 --> 00:54:31,854
- Real enough to kill for.
- Who?

615
00:54:38,068 --> 00:54:40,612
I'm out of my field here.

616
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:48,328
I do know a Grail historian,
absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.

617
00:54:48,996 --> 00:54:51,290
An Englishman, lives here in France.

618
00:54:51,373 --> 00:54:53,000
Do you trust this man?

619
00:54:54,126 --> 00:54:55,669
I hope you can.

620
00:55:05,262 --> 00:55:08,098
It seems you're not a driver at all.

621
00:55:09,933 --> 00:55:14,730
Apparently, you lost your tongue
along with your truck.

622
00:55:15,397 --> 00:55:18,066
You think you're in pain now, André Vernet?

623
00:55:18,484 --> 00:55:22,488
My cause is worth your life. Understand?

624
00:55:26,825 --> 00:55:28,410
What do you want?

625
00:55:28,744 --> 00:55:33,999
Your truck carries a homing device.
Activate it.

626
00:55:41,632 --> 00:55:44,343
Please wait. I'll see if he's available.

627
00:55:44,468 --> 00:55:46,345
It's on the wrong side.

628
00:55:46,428 --> 00:55:49,056
Leigh likes all things to be English,
including his cars.

629
00:55:49,139 --> 00:55:52,267
Robert! Do I owe you money?

630
00:55:53,018 --> 00:55:56,021
Leigh, my friend,

631
00:55:56,104 --> 00:55:59,191
care to open up for an old colleague?

632
00:55:59,274 --> 00:56:00,984
- Of course.
- Thank you.

633
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:04,238
But first, a test of honor.

634
00:56:04,613 --> 00:56:06,323
Three questions.

635
00:56:09,618 --> 00:56:10,953
Fire away.

636
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:12,454
Your first.

637
00:56:12,663 --> 00:56:15,332
Shall I serve coffee or tea?

638
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:17,709
Tea, of course.

639
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:18,961
Excellent.

640
00:56:19,044 --> 00:56:21,338
Second. Milk or lemon?

641
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:23,423
Milk?

642
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,219
That would depend on the tea.

643
00:56:27,302 --> 00:56:28,387
Correct.

644
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:33,475
And now the third
and most grave of inquiries.

645
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:39,106
In which year did a Harvard sculler
out-row an Oxford man at Henley?

646
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:50,284
Surely such a travesty has never occurred.

647
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:52,786
Your heart is true.

648
00:56:53,662 --> 00:56:54,997
You may pass.

649
00:56:56,832 --> 00:56:59,167
Welcome to Château Villette.

650
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:04,715
The truck's signal is coming online.

651
00:57:04,923 --> 00:57:06,341
It's about time.

652
00:57:10,095 --> 00:57:11,722
Locked on and tracking, sir.

653
00:57:14,558 --> 00:57:17,978
Very good. Tell Collet not to move in
until I get there.

654
00:57:19,563 --> 00:57:23,025
Attention! All of Collet's units
to Château Villette.

655
00:57:23,942 --> 00:57:27,279
The suspects Neveu and Langdon
are likely at that location.

656
00:57:43,587 --> 00:57:44,921
Aringarosa.

657
00:57:55,891 --> 00:57:58,894
I still don't know why he put you into this

658
00:57:59,603 --> 00:58:01,521
and I'm sorry.

659
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:10,447
But I'm also very glad.

660
00:58:28,715 --> 00:58:31,385
You are requested to make yourself at home.

661
00:58:39,685 --> 00:58:40,852
Robert!

662
00:58:41,937 --> 00:58:44,523
And you travel with a maiden, it seems.

663
00:58:44,856 --> 00:58:48,068
Sir Leigh Teabing,
may I present Miss Sophie Neveu.

664
00:58:48,151 --> 00:58:50,278
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.

665
00:58:50,654 --> 00:58:54,491
It's an honor to welcome you...

666
00:58:55,117 --> 00:58:57,202
...even though it's late.

667
00:58:57,285 --> 00:59:01,123
Thank you for having us.
I realize it's quite late.

668
00:59:02,416 --> 00:59:05,419
So late, mademoiselle, it's almost early.

669
00:59:08,046 --> 00:59:09,673
What a lovely smile you have.

670
00:59:12,008 --> 00:59:13,009
Earl Grey?

671
00:59:13,719 --> 00:59:14,803
Lemon.

672
00:59:15,512 --> 00:59:16,638
Correct.

673
00:59:37,534 --> 00:59:39,786
Château Villette. Yes.

674
00:59:41,496 --> 00:59:43,582
A dramatic late-night arrival.

675
00:59:43,915 --> 00:59:46,543
What can an old cripple do for you, Robert?

676
00:59:47,461 --> 00:59:51,339
We wanna talk about the Priory of Sion.

677
00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:52,716
The keepers?

678
00:59:53,633 --> 00:59:54,885
The secret war?

679
00:59:54,968 --> 00:59:56,970
Sorry for all the mystery.

680
00:59:57,888 --> 01:00:00,974
Leigh, I'm into something here
that I cannot understand.

681
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:02,517
You?

682
01:00:03,226 --> 01:00:06,605
- Really?
- Not without your help.

683
01:00:07,022 --> 01:00:10,233
Playing to my vanity, Robert.
You should be ashamed.

684
01:00:10,317 --> 01:00:11,526
Not if it works.

685
01:00:14,112 --> 01:00:16,281
There are always four.

686
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:20,202
The Grand Master and the three sénéchaux

687
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:23,830
make up the primary guardians of the Grail.

688
01:00:25,749 --> 01:00:27,709
Thank you, Remy. That'll be all for now.

689
01:00:34,299 --> 01:00:37,761
The Priory's members
span our very globe itself.

690
01:00:37,844 --> 01:00:42,390
Philippe de Chérisey
exposed that as a hoax in 1967.

691
01:00:42,474 --> 01:00:44,601
And that is what they want you to believe.

692
01:00:45,352 --> 01:00:48,230
The Priory is charged with a single task.

693
01:00:48,355 --> 01:00:51,817
To protect the greatest secret
in modern history.

694
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,444
The source of God's power on Earth.

695
01:00:54,528 --> 01:00:56,279
No, that's a common misunderstanding.

696
01:00:56,404 --> 01:01:01,034
The Priory protects the source
of the Church's power on Earth.

697
01:01:02,035 --> 01:01:03,328
The Holy Grail.

698
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:05,622
I don't understand.

699
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:09,835
What power? Some magic dishes?

700
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:14,673
Robert. Has he been telling you
that the Holy Grail is a cup?

701
01:01:29,229 --> 01:01:33,066
The Good Book did not arrive
by facsimile from heaven.

702
01:01:33,775 --> 01:01:38,405
The Bible as we know it
was finally presided over by one man.

703
01:01:38,488 --> 01:01:40,240
The pagan emperor Constantine.

704
01:01:40,657 --> 01:01:42,784
I thought Constantine was a Christian.

705
01:01:42,993 --> 01:01:46,037
Hardly, no. He was a lifelong pagan

706
01:01:46,121 --> 01:01:48,748
who was baptized on his deathbed.

707
01:01:48,832 --> 01:01:51,626
Constantine was Rome's supreme holy man.

708
01:01:52,627 --> 01:01:54,254
From time immemorial,

709
01:01:54,337 --> 01:01:58,925
his people had worshiped a balance
between nature's male deities

710
01:01:59,009 --> 01:02:02,512
and the goddess or sacred feminine.

711
01:02:03,305 --> 01:02:06,850
But a growing religious turmoil
was gripping Rome.

712
01:02:07,517 --> 01:02:09,519
Three centuries earlier,

713
01:02:09,603 --> 01:02:12,397
a young Jew named Jesus had come along,

714
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,983
preaching love and a single God.

715
01:02:15,275 --> 01:02:18,069
Centuries after his crucifixion,

716
01:02:18,862 --> 01:02:21,197
Christ's followers had grown exponentially

717
01:02:21,281 --> 01:02:24,367
and had started a religious war
against the pagans.

718
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:32,876
Or did the pagans commence war
against the Christians?

719
01:02:33,543 --> 01:02:36,755
Leigh, we can't be sure who began
the atrocities in that period.

720
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:40,050
But we can at least agree
that the conflict grew to such proportions

721
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:41,801
that it threatened to tear Rome in two.

722
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:46,264
So Constantine may have been
a lifelong pagan,

723
01:02:46,348 --> 01:02:48,058
but he was also a pragmatist.

724
01:02:48,141 --> 01:02:50,644
And in 325 Anno Domini,

725
01:02:50,727 --> 01:02:55,941
he decided to unify Rome
under a single religion, Christianity.

726
01:02:56,024 --> 01:02:59,861
Christianity was on the rise.
He didn't want his empire torn apart.

727
01:03:00,403 --> 01:03:03,490
And to strengthen
this new Christian tradition,

728
01:03:03,573 --> 01:03:06,242
Constantine held
a famous ecumenical gathering

729
01:03:06,326 --> 01:03:08,870
known as the Council of Nicaea.

730
01:03:09,371 --> 01:03:10,956
And at this council,

731
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:15,794
the many sects of Christianity
debated and voted on, well,

732
01:03:15,877 --> 01:03:20,131
everything, from the acceptance
and rejection of specific gospels

733
01:03:20,215 --> 01:03:21,758
to the date for Easter

734
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:24,803
to the administering of the sacraments,
and of course,

735
01:03:24,886 --> 01:03:27,055
the immortality of Jesus.

736
01:03:27,764 --> 01:03:29,015
I don't follow.

737
01:03:29,432 --> 01:03:32,310
Well, ma chère, until
that moment in history,

738
01:03:32,394 --> 01:03:37,232
Jesus was viewed by many
of his followers as a mighty prophet,

739
01:03:37,315 --> 01:03:41,152
as a great and powerful man,
but a man nevertheless.

740
01:03:41,569 --> 01:03:43,405
A mortal man.

741
01:03:43,613 --> 01:03:44,906
Not the Son of God?

742
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:47,617
Not even his nephew twice removed.

743
01:03:47,701 --> 01:03:51,538
Constantine did not create Jesus' divinity.

744
01:03:51,621 --> 01:03:55,583
He simply sanctioned
an already widely held idea.

745
01:03:55,667 --> 01:03:57,502
- Semantics.
- No, it's not semantics.

746
01:03:57,585 --> 01:04:00,755
You're interpreting facts
to support your own conclusions.

747
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:05,593
Fact. For many Christians, Jesus was
mortal one day and divine the next.

748
01:04:05,677 --> 01:04:07,679
For some Christians,
his divinity was enhanced.

749
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:10,306
Absurd. There was even a formal
announcement of his promotion.

750
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:12,350
They couldn't even agree
on the Nicene Creed!

751
01:04:12,434 --> 01:04:15,854
Excuse me. "Who is God, who is man?"

752
01:04:20,567 --> 01:04:23,445
How many have been murdered
over this question?

753
01:04:24,279 --> 01:04:27,323
As long as there has been a one true God,

754
01:04:27,407 --> 01:04:29,576
there has been killing in his name.

755
01:04:38,126 --> 01:04:40,754
Now let me show you the Grail.

756
01:04:43,298 --> 01:04:46,468
I trust you recognize The Last Supper,

757
01:04:46,551 --> 01:04:50,555
the great fresco by Leonardo da Vinci.

758
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:55,685
Now, my dear, if you would close your eyes.

759
01:04:55,769 --> 01:04:57,604
Leigh, save us the parlor tricks.

760
01:04:58,188 --> 01:05:00,523
You asked for my help, I recall.

761
01:05:00,607 --> 01:05:03,234
Allow an old man his indulgences.

762
01:05:07,655 --> 01:05:11,076
Now, mademoiselle, where is Jesus sitting?

763
01:05:11,659 --> 01:05:13,495
- In the middle.
- Good.

764
01:05:13,578 --> 01:05:16,414
He and his disciples are breaking bread.

765
01:05:16,623 --> 01:05:19,292
And what drink?

766
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:21,377
Wine. They drank wine.

767
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:23,880
Splendid. And one final question.

768
01:05:23,963 --> 01:05:26,633
How many wineglasses are
there on the table?

769
01:05:28,343 --> 01:05:30,386
One? The Holy Grail?

770
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:31,471
Open your eyes.

771
01:05:34,432 --> 01:05:36,059
No single cup.

772
01:05:36,643 --> 01:05:37,852
No chalice.

773
01:05:38,061 --> 01:05:40,814
Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?

774
01:05:41,022 --> 01:05:43,983
Considering both the Bible
and standard Grail legend

775
01:05:44,067 --> 01:05:48,363
celebrate this moment as the
definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.

776
01:05:51,366 --> 01:05:54,035
Now, Robert, you could be of help to us.

777
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:58,039
If you'd be so kind as to show us
the symbols for man and woman, please.

778
01:05:58,206 --> 01:06:01,918
No balloon animals. I
can make a great duck.

779
01:06:04,963 --> 01:06:09,217
This is the original icon for male.
It's a rudimentary phallus.

780
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,553
- Quite to the point.
- Yes, indeed.

781
01:06:11,636 --> 01:06:13,721
This is known as the blade.

782
01:06:13,888 --> 01:06:15,890
It represents aggression and manhood.

783
01:06:15,974 --> 01:06:18,726
It's a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms.

784
01:06:18,852 --> 01:06:23,106
Yes, the more penises you have,
the higher your rank. Boys will be boys.

785
01:06:23,189 --> 01:06:27,610
Now, as you would imagine,
the female symbol is its exact opposite.

786
01:06:27,694 --> 01:06:28,987
This is called the chalice.

787
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:34,242
And the chalice resembles
a cup or vessel or, more importantly,

788
01:06:34,325 --> 01:06:36,494
the shape of a woman's womb.

789
01:06:37,704 --> 01:06:40,790
No, the Grail has never been a cup.

790
01:06:40,874 --> 01:06:45,837
It is quite literally
this ancient symbol of womanhood.

791
01:06:46,963 --> 01:06:52,218
And in this case, a woman who
carried a secret so powerful

792
01:06:52,302 --> 01:06:56,598
that if revealed, it would devastate
the very foundations of Christianity.

793
01:06:56,806 --> 01:06:58,141
Wait, please.

794
01:06:58,224 --> 01:07:02,770
You're saying the Holy Grail is a person?
A woman?

795
01:07:03,646 --> 01:07:07,609
And it turns out,
she makes an appearance right there.

796
01:07:08,109 --> 01:07:09,777
But they are all men.

797
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:11,321
Are they?

798
01:07:11,404 --> 01:07:13,907
What about that figure
on the right hand of our Lord,

799
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:16,701
seated in the place of honor?

800
01:07:17,535 --> 01:07:19,370
Flowing red hair.

801
01:07:20,496 --> 01:07:22,790
Folded feminine hands.

802
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:26,377
Hint of a bosom. No?

803
01:07:31,883 --> 01:07:35,261
It's called scotoma.
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

804
01:07:35,595 --> 01:07:36,971
Who is she?

805
01:07:38,264 --> 01:07:40,141
My dear, that's Mary Magdalene.

806
01:07:40,516 --> 01:07:41,559
The prostitute?

807
01:07:42,518 --> 01:07:43,978
She was no such thing.

808
01:07:44,395 --> 01:07:48,983
Smeared by the Church in 591 Anno Domini,
poor dear.

809
01:07:51,444 --> 01:07:54,239
Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.

810
01:08:01,287 --> 01:08:03,373
This is an old wives' tale.

811
01:08:03,456 --> 01:08:05,041
The original one, in fact.

812
01:08:05,124 --> 01:08:07,210
There's virtually no empirical proof.

813
01:08:07,377 --> 01:08:10,713
He knows as well as I do
there's much evidence to support it.

814
01:08:10,797 --> 01:08:12,423
Theories. There are theories.

815
01:08:12,507 --> 01:08:15,677
Notice how Jesus and Mary are clothed.

816
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,389
Mirror images of each other.

817
01:08:19,472 --> 01:08:22,058
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

818
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:24,727
And venturing into the even more bizarre,

819
01:08:24,811 --> 01:08:28,690
notice how Jesus and Mary
appear to be joined at the hip

820
01:08:28,773 --> 01:08:30,400
and are leaning away from each other

821
01:08:30,483 --> 01:08:35,029
as if to create a shape
in the negative space between them.

822
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:39,367
Leonardo gives us the chalice.

823
01:08:41,911 --> 01:08:44,455
Yes. And Robert, notice what happens

824
01:08:44,539 --> 01:08:47,959
when these two figures change position.

825
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:51,212
Just because da Vinci painted it
doesn't make it true.

826
01:08:52,213 --> 01:08:54,090
No. But history,

827
01:08:54,507 --> 01:08:56,301
she does make it true.

828
01:08:56,509 --> 01:08:59,721
Now, listen to this.
It's from the Gospel according to Philip.

829
01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:00,930
Philip?

830
01:09:01,014 --> 01:09:04,100
Yes, it was rejected at
the Council of Nicaea

831
01:09:04,183 --> 01:09:08,980
along with any other gospels that made
Jesus appear human and not divine.

832
01:09:09,063 --> 01:09:13,985
"And the companion of the Savior
is Mary Magdalene.

833
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:18,197
"Christ loved her more
than all the disciples

834
01:09:18,281 --> 01:09:19,991
"and used to kiss her on the..."

835
01:09:20,074 --> 01:09:22,327
But this says nothing of marriage.

836
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:26,331
Well, actually... Robert.

837
01:09:26,956 --> 01:09:31,586
Actually, in those days, the word
"companion" literally meant "spouse."

838
01:09:31,794 --> 01:09:36,257
And this is from the Gospel
of Mary Magdalene herself.

839
01:09:36,424 --> 01:09:39,093
- She wrote a gospel?
- She may have.

840
01:09:39,302 --> 01:09:42,263
- Robert, will you fight fair?
- She may have.

841
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:46,434
"And Peter said, 'Did he prefer her to us?'

842
01:09:47,393 --> 01:09:48,770
"And Levi answered,

843
01:09:48,853 --> 01:09:52,940
"'Peter, I see you contending
against a woman like an adversary.

844
01:09:53,149 --> 01:09:57,612
"If the Savior made her worthy,
who are you, indeed, to reject her?"'

845
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:02,408
Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus
goes on to tell Mary Magdalene

846
01:10:02,492 --> 01:10:06,329
that it's up to her to continue his Church.

847
01:10:07,455 --> 01:10:10,124
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.

848
01:10:10,458 --> 01:10:14,295
The Church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman.

849
01:10:15,213 --> 01:10:19,926
Few realize that Mary was descended
from kings, just as her husband was.

850
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:25,723
Now, my dear,
the word in French for Holy Grail.

851
01:10:27,183 --> 01:10:30,436
From the Middle English "Sangreal,"

852
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,231
of the original Arthurian legend.

853
01:10:33,314 --> 01:10:38,444
Now, as two words.
Can you translate for our friend?

854
01:10:41,114 --> 01:10:43,241
It means "royal blood."

855
01:10:44,325 --> 01:10:48,538
When the legend speaks of
the chalice that held the blood of Christ,

856
01:10:48,955 --> 01:10:54,252
it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.

857
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:58,172
But how could Christ
have a bloodline unless...

858
01:10:58,256 --> 01:11:01,092
Mary was pregnant
at the time of the Crucifixion.

859
01:11:09,851 --> 01:11:14,313
For her own safety
and for that of Christ's unborn child,

860
01:11:14,397 --> 01:11:17,442
she fled the Holy Land and came to France.

861
01:11:17,525 --> 01:11:22,613
And here, it is said,
she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.

862
01:11:23,948 --> 01:11:26,325
They know the child's name.

863
01:11:27,285 --> 01:11:29,162
- A little girl.
- Yes.

864
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,581
If that were true,
it's adding insult to injury.

865
01:11:31,664 --> 01:11:32,707
Why?

866
01:11:32,915 --> 01:11:36,544
The pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female.

867
01:11:36,752 --> 01:11:38,463
People found God through sex?

868
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:41,632
In paganism, women were worshiped
as a route to heaven,

869
01:11:41,716 --> 01:11:44,552
but the modern Church
has a monopoly on that

870
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:46,679
in salvation through Jesus Christ.

871
01:11:46,762 --> 01:11:50,016
And he who keeps the keys to heaven
rules the world.

872
01:11:50,099 --> 01:11:52,435
Women, then, are a huge
threat to the Church.

873
01:11:53,478 --> 01:11:55,438
The Catholic Inquisition soon publishes

874
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:58,816
what may be the most blood-soaked book
in human history.

875
01:11:59,025 --> 01:12:01,402
The Malleus Maleficarum.

876
01:12:02,528 --> 01:12:04,405
The Witches' Hammer.

877
01:12:04,489 --> 01:12:08,326
It instructed the clergy on how
to locate, torture and kill

878
01:12:08,409 --> 01:12:09,827
all freethinking women.

879
01:12:13,831 --> 01:12:16,042
In three centuries of witch hunts,

880
01:12:16,459 --> 01:12:20,296
50, 000 women are captured,
burned alive at the stake.

881
01:12:20,379 --> 01:12:23,007
At least that. Some say millions.

882
01:12:23,591 --> 01:12:25,301
Imagine, then, Robert,

883
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:29,680
that Christ's throne
might live on in a female child.

884
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:33,684
You asked what would be worth killing for.

885
01:12:34,268 --> 01:12:37,855
Witness the greatest cover-up
in human history.

886
01:12:38,648 --> 01:12:41,025
This is the secret that the Priory of Sion

887
01:12:41,108 --> 01:12:43,486
has defended for over 20 centuries.

888
01:12:43,569 --> 01:12:46,739
They are the guardians
of the royal bloodline.

889
01:12:47,406 --> 01:12:50,993
The keepers of the proof of our true past.

890
01:12:51,077 --> 01:12:55,081
They are the protectors of the living
descendants of Jesus Christ

891
01:12:57,208 --> 01:12:58,960
and Mary Magdalene.

892
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:09,971
Sir Leigh?

893
01:13:10,763 --> 01:13:14,058
Sometimes I wonder who is serving whom.

894
01:13:14,767 --> 01:13:17,812
His sauces are not that fantastic.

895
01:13:20,189 --> 01:13:21,774
Yes, can I help you?

896
01:13:21,857 --> 01:13:23,901
Yes. They're on the news now.

897
01:13:26,946 --> 01:13:30,366
Living descendants? Is it possible?

898
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:32,076
It's not impossible.

899
01:13:33,327 --> 01:13:36,998
You have not been honest with me.
Your pictures are on the television.

900
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:39,000
You are wanted for four murders!

901
01:13:39,417 --> 01:13:41,586
That's why Vernet said, "Killing spree."

902
01:13:41,669 --> 01:13:45,423
You come into my home,
playing on my passions for the Grail.

903
01:13:45,506 --> 01:13:48,092
- That's why he needed you, Sophie.
- You will leave my house!

904
01:13:48,175 --> 01:13:50,177
- Leigh, listen!
- No, I'm calling the police.

905
01:13:50,261 --> 01:13:52,263
Jacques Saunière was her grandfather.

906
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,351
You're the obsessive Priory scholar, Leigh.

907
01:13:57,435 --> 01:13:59,687
You still keep lists
of who might be in the Priory?

908
01:14:00,855 --> 01:14:03,691
I'll bet Jacques Saunière
was on one of those lists.

909
01:14:05,651 --> 01:14:08,154
He was on your list of who could
be Grand Master, wasn't he?

910
01:14:08,487 --> 01:14:11,032
- What?
- I'll bet he was right at the top.

911
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:16,537
Consider. Four men murdered?
The same number as the guardians.

912
01:14:16,621 --> 01:14:19,874
What if the Priory was compromised,
the other sénéchaux dead?

913
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:22,209
What if you yourself were dying,
a Grand Master?

914
01:14:22,835 --> 01:14:26,297
You'd have to pass the secret on
to someone you could trust.

915
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:28,215
Someone outside the society.

916
01:14:28,382 --> 01:14:33,054
Maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished.

917
01:14:35,973 --> 01:14:38,476
Robert, your ruse is pathetic.

918
01:14:39,602 --> 01:14:40,978
Not really.

919
01:14:42,563 --> 01:14:44,774
No, that's impossible.

920
01:14:47,902 --> 01:14:49,570
Can that really...

921
01:14:51,947 --> 01:14:53,240
Is it the keystone?

922
01:14:56,619 --> 01:14:59,246
I'll even show it to you, Leigh.

923
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:01,499
Will you just tell us
what the hell it's for?

924
01:15:19,433 --> 01:15:21,102
Fache says to wait, so I wait.

925
01:15:21,352 --> 01:15:25,439
What's Fache thinking?
The truck is here. They're inside.

926
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,366
Yes.

927
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:38,369
As the legend foretold,

928
01:15:40,162 --> 01:15:42,456
"It hides beneath the Rose."

929
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:44,125
Oh, my.

930
01:15:51,048 --> 01:15:52,508
Leigh.

931
01:15:55,928 --> 01:15:57,388
Leigh?

932
01:15:58,264 --> 01:15:59,306
Please.

933
01:15:59,515 --> 01:16:01,517
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

934
01:16:03,936 --> 01:16:05,980
Inside the keystone,

935
01:16:07,314 --> 01:16:08,941
there'll be a map.

936
01:16:09,024 --> 01:16:11,819
A map that will lead us to the Holy Grail.

937
01:16:15,781 --> 01:16:18,701
To be trained by the Grand Master himself.

938
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:22,997
Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?
Is that how you found this?

939
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:28,544
And he must have sung you the riddle songs.

940
01:16:28,627 --> 01:16:30,171
I know some of them.

941
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:41,265
Can you keep secrets?

942
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:45,728
Can you know a thing and
never say it again?

943
01:16:46,812 --> 01:16:47,855
And codes?

944
01:16:49,148 --> 01:16:53,152
I imagine they lie down
for you like lovers.

945
01:16:56,155 --> 01:17:01,160
A sénéchal. A guardian of the Grail
right here in my own home.

946
01:17:01,243 --> 01:17:04,205
Tell him, please. I don't know any of this.

947
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:07,208
Leigh, it's not that simple. She doesn't...

948
01:17:08,751 --> 01:17:10,002
Robert!

949
01:17:15,341 --> 01:17:16,717
Do not move, woman.

950
01:17:20,971 --> 01:17:21,972
Cripple.

951
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:25,893
Put the box on the table.

952
01:17:27,061 --> 01:17:28,437
What, this trifle?

953
01:17:29,021 --> 01:17:32,650
Well, perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement.

954
01:17:33,192 --> 01:17:36,237
Put the keystone on the table.

955
01:17:37,196 --> 01:17:38,823
You will not succeed.

956
01:17:41,116 --> 01:17:44,286
Only the worthy can unlock the stone.

957
01:18:13,649 --> 01:18:16,068
Rip the gate down.

958
01:18:19,572 --> 01:18:21,282
Well, well, my dear.

959
01:18:25,452 --> 01:18:26,787
Sit down.

960
01:18:26,954 --> 01:18:28,372
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

961
01:18:28,581 --> 01:18:30,708
- Are you?
- Yeah.

962
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:33,210
Yes, well, make yourself useful,
you French fool.

963
01:18:33,294 --> 01:18:35,462
Get something to restrain this monster.

964
01:18:40,634 --> 01:18:42,219
Above the joint.

965
01:18:43,095 --> 01:18:47,141
Fortunately, a dragon most easy to slay.

966
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:49,268
He's wearing a cilice.

967
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:52,271
- A what?
- Well, look.

968
01:18:54,773 --> 01:18:57,735
Inflicts pain so he can suffer
as Christ suffered.

969
01:18:57,818 --> 01:18:58,944
Opus Dei.

970
01:18:59,028 --> 01:19:00,529
Fache is Opus Dei.

971
01:19:02,031 --> 01:19:05,117
The policeman who's chasing us.
He wears the cross in the world.

972
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,201
Robert.

973
01:19:09,163 --> 01:19:12,458
Well, I must say,
you two are anything but dull.

974
01:19:13,709 --> 01:19:14,710
Leigh?

975
01:19:16,921 --> 01:19:18,339
You want what's in this box?

976
01:19:20,007 --> 01:19:21,842
We need a way out of here.

977
01:19:21,926 --> 01:19:26,138
Well, actually, I do have a plane.

978
01:19:37,274 --> 01:19:39,234
- Robert! Where do we go?
- Come along.

979
01:19:39,318 --> 01:19:41,153
- In here. Come in.
- Over here.

980
01:19:41,362 --> 01:19:43,822
Get the door. Hurry

981
01:19:45,866 --> 01:19:47,910
Over here. Over here. Sophie.

982
01:19:47,993 --> 01:19:49,244
Watch out!

983
01:19:50,621 --> 01:19:52,247
Be careful.

984
01:19:52,331 --> 01:19:53,540
Come, Rem...

985
01:20:01,382 --> 01:20:02,716
Shit.

986
01:20:05,803 --> 01:20:06,845
Easy.

987
01:20:29,868 --> 01:20:30,953
Jesus!

988
01:20:31,036 --> 01:20:32,079
Apropos.

989
01:20:34,873 --> 01:20:36,709
I can't imagine what your complaint is.

990
01:20:36,792 --> 01:20:39,795
I'd be within my rights to shoot you
and let you rot in my woods!

991
01:20:39,962 --> 01:20:42,339
Put that away. We might need him.

992
01:20:43,132 --> 01:20:44,258
Better.

993
01:20:51,265 --> 01:20:52,891
Opus Dei.

994
01:20:53,851 --> 01:20:56,478
- What is it?
- A conservative Catholic sect.

995
01:20:56,562 --> 01:20:58,480
Opus Dei is a prelature to the Vatican.

996
01:20:58,564 --> 01:21:02,067
You're saying the Vatican
is killing people for this box?

997
01:21:02,151 --> 01:21:04,194
No, no, no. Not the Vatican

998
01:21:04,278 --> 01:21:06,905
and not Opus Dei,
but we are in the middle of a war.

999
01:21:06,989 --> 01:21:09,533
And one that has been going on forever.

1000
01:21:09,616 --> 01:21:11,869
On the one side stands the Priory

1001
01:21:11,952 --> 01:21:14,788
and on the other an
ancient group of despots

1002
01:21:14,913 --> 01:21:17,291
with members hidden in
high-ranking positions

1003
01:21:17,374 --> 01:21:19,251
throughout the Church.

1004
01:21:19,334 --> 01:21:23,630
And this Council of Shadows tries
to destroy proof of the bloodline.

1005
01:21:23,714 --> 01:21:26,967
And that throughout history,
they seek out and kill

1006
01:21:27,051 --> 01:21:28,927
the living descendants of Jesus Christ.

1007
01:21:29,011 --> 01:21:30,846
- That's insane.
- Is it?

1008
01:21:32,556 --> 01:21:33,682
What if the world discovers

1009
01:21:33,766 --> 01:21:36,894
that the greatest story ever told
is actually a lie?

1010
01:21:36,977 --> 01:21:40,647
The Vatican faces
a crisis of faith unprecedented.

1011
01:21:41,398 --> 01:21:44,026
I've got a signal now, sir. It's ringing.

1012
01:21:45,819 --> 01:21:50,324
Roger, look, I'm so sorry. I've got
tired of the weather here in France

1013
01:21:50,407 --> 01:21:53,327
and could you make the plane ready for...

1014
01:21:56,205 --> 01:21:57,372
Zürich.

1015
01:21:57,956 --> 01:21:59,416
Yes. No, we love Zürich.

1016
01:22:07,299 --> 01:22:09,843
What the hell do you mean,
you lost them? Collet.

1017
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:13,430
You're the one who lost them.

1018
01:22:13,806 --> 01:22:15,182
You control every step
of this investigation.

1019
01:22:15,349 --> 01:22:17,935
You don't let anybody breathe.

1020
01:22:18,435 --> 01:22:21,146
You're acting like you lost your mind.

1021
01:22:24,525 --> 01:22:27,361
What is it with these two birds?

1022
01:22:31,448 --> 01:22:34,326
Interpol just registered a new
flight plan from Le Bourget.

1023
01:22:35,202 --> 01:22:38,455
Stay out of my way on this, Collet.

1024
01:23:06,066 --> 01:23:07,901
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1025
01:23:11,321 --> 01:23:13,365
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1026
01:23:14,324 --> 01:23:16,118
I am the messenger of God.

1027
01:23:19,997 --> 01:23:22,166
Did you kill my grandfather?

1028
01:23:25,294 --> 01:23:26,753
I am the messenger...

1029
01:23:27,421 --> 01:23:31,466
Each breath you take is a sin.

1030
01:23:32,968 --> 01:23:35,387
No shadow will be safe again.

1031
01:23:35,596 --> 01:23:40,309
For you will be hunted by angels.

1032
01:23:41,768 --> 01:23:43,729
You believe in God?

1033
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:47,482
Your God doesn't forgive murderers.

1034
01:23:51,028 --> 01:23:52,863
He burns them.

1035
01:24:04,082 --> 01:24:05,083
Sophie.

1036
01:24:31,693 --> 01:24:33,403
The Teacher will be pleased.

1037
01:24:33,487 --> 01:24:35,781
What will you do once you have the Grail?

1038
01:24:35,864 --> 01:24:36,907
Destroy it.

1039
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:40,661
The documents and the
sarcophagus, of course.

1040
01:24:42,329 --> 01:24:43,705
And the heir?

1041
01:24:47,501 --> 01:24:51,004
Will you exercise the final edict?
Spill his blood?

1042
01:24:51,588 --> 01:24:53,173
There will be no need.

1043
01:24:53,257 --> 01:24:58,095
Once the sarcophagus is destroyed,
DNA testing will be impossible.

1044
01:24:58,178 --> 01:25:00,889
There is no way to prove
a living bloodline.

1045
01:25:01,598 --> 01:25:03,225
But if you had to,

1046
01:25:04,851 --> 01:25:07,896
would you do as councils
have done before us?

1047
01:25:16,863 --> 01:25:18,198
Christ...

1048
01:25:22,911 --> 01:25:27,207
Christ sacrificed his life
for the betterment of humanity.

1049
01:25:30,836 --> 01:25:33,714
So, too, may be the fate of his seed.

1050
01:25:40,887 --> 01:25:42,681
I need the flight plan.

1051
01:25:42,973 --> 01:25:44,016
Ten minutes.

1052
01:25:44,975 --> 01:25:47,352
I asked you to get it for me.

1053
01:25:48,478 --> 01:25:50,397
I'm on break.

1054
01:25:51,857 --> 01:25:53,442
Come back in 10 minutes.

1055
01:25:55,444 --> 01:25:57,612
My nose! My nose!

1056
01:25:58,196 --> 01:25:59,614
The flight plan, please.

1057
01:25:59,781 --> 01:26:00,782
You asshole!

1058
01:26:14,046 --> 01:26:15,756
It's not "cross."

1059
01:26:17,007 --> 01:26:18,300
"Spear"?

1060
01:26:22,888 --> 01:26:24,431
What happened to her?

1061
01:26:25,223 --> 01:26:26,808
No one knows.

1062
01:26:27,184 --> 01:26:30,520
Mary Magdalene lived out
her days in hiding.

1063
01:26:32,314 --> 01:26:34,733
And the zealots pursued her still,

1064
01:26:35,317 --> 01:26:39,696
even in death,
trying to destroy proof of her existence.

1065
01:26:40,697 --> 01:26:43,033
But she always had her Knights.

1066
01:26:43,116 --> 01:26:45,577
Brave men sworn to defend her.

1067
01:26:45,869 --> 01:26:48,455
You see, to worship before her sarcophagus,

1068
01:26:48,955 --> 01:26:52,334
to kneel before the bones
of Mary Magdalene,

1069
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:55,712
was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power,

1070
01:26:55,796 --> 01:26:56,797
who were oppressed.

1071
01:26:57,172 --> 01:27:01,718
Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains
and the proof of her bloodline

1072
01:27:01,802 --> 01:27:04,471
until most believed her sarcophagus,

1073
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,140
the Holy Grail,

1074
01:27:08,141 --> 01:27:11,103
was finally lost in time.

1075
01:27:22,030 --> 01:27:23,031
What are you doing?

1076
01:27:23,115 --> 01:27:25,784
At the chateau, you said,
"It hides beneath the Rose."

1077
01:27:25,867 --> 01:27:27,327
No, no, no. Do be careful.

1078
01:27:27,661 --> 01:27:32,666
- In Latin, sub rosa. Literal translation.
- "Beneath the rose."

1079
01:27:46,054 --> 01:27:47,514
We need a mirror.

1080
01:27:47,722 --> 01:27:50,559
Backwards. In the style
of Leonardo himself.

1081
01:27:50,767 --> 01:27:51,893
Thank you.

1082
01:27:56,773 --> 01:28:00,735
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred

1083
01:28:00,944 --> 01:28:04,656
"His labor's fruit a Holy wrath incurred

1084
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:07,993
"You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb

1085
01:28:08,368 --> 01:28:12,038
"It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb"

1086
01:28:12,205 --> 01:28:16,168
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred"?

1087
01:28:16,376 --> 01:28:20,172
A knight whose funeral
was presided over by the Pope.

1088
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:23,675
Of course, the Priory knights
were not just any knights.

1089
01:28:23,758 --> 01:28:24,843
Templars.

1090
01:28:24,926 --> 01:28:28,013
And there's just one place to bury
a Templar knight in London.

1091
01:28:28,096 --> 01:28:29,222
Temple Church.

1092
01:28:29,306 --> 01:28:31,475
Temple Church. If you'll
excuse me, my dear,

1093
01:28:31,558 --> 01:28:34,394
Roger and I must discuss
a change in flight plan.

1094
01:28:34,936 --> 01:28:36,313
Leigh.

1095
01:28:38,064 --> 01:28:40,442
Harboring and transporting fugitives?

1096
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:43,778
You are already implicated enough.

1097
01:28:44,988 --> 01:28:48,575
You and I, Robert, have observed history.

1098
01:28:48,783 --> 01:28:50,577
Time has been our glass.

1099
01:28:51,578 --> 01:28:54,789
We are in history now. Living it.

1100
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,126
Making it.

1101
01:28:58,835 --> 01:29:00,420
"Implicated"?

1102
01:29:00,504 --> 01:29:03,048
I am on a Grail quest.

1103
01:29:04,674 --> 01:29:06,301
Forgive me, Robert,

1104
01:29:06,384 --> 01:29:08,803
but you two may well
have given this old man

1105
01:29:08,887 --> 01:29:11,223
the greatest night of his life.

1106
01:29:13,099 --> 01:29:14,226
Thank you.

1107
01:29:16,311 --> 01:29:18,438
He's going to want more money.

1108
01:29:35,622 --> 01:29:39,751
I suppose this is a new technique
for investigations.

1109
01:29:39,918 --> 01:29:45,048
I've lost them. They flew to Switzerland.

1110
01:29:45,298 --> 01:29:47,509
No extradition.

1111
01:29:50,262 --> 01:29:56,560
The controller filed charges.
Ari was on dispatch. He called me.

1112
01:30:00,647 --> 01:30:03,733
What's going on, Bezu?

1113
01:30:06,736 --> 01:30:09,614
You know that I am Opus Dei?

1114
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:11,533
Yes.

1115
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:20,333
A bishop of my order called me.

1116
01:30:20,667 --> 01:30:22,794
He said a killer came to him in confession.

1117
01:30:22,961 --> 01:30:25,714
His name was Robert Langdon.

1118
01:30:26,881 --> 01:30:30,010
He said I couldn't imagine
the evil in this man's heart.

1119
01:30:30,176 --> 01:30:32,929
That he would keep killing.

1120
01:30:33,305 --> 01:30:35,765
He said I had to stop him.

1121
01:30:37,809 --> 01:30:41,646
The bishop broke his vows to tell me this.

1122
01:30:41,813 --> 01:30:45,233
He charged me to stop Robert Langdon.

1123
01:30:48,194 --> 01:30:52,949
Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?

1124
01:30:53,742 --> 01:30:55,535
The bishop?

1125
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:58,955
God himself?

1126
01:31:07,589 --> 01:31:10,717
They've changed their
flight plan to London.

1127
01:31:39,412 --> 01:31:43,124
I have them, tower.
Relay Hawker to land and hold on tarmac.

1128
01:32:40,432 --> 01:32:42,642
- Secure the area!
- Wider!

1129
01:32:42,809 --> 01:32:44,936
- Armed police!
- You two, round the back!

1130
01:32:45,311 --> 01:32:48,481
Armed police! Put your hands in the air!

1131
01:32:48,690 --> 01:32:50,483
- Three men up!
- Ready!

1132
01:32:50,567 --> 01:32:52,861
Put your hands in the air! Do it now!

1133
01:32:53,653 --> 01:32:56,030
I'm afraid that's easier said than done
in my case.

1134
01:32:58,116 --> 01:32:59,409
Good morning.

1135
01:32:59,492 --> 01:33:02,579
Did that old cannabis charge
finally catch up with me?

1136
01:33:02,662 --> 01:33:05,498
Sir, the French police say
you're transporting fugitives,

1137
01:33:05,582 --> 01:33:07,333
and you may have a hostage onboard.

1138
01:33:07,417 --> 01:33:08,877
I'm to take you all into custody.

1139
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,463
Sadly, I have an important
medical appointment

1140
01:33:11,546 --> 01:33:12,756
which I can't afford to miss.

1141
01:33:12,839 --> 01:33:14,048
I'll fetch the car, sir.

1142
01:33:14,132 --> 01:33:16,968
This is serious, sir.
The French police are on their way. Stop!

1143
01:33:17,677 --> 01:33:20,847
Inspector, I can't afford the time
to indulge your games.

1144
01:33:20,930 --> 01:33:22,307
I'm late and I'm leaving.

1145
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:24,434
If it's so important for you to stop us,

1146
01:33:24,517 --> 01:33:26,728
then you're just going to have to shoot us.

1147
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,938
You can start with him.

1148
01:33:34,235 --> 01:33:35,612
Search the plane.

1149
01:33:36,321 --> 01:33:37,530
All right.

1150
01:33:49,751 --> 01:33:51,419
I could run them over.

1151
01:33:56,883 --> 01:33:57,884
Bad tip.

1152
01:33:59,844 --> 01:34:01,221
Let him go.

1153
01:34:05,809 --> 01:34:08,186
The French cannot be trusted.

1154
01:34:16,945 --> 01:34:17,987
Everyone comfy?

1155
01:34:20,448 --> 01:34:21,491
Biscuits?

1156
01:34:21,991 --> 01:34:23,451
They didn't notice anything?

1157
01:34:24,077 --> 01:34:28,248
Well, people rarely notice things right
in front of their eyes, don't you find?

1158
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:45,056
Do you have the bonds, bishop?

1159
01:34:45,265 --> 01:34:46,516
Yes, I do, Teacher.

1160
01:34:46,683 --> 01:34:50,019
I have chosen an Opus Dei
residence for the exchange.

1161
01:34:50,186 --> 01:34:51,646
I am honored.

1162
01:34:51,896 --> 01:34:56,734
By the time you get to London,
I will have the Grail.

1163
01:35:02,115 --> 01:35:06,953
Remember, if we are discovered by
the Vatican, we are excommunicated.

1164
01:35:07,036 --> 01:35:10,039
- So should anything go wrong...
- Yes, I know, I know.

1165
01:35:11,457 --> 01:35:13,126
This council does not exist.

1166
01:35:14,127 --> 01:35:15,837
As it never has.

1167
01:35:18,715 --> 01:35:22,468
Old friend. Heaven protect you.

1168
01:35:29,976 --> 01:35:31,936
Keep an eye out for the police.

1169
01:35:45,074 --> 01:35:47,827
I must say, Robert, I'm quite impressed

1170
01:35:47,911 --> 01:35:51,164
by the way you withstood
my little airplane.

1171
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,459
Did he never tell you?

1172
01:35:54,542 --> 01:35:57,962
When he was a boy,
young Robert fell into a well.

1173
01:35:58,046 --> 01:35:59,797
How old were you?

1174
01:35:59,881 --> 01:36:01,007
Seven.

1175
01:36:03,718 --> 01:36:07,096
Treading water all night long,
screaming his lungs out

1176
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:09,098
to the echoes screaming back.

1177
01:36:09,182 --> 01:36:11,726
When they found him, he
was nearly catatonic.

1178
01:36:11,935 --> 01:36:13,019
Help!

1179
01:36:14,062 --> 01:36:15,521
It was a long time ago.

1180
01:36:15,605 --> 01:36:17,482
Now, now, Robert.

1181
01:36:17,565 --> 01:36:21,861
You, above all people, shouldn't be one
to dismiss the influence of the past.

1182
01:36:27,575 --> 01:36:31,788
Tell me, why has the Priory kept
the Grail location secret all these years?

1183
01:36:31,871 --> 01:36:32,872
I don't know.

1184
01:36:33,414 --> 01:36:36,167
Some say the Priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself,

1185
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:38,044
which is especially odd

1186
01:36:38,211 --> 01:36:41,547
since legend suggests
he may not know his own true identity.

1187
01:36:49,555 --> 01:36:50,556
Hello?

1188
01:36:51,349 --> 01:36:53,977
Why do they make them so scary?

1189
01:36:59,607 --> 01:37:00,733
It's cold.

1190
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:04,237
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred."

1191
01:37:13,538 --> 01:37:16,916
So which tomb has an orb?

1192
01:37:19,252 --> 01:37:22,630
Two wear tunics over their armor

1193
01:37:22,714 --> 01:37:25,842
and two have full-length robes.

1194
01:37:26,926 --> 01:37:28,636
Two are grasping swords.

1195
01:37:29,095 --> 01:37:32,724
And one... Two are praying.

1196
01:37:34,684 --> 01:37:36,769
This one has his arms at his sides.

1197
01:37:36,853 --> 01:37:40,523
And this poor fellow
has almost disappeared entirely.

1198
01:37:40,732 --> 01:37:45,445
I don't see any orb that
ought be on a tomb.

1199
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:49,198
"Ought be on his tomb."
Are we looking for a missing orb?

1200
01:37:49,282 --> 01:37:51,117
Maybe. Over here, see.

1201
01:37:56,164 --> 01:37:57,874
These aren't tombs.

1202
01:37:57,957 --> 01:38:00,418
- What? Yes, of course they are.
- No.

1203
01:38:00,501 --> 01:38:02,628
- They're effigies.
- What?

1204
01:38:02,712 --> 01:38:04,797
Not tombs. There's no bodies here.

1205
01:38:04,964 --> 01:38:06,424
This place is wrong.

1206
01:38:08,468 --> 01:38:11,804
Can we go now? We should go.

1207
01:38:14,974 --> 01:38:16,476
Sophie! No!

1208
01:38:18,436 --> 01:38:19,854
Where is the keystone?

1209
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:22,231
Do not test me!

1210
01:38:22,315 --> 01:38:23,608
- Let her go!
- Don't you hurt her.

1211
01:38:23,691 --> 01:38:25,777
- Give me the keystone! Give it to me!
- Can you stop that?

1212
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:27,612
Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is.

1213
01:38:27,695 --> 01:38:30,948
Just let her go, and you and I can...
We'll come to some agreement.

1214
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:33,659
Remy.

1215
01:38:36,996 --> 01:38:39,540
Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away.

1216
01:38:40,833 --> 01:38:43,169
Put it away. They're too close together.
You don't have a clear shot.

1217
01:38:44,295 --> 01:38:46,672
- Yes, I do.
- Stop that. What do you think you're doing?

1218
01:38:48,925 --> 01:38:53,304
Thank you, Professor.
For a moment, this was getting complicated.

1219
01:38:53,387 --> 01:38:55,473
This is absurd. For God's sake, man!

1220
01:38:58,935 --> 01:39:01,145
That was satisfying.

1221
01:39:01,229 --> 01:39:03,106
I'm glad this bullshit is over.

1222
01:39:06,359 --> 01:39:08,069
Throw Teabing in the trunk.

1223
01:39:08,277 --> 01:39:09,529
What?

1224
01:39:14,951 --> 01:39:16,494
Here. You okay?

1225
01:39:22,375 --> 01:39:23,376
Sorry.

1226
01:40:04,417 --> 01:40:06,210
I don't think he's following.

1227
01:40:14,427 --> 01:40:18,306
They won't kill Leigh
until they find the Grail.

1228
01:40:20,433 --> 01:40:23,644
- So we have to find it before they do.
- I have to get to a library, fast.

1229
01:40:31,611 --> 01:40:35,948
He once whined to me about
the wasted space of so large a trunk.

1230
01:40:36,991 --> 01:40:39,118
Let's see if he complains so now.

1231
01:40:40,203 --> 01:40:42,121
Are you the Teacher?

1232
01:40:45,374 --> 01:40:46,417
I am.

1233
01:40:48,211 --> 01:40:52,715
Superbly done. You've
been of great service.

1234
01:40:56,219 --> 01:40:59,222
The cryptex has yet to be opened.
I can still serve.

1235
01:40:59,305 --> 01:41:01,474
You've done enough.

1236
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:08,231
We cannot let ego deter us from our goal.

1237
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,400
I understand.

1238
01:41:12,401 --> 01:41:13,527
Good.

1239
01:41:16,739 --> 01:41:21,619
Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei,
and you will be rewarded.

1240
01:41:21,702 --> 01:41:23,913
I will dispose of the old man.

1241
01:41:25,081 --> 01:41:26,707
Bless you, Silas.

1242
01:41:28,751 --> 01:41:30,002
Teacher.

1243
01:41:38,177 --> 01:41:39,929
Christ be with you.

1244
01:41:42,682 --> 01:41:47,520
We're at least a half-hour
to Chelsea Library.

1245
01:41:48,104 --> 01:41:50,147
If we're gonna help Leigh, that's too long.

1246
01:42:01,867 --> 01:42:03,369
Where are you going?

1247
01:42:03,452 --> 01:42:05,579
Getting you a library card.

1248
01:42:09,208 --> 01:42:11,335
Excuse me. May I sit next to you?

1249
01:42:11,419 --> 01:42:13,921
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1250
01:42:22,471 --> 01:42:23,764
That's great.

1251
01:42:24,724 --> 01:42:26,892
Didn't say you had a boyfriend.

1252
01:42:29,603 --> 01:42:30,896
Thanks.

1253
01:42:31,564 --> 01:42:33,899
Let's see if we can access
the database on this.

1254
01:42:35,234 --> 01:42:38,571
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred."

1255
01:42:38,654 --> 01:42:40,406
Compounding keywords.

1256
01:42:40,614 --> 01:42:43,492
Knight, Pope, Grail.

1257
01:42:44,118 --> 01:42:48,122
Your precious treasure
was almost lost, and with it, my fortune.

1258
01:42:52,543 --> 01:42:54,795
Can you believe how well I did?

1259
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:58,507
I even convinced the monk.

1260
01:42:59,383 --> 01:43:01,302
I should be in theater.

1261
01:43:08,017 --> 01:43:11,020
A toast to our success, Teacher.

1262
01:43:11,103 --> 01:43:13,522
The end of the journey is near.

1263
01:43:16,067 --> 01:43:19,362
Your identity shall go
with me to the grave.

1264
01:43:24,784 --> 01:43:28,454
There's your problem, mate.
It's your basic linguistic coincidence.

1265
01:43:28,871 --> 01:43:31,123
See, keywords keep coming up
with the writings

1266
01:43:31,207 --> 01:43:34,251
of some bloke named Alexander Pope.

1267
01:43:34,335 --> 01:43:35,586
"A. Pope."

1268
01:43:37,213 --> 01:43:38,964
Your grandfather was a genius.

1269
01:43:43,886 --> 01:43:44,929
Come on.

1270
01:44:19,588 --> 01:44:21,424
Emergency. Which service do you require?

1271
01:44:21,507 --> 01:44:26,595
I know the location of two murderers
wanted by French police.

1272
01:44:30,516 --> 01:44:32,726
We've just had a 999 call.

1273
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:35,271
Triangulation leads back to Docklands.

1274
01:44:35,354 --> 01:44:37,523
Caller was male. Claimed your two murderers

1275
01:44:37,606 --> 01:44:40,192
are hiding at an Opus Dei house.

1276
01:44:49,368 --> 01:44:53,456
The knight we're looking for
is Sir Isaac Newton.

1277
01:44:54,999 --> 01:44:58,711
His life's work produced new sciences
that incurred the wrath of the Church.

1278
01:44:59,211 --> 01:45:01,464
Gravity, for God sakes.

1279
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:06,010
And if you choose to believe,

1280
01:45:06,093 --> 01:45:10,514
he was also a Grand Master
of the Priory as well.

1281
01:45:21,233 --> 01:45:23,694
But if he offended the Catholic Church,

1282
01:45:23,777 --> 01:45:27,656
the Pope would be the last person
to preside over his funeral.

1283
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:30,159
Well, that's where I got it wrong.

1284
01:45:30,242 --> 01:45:33,412
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred."

1285
01:45:33,496 --> 01:45:36,290
Sir Isaac Newton's funeral
was presided over

1286
01:45:36,373 --> 01:45:40,503
by his good friend,
his colleague, Alexander Pope.

1287
01:45:40,586 --> 01:45:43,088
A. Pope. His first initial.

1288
01:45:43,172 --> 01:45:44,673
How did I miss that?

1289
01:45:45,424 --> 01:45:46,467
Here.

1290
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:49,678
Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb.

1291
01:45:50,971 --> 01:45:52,306
An orb.

1292
01:45:52,389 --> 01:45:54,058
Yes. Which one?

1293
01:45:54,892 --> 01:45:57,478
It's not possible to tell
if a particular orb is missing.

1294
01:45:57,561 --> 01:46:01,190
"An orb with Rosy flesh and seeded womb."

1295
01:46:01,273 --> 01:46:03,359
Solar system. The planets.

1296
01:46:03,442 --> 01:46:05,945
Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.

1297
01:46:06,529 --> 01:46:08,697
See, our moon is missing.

1298
01:46:08,781 --> 01:46:11,158
The moons of Saturn and Jupiter.
They're not here.

1299
01:46:12,076 --> 01:46:14,245
Eyes of the cherubs themselves?

1300
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:19,124
Robert. These tracks.

1301
01:46:20,251 --> 01:46:22,545
Look at the cane marks in the dust.

1302
01:46:25,756 --> 01:46:27,132
Teabing was here.

1303
01:46:28,551 --> 01:46:29,802
He was alone.

1304
01:46:31,637 --> 01:46:35,724
When the two of you
arrived at my home as you did,

1305
01:46:36,934 --> 01:46:39,436
others might call it God's will.

1306
01:46:40,688 --> 01:46:43,190
I believed that if I had the cryptex

1307
01:46:43,315 --> 01:46:45,734
I could solve the riddle alone.

1308
01:46:47,486 --> 01:46:49,154
But I was unworthy.

1309
01:46:49,238 --> 01:46:50,281
But you...

1310
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:53,784
You have a reason to be here.

1311
01:46:53,867 --> 01:46:57,079
You're the last remaining guardian
of the Grail.

1312
01:46:57,830 --> 01:47:00,040
Your grandfather and the other sénéchaux

1313
01:47:00,124 --> 01:47:02,042
would not have lied with dying breath

1314
01:47:02,126 --> 01:47:04,962
unless they knew their
secret was preserved.

1315
01:47:07,590 --> 01:47:10,259
How could you know Saunière's last words?

1316
01:47:10,342 --> 01:47:11,385
Leigh.

1317
01:47:12,511 --> 01:47:14,763
Grail quests require sacrifice.

1318
01:47:15,389 --> 01:47:16,807
You are a murderer.

1319
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:20,144
No. No. Robert, tell her.

1320
01:47:20,227 --> 01:47:24,023
When history is written,
murderers are heroes.

1321
01:47:26,191 --> 01:47:28,193
You self-righteous bastard!

1322
01:47:28,277 --> 01:47:29,695
We... We need to just walk away.

1323
01:47:29,778 --> 01:47:31,572
- No, don't. Don't.
- Walk away.

1324
01:47:35,034 --> 01:47:36,535
I'll do what I have to now.

1325
01:47:41,874 --> 01:47:43,042
Anything.

1326
01:47:47,212 --> 01:47:48,631
Do you understand?

1327
01:47:50,341 --> 01:47:51,717
So now,

1328
01:47:53,218 --> 01:47:55,220
can't we all be friends again?

1329
01:47:56,555 --> 01:47:57,848
This way.

1330
01:48:34,093 --> 01:48:37,930
I'm going to put this gun down.
I only want you both to listen.

1331
01:48:39,765 --> 01:48:40,933
I'm listening now.

1332
01:48:41,433 --> 01:48:42,935
For 2000 years

1333
01:48:43,602 --> 01:48:47,481
the Church has rained oppression
and atrocity upon mankind,

1334
01:48:48,148 --> 01:48:53,112
crushed passion and idea alike,
all in the name of their walking God.

1335
01:48:53,529 --> 01:48:57,908
Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring
an end to all that suffering,

1336
01:48:58,450 --> 01:49:00,619
drive this church of lies to its knees.

1337
01:49:02,871 --> 01:49:03,956
Armed police!

1338
01:49:04,832 --> 01:49:06,125
Drop your weapon!

1339
01:49:09,670 --> 01:49:10,671
Stop, Silas!

1340
01:49:23,475 --> 01:49:26,311
We are betrayed, my son.

1341
01:49:27,312 --> 01:49:29,440
The living heir must be revealed.

1342
01:49:30,399 --> 01:49:32,693
Jesus must be shown for what he was.

1343
01:49:32,776 --> 01:49:35,654
Not miraculous, simply man.

1344
01:49:37,156 --> 01:49:38,323
I'm sorry.

1345
01:49:40,784 --> 01:49:41,869
Armed police!

1346
01:49:42,327 --> 01:49:45,456
Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!

1347
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:57,676
Put it down now! Put it down!

1348
01:50:05,434 --> 01:50:07,519
I am a ghost.

1349
01:50:08,604 --> 01:50:11,356
The dark con can be exposed.

1350
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:16,403
Mankind can finally be set free,
and we can do it, Robert.

1351
01:50:18,030 --> 01:50:19,323
The three of us.

1352
01:50:37,466 --> 01:50:38,717
How is Silas?

1353
01:50:39,051 --> 01:50:41,386
Is he... Is he alive?

1354
01:50:41,887 --> 01:50:42,930
The monk?

1355
01:50:46,475 --> 01:50:49,394
Bishop, how would you know
this killer's name?

1356
01:50:50,771 --> 01:50:52,481
Get me out of here, Fache.

1357
01:50:53,106 --> 01:50:54,233
Wait.

1358
01:50:57,653 --> 01:51:00,739
Langdon never came to you
in confession, did he?

1359
01:51:01,406 --> 01:51:05,285
One of your followers called you
about the crime-scene photos.

1360
01:51:06,578 --> 01:51:08,247
I cannot be implicated here.

1361
01:51:09,498 --> 01:51:11,625
There are still important works to be done.

1362
01:51:13,252 --> 01:51:14,586
You used me.

1363
01:51:16,505 --> 01:51:18,549
God uses us all.

1364
01:51:19,341 --> 01:51:20,884
Help me, Fache.

1365
01:51:22,052 --> 01:51:23,178
Take him.

1366
01:51:27,933 --> 01:51:29,768
- Did you get his cell phone?
- Yes, sir.

1367
01:51:29,852 --> 01:51:31,895
I'm going to need a trace.

1368
01:51:34,773 --> 01:51:36,608
Your Silas is dead.

1369
01:51:43,699 --> 01:51:45,617
The Priory's sacred charge

1370
01:51:45,701 --> 01:51:48,745
was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium.

1371
01:51:49,663 --> 01:51:54,585
The millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden.

1372
01:51:55,002 --> 01:51:58,463
The Priory failed in their sacred charge.

1373
01:51:59,715 --> 01:52:01,758
So, what choice did I have?

1374
01:52:06,013 --> 01:52:07,806
I sought out the enemy.

1375
01:52:09,308 --> 01:52:13,270
I persuaded them, the Council of Shadows,
that I was an ally.

1376
01:52:14,271 --> 01:52:17,566
I even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me.

1377
01:52:18,442 --> 01:52:20,986
Rector, I made them call me.

1378
01:52:21,945 --> 01:52:23,071
"Teacher."

1379
01:52:23,155 --> 01:52:24,489
- Why don't you and I...
- No.

1380
01:52:24,573 --> 01:52:27,159
Robert, no words. On your knees.

1381
01:52:27,701 --> 01:52:29,077
Do it.

1382
01:52:29,161 --> 01:52:30,787
No, I mean it. Down.

1383
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:34,666
Not you. No, my dear, you.

1384
01:52:37,294 --> 01:52:39,379
You're my miracle, Sophie.

1385
01:52:40,339 --> 01:52:42,799
You're the guardian of the Grail.

1386
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:47,429
All the oppression of the poor
and the powerless

1387
01:52:47,512 --> 01:52:50,474
of those of different skin, of women.

1388
01:52:50,557 --> 01:52:53,268
You can put an end to all that.

1389
01:52:54,019 --> 01:52:57,189
You must explode the truth onto the world.

1390
01:52:58,523 --> 01:52:59,983
It's your duty.

1391
01:53:02,903 --> 01:53:05,322
You know the answer to this riddle.

1392
01:53:07,115 --> 01:53:08,700
Open the cryptex,

1393
01:53:10,243 --> 01:53:11,954
and I'll put down the gun.

1394
01:53:30,097 --> 01:53:32,182
I have no idea how.

1395
01:53:32,265 --> 01:53:34,267
I don't know the code.

1396
01:53:34,351 --> 01:53:36,895
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

1397
01:53:42,651 --> 01:53:44,569
Like your grandfather, then.

1398
01:53:45,696 --> 01:53:48,198
Willing to die for your secret.

1399
01:53:49,866 --> 01:53:52,786
But, by the way
you've been looking at your hero,

1400
01:53:53,578 --> 01:53:57,916
I wonder, would you let him die for you?

1401
01:53:58,625 --> 01:54:01,003
Open it, Sophie, to save his life.

1402
01:54:01,086 --> 01:54:03,255
- Leigh, you can't just...
- Open the cryptex.

1403
01:54:03,922 --> 01:54:05,007
I don't know how.

1404
01:54:05,090 --> 01:54:07,134
Open it or he dies.

1405
01:54:07,217 --> 01:54:09,302
- I swear, I don't know.
- Do it! Do it!

1406
01:54:09,386 --> 01:54:10,679
- Stop it!
- I don't know!

1407
01:54:10,762 --> 01:54:12,097
Stop it!

1408
01:54:17,936 --> 01:54:19,938
She can't do it, Leigh.

1409
01:54:31,658 --> 01:54:33,535
But give... Give me a moment.

1410
01:54:43,712 --> 01:54:45,088
Robert.

1411
01:54:58,643 --> 01:54:59,686
What are you doing?

1412
01:55:00,395 --> 01:55:01,563
Please.

1413
01:56:21,768 --> 01:56:23,228
I'm sorry.

1414
01:56:33,405 --> 01:56:34,573
I'm sorry.

1415
01:56:37,367 --> 01:56:38,368
No!

1416
01:56:46,918 --> 01:56:48,253
No, Robert!

1417
01:56:49,004 --> 01:56:50,255
No!

1418
01:56:51,423 --> 01:56:52,424
No.

1419
01:56:52,716 --> 01:56:54,926
The map. It's ruined.

1420
01:57:02,434 --> 01:57:03,894
The map is ruined.

1421
01:57:04,895 --> 01:57:06,229
The Grail.

1422
01:57:06,730 --> 01:57:07,856
It's lost.

1423
01:57:08,565 --> 01:57:10,025
The Grail is gone.

1424
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:13,111
Only the worthy find the Grail, Leigh.

1425
01:57:14,237 --> 01:57:15,780
You taught me that.

1426
01:57:18,992 --> 01:57:20,535
Armed police!

1427
01:57:20,619 --> 01:57:22,120
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

1428
01:57:23,288 --> 01:57:24,331
Put the gun down.

1429
01:57:27,417 --> 01:57:29,753
Put the gun down.

1430
01:57:34,507 --> 01:57:37,469
That one. The old man.

1431
01:57:37,552 --> 01:57:38,553
You're under arrest!

1432
01:57:38,637 --> 01:57:41,014
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense

1433
01:57:41,097 --> 01:57:43,099
if you do not mention, when questioned

1434
01:57:43,183 --> 01:57:45,310
something which you later rely on in court.

1435
01:57:45,393 --> 01:57:48,104
Anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

1436
01:57:58,740 --> 01:58:01,034
I'll have some questions for you.

1437
01:58:18,677 --> 01:58:20,720
Robert! Robert!

1438
01:58:20,804 --> 01:58:22,639
Robert! How could you do it?

1439
01:58:22,722 --> 01:58:24,599
How could you? Robert!

1440
01:58:25,267 --> 01:58:27,602
To destroy our hope of freedom.

1441
01:58:27,978 --> 01:58:31,564
To deny every pilgrim the chance
to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.

1442
01:58:31,648 --> 01:58:32,649
How could you?

1443
01:58:37,362 --> 01:58:39,322
You couldn't! You solved it.

1444
01:58:41,783 --> 01:58:45,245
You took the scroll out before it broke!

1445
01:58:45,662 --> 01:58:47,914
You solved it. You'll find it, Robert.

1446
01:58:47,998 --> 01:58:49,624
You'll find it. You know what to do.

1447
01:58:49,708 --> 01:58:51,960
You'll find the Grail,
you'll kneel before her,

1448
01:58:52,043 --> 01:58:54,129
and you'll set her free upon the world!

1449
01:58:54,212 --> 01:58:57,340
That man there,
he's got the map to the Holy Grail!

1450
01:59:08,226 --> 01:59:12,731
There was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one.

1451
01:59:14,024 --> 01:59:16,359
The orb which fell from the heavens

1452
01:59:16,443 --> 01:59:18,111
and inspired Newton's life's work.

1453
01:59:18,194 --> 01:59:23,283
Work that incurred the wrath
of the Church until his dying day.

1454
01:59:26,578 --> 01:59:28,038
A-P-P-L-E.

1455
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:30,290
Apple.

1456
01:59:44,929 --> 01:59:48,016
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits.

1457
01:59:48,099 --> 01:59:50,477
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er Her gates

1458
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:52,520
"Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies

1459
01:59:52,604 --> 01:59:56,358
"She rests at last beneath
the starry skies"

1460
01:59:58,443 --> 02:00:00,403
I think I know where she's gone.

1461
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:03,782
I think the Grail has gone home.

1462
02:00:23,676 --> 02:00:26,179
Built by the Templars themselves.

1463
02:00:26,262 --> 02:00:28,598
Named for the original Rose Line.

1464
02:00:28,681 --> 02:00:30,558
Rosslyn Chapel.

1465
02:00:31,726 --> 02:00:33,478
So this is it.

1466
02:00:34,479 --> 02:00:36,356
The gift at the end.

1467
02:00:37,315 --> 02:00:41,069
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits."

1468
02:00:41,986 --> 02:00:44,781
You never told me the joke
Saunière made of you.

1469
02:00:45,490 --> 02:00:47,158
What was it?

1470
02:00:47,242 --> 02:00:49,452
He called me a flatfoot.

1471
02:00:49,536 --> 02:00:51,454
A beat cop of history.

1472
02:00:52,539 --> 02:00:54,165
A dumb policeman,

1473
02:00:54,833 --> 02:00:58,336
who just does his job
day after day, of history.

1474
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:00,130
You know, his father was one.

1475
02:01:00,839 --> 02:01:02,757
A policeman.

1476
02:01:02,841 --> 02:01:07,554
Saunière said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known.

1477
02:01:11,433 --> 02:01:14,102
We are who we protect, I think.

1478
02:01:14,978 --> 02:01:16,688
What we stand up for.

1479
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:30,076
Jewish.

1480
02:01:31,202 --> 02:01:33,913
Christian, Egyptian.

1481
02:01:35,206 --> 02:01:37,625
Masonic, pagan.

1482
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:40,420
Templar crosses.

1483
02:01:41,045 --> 02:01:42,422
Pyramids.

1484
02:01:43,173 --> 02:01:47,051
I think I've been here before.

1485
02:01:47,135 --> 02:01:48,344
Sophie?

1486
02:02:08,156 --> 02:02:09,866
A very long time ago.

1487
02:02:12,243 --> 02:02:14,078
Come along, Sophie.

1488
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:30,303
Sophie.

1489
02:02:31,346 --> 02:02:32,472
Over here.

1490
02:02:40,230 --> 02:02:43,775
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er Her gates."

1491
02:02:44,275 --> 02:02:46,778
Pagan symbols for male and female.

1492
02:02:48,613 --> 02:02:50,740
Fused as one.

1493
02:02:50,823 --> 02:02:52,951
As the pagans would have wanted.

1494
02:02:54,702 --> 02:02:56,412
We're about to close, I'm afraid.

1495
02:03:02,669 --> 02:03:05,004
We're just gonna be a moment.

1496
02:03:19,852 --> 02:03:21,145
Robert.

1497
02:03:47,255 --> 02:03:50,425
"Adorned in masters' loving art, she lies."

1498
02:03:50,508 --> 02:03:55,930
"She rests at last beneath
the starry skies."

1499
02:04:15,533 --> 02:04:17,201
The fleur-de-lis.

1500
02:05:08,294 --> 02:05:09,379
She was here.

1501
02:05:12,423 --> 02:05:13,966
Her sarcophagus.

1502
02:05:16,052 --> 02:05:17,637
Mary Magdalene.

1503
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:21,349
The Holy Grail herself.

1504
02:05:23,017 --> 02:05:24,644
She was here.

1505
02:05:24,727 --> 02:05:26,354
Where did she go?

1506
02:05:27,438 --> 02:05:29,816
Did the Church finally get her?

1507
02:05:44,330 --> 02:05:47,041
This is incredible. Look at this.

1508
02:05:47,125 --> 02:05:50,461
Look at this.
These records go back thousands of years.

1509
02:05:51,629 --> 02:05:54,132
They date back to the death of Christ.

1510
02:05:56,801 --> 02:06:00,138
Good God, could these
really be the Grail documents?

1511
02:06:22,201 --> 02:06:26,080
What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?

1512
02:06:27,582 --> 02:06:30,251
How was I ever supposed to
figure all this out?

1513
02:06:30,626 --> 02:06:33,004
When you and your grandfather fought,

1514
02:06:33,087 --> 02:06:35,798
was it something about your past?

1515
02:06:37,759 --> 02:06:39,510
How could you know that?

1516
02:06:40,178 --> 02:06:42,889
About how your parents died?

1517
02:06:43,973 --> 02:06:45,516
Sophie?

1518
02:06:47,894 --> 02:06:50,146
It was during primary school.

1519
02:06:51,731 --> 02:06:53,733
I was in his library.

1520
02:06:55,526 --> 02:06:57,195
Doing research.

1521
02:06:57,278 --> 02:06:59,906
I was trying to find out about my family.

1522
02:07:00,072 --> 02:07:02,366
Sophie, where are you, princess?

1523
02:07:03,159 --> 02:07:05,453
I wanted to know about them.

1524
02:07:06,245 --> 02:07:08,206
But I couldn't find any records.

1525
02:07:09,332 --> 02:07:11,209
Not of their death,

1526
02:07:12,710 --> 02:07:14,462
not of the accident.

1527
02:07:15,421 --> 02:07:17,924
I'd asked him for as long
as I could remember,

1528
02:07:18,007 --> 02:07:19,175
but he would never tell me.

1529
02:07:19,258 --> 02:07:20,968
I told you, no.

1530
02:07:23,387 --> 02:07:24,889
But why can't I?

1531
02:07:25,223 --> 02:07:27,058
He stood over me,

1532
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:30,812
and he wouldn't let me leave.

1533
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:32,855
They're dead. Dead and buried.

1534
02:07:33,356 --> 02:07:35,024
Never look for them, Sophie.

1535
02:07:35,274 --> 02:07:36,484
Promise me.

1536
02:07:37,944 --> 02:07:39,070
Swear it!

1537
02:07:39,779 --> 02:07:40,905
Swear it to me!

1538
02:07:51,582 --> 02:07:53,543
I kept my promise.

1539
02:07:57,171 --> 02:07:59,465
The next week he sent
me to boarding school.

1540
02:08:01,676 --> 02:08:04,637
One weekend, I came home unexpectedly.

1541
02:08:06,264 --> 02:08:08,349
And what I saw my grandfather doing...

1542
02:08:09,976 --> 02:08:11,602
Some ritual.

1543
02:08:13,604 --> 02:08:15,189
I was so frightened.

1544
02:08:19,861 --> 02:08:22,029
We hardly ever spoke again.

1545
02:08:25,658 --> 02:08:27,285
Do you have any...

1546
02:08:28,077 --> 02:08:30,788
Any memories of your grandfather
before the accident?

1547
02:08:31,873 --> 02:08:33,624
Before your parents were killed?

1548
02:08:34,709 --> 02:08:37,295
Yeah. No, I don't know.

1549
02:08:38,462 --> 02:08:39,630
Why?

1550
02:08:42,383 --> 02:08:44,760
Because I don't think
he was your grandfather.

1551
02:09:04,238 --> 02:09:05,948
These are my parents.

1552
02:09:08,242 --> 02:09:09,577
My brother.

1553
02:09:11,412 --> 02:09:13,205
And this is you, isn't it?

1554
02:09:18,169 --> 02:09:21,839
The paper says the entire
family was killed.

1555
02:09:22,340 --> 02:09:25,676
The mother, the father, the boy, six.

1556
02:09:27,929 --> 02:09:30,139
And the girl, four.

1557
02:09:31,849 --> 02:09:34,936
But your name was never Saunière.

1558
02:09:35,019 --> 02:09:36,562
It's Saint-Clair.

1559
02:09:39,941 --> 02:09:42,276
It's one of the oldest families in France.

1560
02:09:42,944 --> 02:09:46,197
It's from a line of the Merovingian kings.

1561
02:09:55,289 --> 02:09:57,083
Royal blood.

1562
02:09:59,126 --> 02:10:00,711
I was so wrong.

1563
02:10:02,380 --> 02:10:06,676
Saunière didn't want you
to help guard the secret of the Holy Grail.

1564
02:10:08,386 --> 02:10:09,720
Sophie,

1565
02:10:12,223 --> 02:10:14,058
you are the secret.

1566
02:10:15,726 --> 02:10:17,645
You survived the accident.

1567
02:10:18,479 --> 02:10:21,232
If it even was an accident.

1568
02:10:21,315 --> 02:10:23,234
The Priory found out.

1569
02:10:23,901 --> 02:10:27,071
Somehow they concealed the fact
that you were alive.

1570
02:10:27,613 --> 02:10:30,574
They hid you with the Grand Master himself,

1571
02:10:31,492 --> 02:10:33,452
who raised you as his own.

1572
02:10:34,745 --> 02:10:36,539
According to all of this,

1573
02:10:37,999 --> 02:10:39,750
Princess Sophie,

1574
02:10:43,462 --> 02:10:45,089
you are the heir.

1575
02:10:47,133 --> 02:10:49,218
The end of the bloodline.

1576
02:10:50,803 --> 02:10:53,848
You are the last living descendent

1577
02:10:55,182 --> 02:10:57,018
of Jesus Christ.

1578
02:11:42,563 --> 02:11:43,939
What is this?

1579
02:11:45,983 --> 02:11:47,193
Sophie?

1580
02:11:50,446 --> 02:11:51,572
Who are you?

1581
02:11:51,655 --> 02:11:54,617
There have been many names.

1582
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:56,327
The keepers.

1583
02:11:57,369 --> 02:11:59,163
Guardians.

1584
02:11:59,246 --> 02:12:01,791
The Priory of Sion.

1585
02:12:01,874 --> 02:12:06,921
But to you, Sophie, we are friends
of the man who raised you,

1586
02:12:07,588 --> 02:12:09,173
Jacques Saunière.

1587
02:12:11,592 --> 02:12:14,303
He would have wanted you to know

1588
02:12:14,386 --> 02:12:16,889
that he loved you very much.

1589
02:12:17,932 --> 02:12:22,019
And that the Priory are here
to protect you now

1590
02:12:22,103 --> 02:12:25,272
as they have always protected our family.

1591
02:12:27,858 --> 02:12:29,944
I gave you up once

1592
02:12:30,736 --> 02:12:33,531
knowing I might never see you again.

1593
02:12:37,243 --> 02:12:39,161
I'm your grandmother, Sophie.

1594
02:12:40,287 --> 02:12:43,707
I have prayed for this moment

1595
02:12:43,791 --> 02:12:45,668
for a very long time.

1596
02:12:47,294 --> 02:12:49,421
Welcome home, child.

1597
02:13:02,268 --> 02:13:03,477
Hey.

1598
02:13:13,821 --> 02:13:17,658
She has some things she wants to tell me.

1599
02:13:18,659 --> 02:13:21,036
About my family.

1600
02:13:27,543 --> 02:13:28,752
What will you do?

1601
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:33,424
The legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself.

1602
02:13:34,258 --> 02:13:36,760
They just got the pronoun wrong.

1603
02:13:40,181 --> 02:13:41,807
She said when Saunière died

1604
02:13:41,891 --> 02:13:44,685
he took the location
of Mary's sarcophagus with him.

1605
02:13:44,768 --> 02:13:49,398
So there's no way to empirically prove
that I am related to her.

1606
02:13:52,151 --> 02:13:54,111
What would you do, Robert?

1607
02:13:55,070 --> 02:13:57,281
Okay, maybe there is no proof.

1608
02:13:57,364 --> 02:13:59,533
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.

1609
02:13:59,617 --> 02:14:03,329
But, Sophie, the only thing that matters
is what you believe.

1610
02:14:04,747 --> 02:14:07,875
History shows us
Jesus was an extraordinary man.

1611
02:14:07,958 --> 02:14:09,960
A human inspiration. That's it.

1612
02:14:10,836 --> 02:14:13,547
That's all the evidence has ever proved.

1613
02:14:15,007 --> 02:14:16,133
But...

1614
02:14:17,092 --> 02:14:18,969
When I was a boy...

1615
02:14:21,305 --> 02:14:25,184
When I was down in that well
Teabing told you about,

1616
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:30,981
I thought I was going to die, Sophie.

1617
02:14:33,108 --> 02:14:35,236
What I did,

1618
02:14:35,319 --> 02:14:36,695
I prayed.

1619
02:14:38,030 --> 02:14:39,615
I prayed

1620
02:14:39,698 --> 02:14:42,660
to Jesus to keep me alive,

1621
02:14:42,743 --> 02:14:44,286
so I could see my parents again,

1622
02:14:44,370 --> 02:14:46,455
so I could go to school again,

1623
02:14:47,498 --> 02:14:49,750
so I could play with my dog.

1624
02:14:51,126 --> 02:14:54,129
Sometimes I wonder
if I wasn't alone down there.

1625
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:59,176
Why does it have to be human or divine?

1626
02:14:59,260 --> 02:15:01,178
Maybe human is divine.

1627
02:15:02,471 --> 02:15:04,139
Why couldn't Jesus have been a father

1628
02:15:04,223 --> 02:15:07,017
and still been capable
of all those miracles?

1629
02:15:07,685 --> 02:15:10,479
Like turning water into wine?

1630
02:15:10,562 --> 02:15:13,691
Well, who knows? His blood is your blood.

1631
02:15:14,525 --> 02:15:17,611
Maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again.

1632
02:15:18,195 --> 02:15:21,323
Maybe you healed my phobia with your hands.

1633
02:15:21,407 --> 02:15:24,410
And maybe you're a knight on a Grail quest.

1634
02:15:27,246 --> 02:15:29,790
Well, here's the question.

1635
02:15:30,666 --> 02:15:33,377
A living descendent of Jesus Christ,

1636
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:37,464
would she destroy faith?

1637
02:15:38,007 --> 02:15:40,884
Or would she renew it?

1638
02:15:43,554 --> 02:15:46,724
So again I say,
what matters is what you believe.

1639
02:15:49,059 --> 02:15:50,352
Thank you.

1640
02:15:52,521 --> 02:15:53,731
For bringing me here.

1641
02:15:55,774 --> 02:15:58,277
For letting him choose you,

1642
02:15:59,153 --> 02:16:00,362
Sir Robert.

1643
02:16:10,622 --> 02:16:11,623
You take care.

1644
02:16:13,208 --> 02:16:14,335
Yes.

1645
02:16:38,942 --> 02:16:40,110
Hey.

1646
02:16:53,123 --> 02:16:54,124
Nope.

1647
02:16:55,459 --> 02:16:57,711
Maybe I'll do better with the wine.

1648
02:17:01,131 --> 02:17:02,508
Godspeed.

1649
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:02,776
Bloodline.

1650
02:18:06,196 --> 02:18:07,531
Rose Line.

1651
02:18:14,329 --> 02:18:16,373
"Hides beneath the Rose."

1652
02:19:07,925 --> 02:19:11,512
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits.

1653
02:19:14,681 --> 02:19:18,101
"Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies.

1654
02:19:34,243 --> 02:19:37,871
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er Her gates.

1655
02:20:17,327 --> 02:20:20,831
"She rests at last beneath starry skies."
