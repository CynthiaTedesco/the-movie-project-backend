00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nick, this was a tragedy,
but it's not why we're here.</font>

2
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, are we fighting the weather now?</font>

3
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Locals say the cyclone had a face.</font>

4
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People see things
when they're under stress.</font>

5
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">OK. That does not mean that this is the start
to some other big world-ending...</font>

6
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

7
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want any part of this.</font>

8
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gone but not forgotten.</font>

9
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks to Kenneth Lim
and Vihaan Ramamurthy</font>

10
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for their help
with that touching video tribute.</font>

11
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:09,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This year has been nothing short of...
- **** is crazy. It's like insane.</font>

12
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jason.
- What?</font>

13
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No swearing.</font>

14
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the last day of school. We're good.</font>

15
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Historic.</font>

16
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over 5 years ago,
half of all life in the universe,</font>

17
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>including our own Midtown High,
was wiped from existence.</i></font>

18
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then 8 months ago,
a band of brave heroes</font>

19
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>brought us back.</i></font>

20
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They called it "the Blip."</font>

21
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Those of us who Blipped away
came back the same age...</i></font>

22
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But our classmates that didn't Blip
had grown 5 years older.</i></font>

23
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah like my little brother is now older than me.
- Yeah, it's math.</font>

24
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And even though we had Blipped away
halfway through the school year</font>

25
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and had already taken midterms,</font>

26
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the school made us start the whole year
over from the beginning.</font>

27
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's totally unfair.</font>

28
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not right.</font>

29
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:59,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tigers, it's been a long, dramatic,
somewhat confusing road.</font>

30
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>As we draw this year to a close,</i></font>

31
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>it's time to move on...</i></font>

32
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- to a new phase of our lives.
- Pray nothing crazy happens again</i></font>

33
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>because are the Avengers even
a thing anymore?</i></font>

34
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Does anyone even have a plan?</i>
- I have a plan.</font>

35
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, first, I'm gonna sit
next to MJ on the flight.</font>

36
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Second, I'm gonna buy
a dual-headphone adapter</font>

37
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and watch movies with her
the whole time.</font>

38
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Three, when we go to Venice...</font>

39
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Venice is super famous for making stuff
out of glass, right?</font>

40
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- True.
- So I'm gonna buy her</font>

41
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a black dahlia necklace because
her favorite flower is the black dahlia</font>

42
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- because of, well...
- The murder.</font>

43
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The murder. Four, when we go to Paris,</font>

44
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna take her to the top
of the Eiffel Tower,</font>

45
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">give her the necklace.</font>

46
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, five, I'm gonna tell her how I feel.</font>

47
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, six, hopefully she tells me
she feels the same way.</font>

48
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, don't forget step seven.</font>

49
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Step seven?
- Don't do any of that.</font>

50
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why?
- Caues we're gonna be bachelors in Europe Peter.</font>

51
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ned.
- Look,</font>

52
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I may not know much, but I do know this:</font>

53
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Europeans love Americans.</font>

54
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- And more than half of them are women.</font>

55
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Sure.</font>

56
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I really like MJ, man, okay?</font>

57
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's awesome, she's super funny
in a kind of dark way.</font>

58
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And sometimes I catch her looking at me,
and I feel like I've stood up...</font>

59
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She's coming. Don't say anything.
- What up, dorks?</font>

60
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excited about the science trip?
- Hey, Yeah we're just talking about the trip.</font>

61
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, and Peter's plan.
- You have a plan?</font>

62
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't... I don't have a plan.</font>

63
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he's just gonna collect tiny spoons
when we're traveling to other countries.</font>

64
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a grandmother?</font>

65
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not collecting tiny spoons.
He's collecting tiny spoons.</font>

66
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, okay, well...</font>

67
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that was a real roller coaster.</font>

68
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, travel tip:</font>

69
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should probably download a VPN
on your phone,</font>

70
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just so the government can't track you
while we're abroad.</font>

71
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smart. Will do.</font>

72
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, I think that went really great.</font>

73
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I Blipped back to my apartment,</font>

74
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the family that was living there
was very confused.</font>

75
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The wife thought that I was a mistress.</font>

76
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:07,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The grandma thought that I was a ghost.
It was... It was really a mess.</font>

77
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you all for coming out</font>

78
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to support those who have been
displaced by the Blip.</font>

79
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, of course,
thanks to our very own Spider-Man!</font>

80
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Miss Parker, for having me.</font>

81
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And thank you, you guys, for having me.</font>

82
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And thank you, Spider-Man.</font>

83
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll be right back out
to take photos and videos. Thank you!</font>

84
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That was amazing.
- That was great.</font>

85
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:51,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That was so cool. I was so nervous.
- I'm sorry I was a little stiff. I feel like I wasn't in the pocket.</font>

86
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No. May I thought you did great.
- I actually think you were a little stiff.</font>

87
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I felt that too. I felt that too.</font>

88
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's fine, it's fine.
- Okay.</font>

89
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you get your passport?
- Yeah.</font>

90
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mini toothpaste?
- Yeah, I did.</font>

91
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, sorry I'm late.</font>

92
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Happy. Hey.
- Oh, you look lovely.</font>

93
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks. You too.
- Thank you.</font>

94
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- New dress?
- Yeah, yes, it is.</font>

95
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's a new beard.
- It's my... My Blip beard.</font>

96
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I grew it in the Blip.</font>

97
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a Blip beard.</font>

98
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see. Yeah.</font>

99
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway so the reason I'm late is
because this was misplaced at the office.</font>

100
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you believe it? Because
it's enormous. I mean not the amount, the size.</font>

101
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The amount's nice too. They're very generous.</font>

102
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pepper Potts said, sorry she couldn't be here.
- Yeah. Thank you.</font>

103
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:36,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm gonna go change
the Sterno under the vegan lasagna.</font>

104
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spider-Man, go shake hands.</font>

105
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will do.</font>

106
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What just happened?</font>

107
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heads up, Nick Fury's calling you.</font>

108
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nick Fury's gonna call me? Why?
- Yeah.</font>

109
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why? Because he probably has hero stuff
for you to do.</font>

110
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a superhero.
He calls superheroes.</font>

111
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I mean If it really that important,
he'd probably call someone else, not me.</font>

112
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Apparently not.</font>

113
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No caller ID. That's him.
- I don't really wanna talk to Nick Fury.</font>

114
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Answer the phone.
- Why?</font>

115
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because If you don't talk to him, Na.. I have to talk,
and I don't want to talk to him.</font>

116
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why don't you wanna talk to him?
- Because I'm scared. Just answer the phone.</font>

117
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You sent Nick Fury to voicemail?
- Yeah.</font>

118
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You don't send Nick Fury to voicemail.
- Did you hear that? They're calling me.</font>

119
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I gotta go.
- You gotta talk to him.</font>

120
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna call him.
I promise you, I'm gonna call him. I will.</font>

121
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do not ghost Nick Fury.</font>

122
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise you, I'll call him.</font>

123
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After my trip.</font>

124
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:33,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

125
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, hi... No, no, he's not ghosting you.</font>

126
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, one question at a time.</font>

127
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you the head Avenger?
Are you the head Avenger now?</font>

128
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm not.</font>

129
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the aliens come back,
what are you gonna do?</font>

130
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the aliens come back, what will you gonna do?</font>

131
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does anyone have
any neighborhood questions?</font>

132
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sean Winford, <i>Queens Tribune.</i></font>

133
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What it is like to take over
from Tony Stark?</font>

134
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are some big shoes to fill.</font>

135
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm... I'm gonna go.
Thanks so much, everyone, for coming.</font>

136
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

137
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hungry?</font>

138
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So sorry.</font>

139
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought that you could sense that
with your Peter-tingle.</font>

140
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please do not start calling it
my Peter-tingle.</font>

141
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what's up? You can dodge bullets
but not bananas?</font>

142
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I just really need this vacation.
I need a break.</font>

143
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:13,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You deserve it.</font>

144
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

145
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:18,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?</font>

146
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should pack your suit, just in case.
I have a tingle about it.</font>

147
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please stop saying "tingle," May.</font>

148
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

149
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, I'm not.</font>

150
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah!
- Can you help me get my stuff up here?</font>

151
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, sorry, that's mine.
- No worries.</font>

152
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Middle seat gets both armrests.
- Give me a tablet.</font>

153
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want the first shift
or the second? I could take either.</font>

154
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien.</font>

155
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't chaperone these kids alone.
- Yo, Parker.</font>

156
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is called an airplane.
It's like the buses you're used to,</font>

157
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">except it flies over the poor neighborhoods
instead of driving through them.</font>

158
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ma'am?</font>

159
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He Blipped, so technically,
he's 16, not 21.</font>

160
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take that.</font>

161
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's lying. I don't even know this girl.</font>

162
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Classic MJ, right?</font>

163
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know Brad was coming?</font>

164
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It... It's so weird.</font>

165
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One day, he's that little kid who cried
and got nosebleeds all the time,</font>

166
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and suddenly, we Blip back,</font>

167
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he's totally ripped and super nice
and all these girls are after him.</font>

168
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not all the girls are after him.
- No, man, they're all after him.</font>

169
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Here.</font>

170
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, on to more important things.</font>

171
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:46,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a 9-hour flight. We can play
<i>Beast Slayers</i> the whole time.</font>

172
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you excited?</font>

173
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need your help to sit next to MJ.</font>

174
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.</font>

175
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about our plan?
American bachelors in Europe.</font>

176
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's your plan. That's a solo plan.
Come on, this is my plan.</font>

177
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

178
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys.</font>

179
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:14,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's an old lady sitting in front of us
wearing a crazy amount of perfume,</font>

180
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's kind of setting off
Peter's allergies.</font>

181
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know Betty, if you could switch seats with him,
that would be...</font>

182
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's allergic to perfume?</font>

183
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, because it...</font>

184
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It makes his eyes water,</font>

185
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and he can't really...
- Peter has a perfume allergy?</font>

186
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tell you from experience,
perfume allergies are no joke.</font>

187
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can feel hives breaking out already.
MJ, stand up.</font>

188
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ned, take MJ's spot.
MJ, you take my spot.</font>

189
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter, come with me let's get you out of there.</font>

190
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry.
- Zach and Sebastian,</font>

191
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- you take Ned and Peter's seats.
- That's all right.</font>

192
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ned, thanks for bringing this
to my attention.</font>

193
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your safety is my responsibility.
And Mr. Dell's, but he's...</font>

194
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it for now. Let's go, Peter!</font>

195
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>

196
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I have a small bladder,
so I took the aisle.</font>

197
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So did you want to play <i>Beast Slayer?</i></font>

198
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope.</font>

199
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever played
any kind of PC game or...?</font>

200
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Got it.</font>

201
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I tell you
how my wife pretended to Blip out?</font>

202
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turns out, she ran off
with a guy in her hiking group.</font>

203
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had a fake funeral for her.</font>

204
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the funeral was real
because I thought she was really dead.</font>

205
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanna see the video?</font>

206
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I got a dual-headphone adapter
if you want to watch a movie.</font>

207
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only if it's depressing. Or hilarious.</font>

208
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you have a dual-headphone adapter.
We can watch together.</font>

209
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Good afternoon ladies and gentleman,
this is your captain speaking.</i></font>

210
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Our flight time today will be 8 hours,
49 minutes to Venice, Italy.</i></font>

211
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice picture.</font>

212
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey man, did you see Brad and MJ
on the plane?</font>

213
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were watching movies
and laughing the entire time.</font>

214
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, don't worry, okay?</font>

215
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sure that's nothing.
- Hey, babe.</font>

216
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you hold this for me please?</font>

217
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.</font>

218
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>

219
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we actually got to talking on the plane,
and it turns out,</font>

220
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we have a lot in common.</font>

221
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we're boyfriend and girlfriend now.</font>

222
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever happened to being
an American bachelor in Europe?</font>

223
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter, those were the words of a boy.</font>

224
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that boy met a woman.</font>

225
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A very strong and powerful woman.</font>

226
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now that boy's a man.</font>

227
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Babe?
- Coming, babe.</font>

228
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing in there. I swear.</font>

229
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These, no.</font>

230
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. Sorry.</font>

231
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm here. Mr. Harrington.
- Wait, wait, wait.</font>

232
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm here, I'm here.
- Oh, thank goodness.</font>

233
00:16:56,599 --> 00:17:00,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like we're here.
They're doing some renovations to the place.</font>

234
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Getting some upgrades.
- Oh, this is trash.</font>

235
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That must be the concierge.
- Okay.</font>

236
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, man.</font>

237
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone, here we are.</font>

238
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tell me we're not staying here.
- Come on in.</font>

239
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This place is sinking.</font>

240
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I think you mean, "charming."
- It stinks.</font>

241
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, everybody, drop your bags off.</font>

242
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna meet
at the Da Vinci Museum at 3. Let's go!</font>

243
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Vamonos!
- It's "andiamo."</i></font>

244
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Andiamo!</i>
- There you go.</font>

245
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When in Rome, do as the Romans do.</font>

246
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you're in Venice,
your socks get wet.</font>

247
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up, Flash Mob?
How you guys doing?</font>

248
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here in St. Marco Polo's...</font>

249
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is so much fun.
- Yeah?</font>

250
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 3, 2, 1.
- Say "pizza."</font>

251
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pizza!
- Pizza time!</font>

252
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

253
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm looking for a...</font>

254
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's perfect.</font>

255
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:57,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

256
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Its the most perfect word in the world.
Italians created it, And I just discovered it.</font>

257
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What does it mean?
- That's the thing it can mean a million things.</font>

258
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can mean "I don't know." "Get out of my face."</font>

00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I don't know" and "Get out of my face."</font>

260
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the best thing Italy created,
except for, maybe, espresso.</font>

261
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, so you've been drinking espresso.</font>

262
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. German? American.</font>

263
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A rose for you.</font>

264
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Boh"</i> is my new superpower.</font>

265
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like the anti-"aloha."
I was born to say this word.</font>

266
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's in the bag?</font>

267
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice.</font>

268
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, cool.</font>

269
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>

270
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Betty! You okay?
- Yeah.</font>

271
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God!
- Come on.</font>

272
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, we gotta go!</font>

273
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is that?
- I don't know.</font>

274
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What'll you do?
- Left my suit in the hotel room.</font>

275
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why?
- I'm on vacation, Ned!</font>

276
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone will gonna see my face.
Get them out of here.</font>

277
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go!
- Just go!</font>

278
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of here. Go!</font>

279
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

280
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

281
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, you don't.</font>

282
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay? Get out of here. Go!</font>

283
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, sir!</font>

284
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I can help. Let me help.</font>

285
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm really strong, and I'm sticky.</font>

286
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to lead it away from the canals.</font>

287
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Da Vinci Museum.
This is why we're here in Venice.</font>

288
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, this is it.</font>

289
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:01,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's closed.</font>

290
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean its closed? Till when?</font>

291
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:04,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">November.</font>

292
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You didn't check the website?
- Oh, that's a good idea.</font>

293
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:23,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on.</font>

294
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay low, kids. We'll be safe here.</font>

295
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is that guy?</font>

296
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know,
but he's kicking that water's ass.</font>

297
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! Yeah!</font>

298
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's aliens. It has to be.</font>

299
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">BuzzFeed says there's a sailor
named Morris Bench</font>

300
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who was exposed to an experimental
underwater generator</font>

301
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and got hydro powers.</font>

302
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you should definitely believe
everything you read on the Internet.</font>

303
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Spider-Man could take him.
- What do you think it is?</font>

304
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know being a man of science...</font>

305
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">witches.</font>

306
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. We wanna stay.</font>

307
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good thing I packed your suit huh.</font>

308
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- I can't believe you forgot it.</i>
- Yeah.</font>

309
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So who was that guy that you were with?
Was that Mr. Strange?</font>

310
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:55,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange.
And, no, I don't know who that was.</font>

311
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:56,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It was a new guy.</i></font>

312
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:59,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I was trying to help him...
- Happy, that's my lunch.</font>

313
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't eat that one.</font>

314
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Happy's there?
- Yeah, it's Happy.</font>

315
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's here. He came by to volunteer.</font>

316
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And he's hanging around the office.</i></font>

317
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And he wants to say hi.
- I don't want... Hi, Peter.</font>

318
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Happy.</font>

319
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:17,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, I'm working really hard here.
I gotta do a... A leaflet drop.</font>

320
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing...?
<i>- Glad you're having a good time.</i></font>

321
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry,
I'm really taking care of your aunt.</font>

322
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So how's the plan going?</font>

323
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's been setbacks, for sure.</font>

324
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't overthink it.
Trust your instincts and you'll be fine.</font>

325
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I know. Love you.</i></font>

326
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>

327
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is that guy?</font>

328
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's like Iron Man and Thor
rolled into one.</font>

329
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's all right. He's no Spider-Man.</font>

330
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it with you and Spider-Man?</font>

331
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? He's just awesome, okay?</font>

332
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He protects the neighborhood
and you know he's inspiring.</font>

333
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He inspires me to be a better man.</font>

334
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up, dickwad?
Thought you drowned.</font>

335
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds like his name's Mysterio.</font>

336
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"L'uomo del misterio"</i> is Italian
for "man of mystery."</font>

337
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They don't actually know who he is.
- Mysterio.</font>

338
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cool name.
- Cool name.</font>

339
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Babe.
- Babe.</font>

340
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So how much of that did you actually see?</font>

341
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not much. I was running.</font>

342
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Me too. I was also running...</font>

343
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:22,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">away.</font>

344
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Paris tomorrow.</font>

345
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great.</font>

346
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I read it was secretly built
as a mind-control antenna</font>

347
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to create an army of the insane.</font>

348
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is why it's my favorite destination
on the whole trip.</font>

349
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you gonna do about
the water monster?</font>

350
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

351
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:48,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's dead.
And besides, that Mysterio guy's all over it.</font>

352
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look I just wanna spend some time with MJ.</font>

353
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:53,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were talking about Paris,
and I think she really likes me.</font>

354
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's nice.</font>

355
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reminds me
of when Betty and I first fell in love.</font>

356
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had just finished
my fruit cobbler, right, and...</font>

357
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:07,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a very difficult person
to contact, Spider-Man.</font>

358
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're Nick Fury.</font>

359
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you just shot Ned.</font>

360
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a mild tranquilizer. He'll be all right.</font>

361
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So good to finally meet you.</font>

362
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw you at the funeral,</font>

363
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I didn't think that was a good time
to exchange numbers.</font>

364
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. That would've been inappropriate.</font>

365
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's what I just said.
- Right.</font>

366
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:32,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The important thing is, you're here.
I tried to bring you here.</font>

367
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You avoided me, and now you're here.</font>

368
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a coincidence.</font>

369
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. Was this a coincidence?</font>

370
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to know everything.</font>

371
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I come back 5 years later,
and now I know nothing.</font>

372
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No intel, no team.</font>

373
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And a high school kid</font>

374
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is dodging my calls.</font>

375
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's what I do know:</font>

376
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:04,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A week ago, a village in Mexico
was wiped out by a cyclone.</font>

377
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.</font>

378
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:16,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 days later,
a similar event in Morocco.</font>

379
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A village was...</font>

380
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just making the rounds.</font>

381
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See if anyone needs any emotional counseling
after today's traumatic events.</font>

382
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we'll be okay. We're fine. Thank you.</font>

383
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great because I'm...
I'm not qualified to actually...</font>

384
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, he's passed out.</font>

385
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not qualified to do it anyway,
so good night.</font>

386
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:39,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was my teacher. Sorry about that.
You were saying?</font>

387
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A village was destroyed by what
may well be another world-threatening...</font>

388
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:46,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Babe, you still awake?
You're not answering any of my texts.</font>

389
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's asleep, Betty.</font>

390
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, already?</font>

391
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Okay.</font>

392
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why it's imperative...</font>

393
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, boys. So that canal water today
was filled with dangerous bacteria...</font>

394
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another person touches that door,
you and I are going to attend another funeral.</font>

395
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Suit up.
- Let me know if you develop vomiting.</font>

396
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark left these for you.</font>

397
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:11,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

398
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:26,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."</font>

399
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark said you wouldn't get that
because it's not a Star Wars reference.</font>

400
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can lose the mask.
Everyone here has seen you without it.</font>

401
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd be feigning anonymity</font>

402
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and breathing through spandex
for no good reason.</font>

403
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

404
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

405
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over there, we have Maria Hill.</font>

406
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is Dimitri.</font>

407
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this is Mr. Beck.</font>

408
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:08,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mysterio?</font>

409
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

410
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't matter. It's just what
my friends have been calling you.</font>

411
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you can call me Quentin.</font>

412
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You handled yourself well out there today.
I saw what you did with the tower.</font>

413
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could use someone like you
on my world.</font>

414
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

415
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. Your world?</font>

416
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Beck is from Earth.</font>

417
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just not yours.</font>

418
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are multiple realities Peter.</font>

419
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Earth Dimension 616.
I'm from Earth 833.</font>

420
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse?</font>

421
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I thought that was theoretical I mean.</font>

422
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That completely changes how we understand
the initial singularity.</font>

423
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're talking about
an eternal inflation system.</font>

424
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how does that even work
with all the quantum...?</font>

425
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's insane.</font>

426
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. It's really cool.</font>

427
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't ever apologize for being
the smartest one in the room.</font>

428
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway...</font>

429
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were born in stable orbits
within black holes.</font>

430
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Creatures formed
from the primary elements:</font>

431
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Air, water, fire, earth.</font>

432
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Science Division had
a technical name.</font>

433
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just called them Elementals.</font>

434
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Versions of them exist
across our mythologies.</font>

435
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turns out, the myths are real.</font>

436
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Thor.</font>

437
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor was a myth,
now I study him in my physics class.</font>

438
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These myths are threats.</font>

439
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They first materialized
on my Earth many years ago.</font>

440
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We mobilized and fought them,</font>

441
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but with each battle,
they grew, got stronger.</font>

442
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was part of the last battalion left
trying to stop them.</font>

443
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All we did was delay the inevitable.</font>

444
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Elementals are here now,
attacking the same coordinates.</font>

445
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our satellites confirm it.</font>

446
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank Mr. Beck for destroying
the other 3.</font>

447
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only one left: fire.</font>

448
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The strongest of them all.
The one that destroyed my Earth.</font>

449
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the one that took my family.</font>

450
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

451
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it will be in Prague
in approximately 48 hours.</font>

452
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:10,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have one mission: kill it.
And you're coming with us.</font>

453
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, did you say Prague?</font>

454
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:19,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime,
you know, huge superhero kind of stuff.</font>

455
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm just a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.</font>

456
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bitch, please. You've been to space.</font>

457
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, but that was an accident.
Sir, Come on.</font>

458
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's gotta be someone else
you can use.</font>

459
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What about Thor?
- Off-world.</font>

460
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Doctor Strange.</font>

461
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Unavailable.
- Captain Marvel.</font>

462
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't invoke her name.</font>

463
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, look, I wanna help. I do.</font>

464
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if my aunt finds out I left
my class trip, she's gonna kill me.</font>

465
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if I'm seen like this in Europe
after the Washington Monument,</font>

466
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my whole class will figure out who I am, then...</font>

467
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then the whole world will figure out
who I am, and then I'm done.</font>

468
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

469
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand.</font>

470
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, what?</font>

471
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you get back
before your teachers miss you</font>

472
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and become suspicious.</font>

473
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dimitri.</font>

474
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take him back to the hotel, please.</font>

475
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

476
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Mr. Fury.</font>

477
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And good luck.</font>

478
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you, kid.</font>

479
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, see you.</font>

480
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye, ma'am.
- Yeah.</font>

481
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">OK, Drink lots of water.
I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill.</font>

482
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You cannot get sick, okay babe?
- Okay. Thanks, baby.</font>

483
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey man, are you sure you're good?</font>

484
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, dude, I'm fine.</font>

485
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay. Nice.
- Don't worry.</font>

486
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously getting tranq'd in the neck by Nick Fury,</font>

487
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">probably the coolest thing
to ever happen to me anyway.</font>

488
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And it is pretty awesome.
- Yeah.</font>

489
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm just happy I don't have to go to Prague.
- Seriously.</font>

490
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good news. We're going to Prague.</font>

491
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Prague?</font>

492
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Tour company called.
They upgraded us.</font>

493
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should've heard me on the phone
with them. I really gave them hell.</font>

494
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I heard was crying.</font>

495
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look at our upgraded ride.
- Whoa, bro, you see that?</font>

496
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's pretty sick.</font>

497
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm impressed, Mr. Harrington.
- Oh, come on.</font>

498
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter, what...? What's going on?</font>

499
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think Nick Fury just hijacked
our summer vacation.</font>

500
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Mr. Harrington to the kids...</font>

501
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, all right.
- Okay.</font>

502
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awesome.</font>

503
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Awesome.</font>

504
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, what's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, the Big F,</font>

505
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">cruising through the Alps

523
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:13,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Don't look at it. Don't look at it.
That's wrong. That's wrong.</font>

524
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Petrol and toilets. 10 minutes!</font>

525
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flash Mob, this is what
we doing out here...</font>

526
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Toilet, toilet, toilet.
Which way to the toilet?</font>

527
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10 minutes, everyone.</font>

528
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dimitri, where exactly are we?</font>

529
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay. I'll figure it out.
- Oh, my gosh, it's so sick.</font>

530
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's beautiful.</font>

531
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

532
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

533
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close the door.</font>

534
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Peter Parker.</font>

535
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take off your clothes.</font>

536
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me?
- You told Fury</font>

537
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spider-Man cannot be seen in Europe.</font>

538
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I made you this, another suit.</font>

539
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thank you.</font>

540
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sure it fits fine. I don't need to try...
- Take off your clothes.</font>

541
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:30,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

542
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

543
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's a little embarrassing.
- Now. Hurry up.</font>

544
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is weird.</font>

545
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. Don't...</font>

546
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:51,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry. I thought this was the bathroom.
- This is not what it looks like.</font>

547
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just...
- Yeah.</font>

548
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- I'll leave you two alone.</font>

549
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Don't shoot anybody.
Brad? It's not what it looks like, buddy.</font>

550
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, man, look, that's...
- Look, Peter,</font>

551
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not here to judge
your life choices, dude.</font>

552
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want to hook up with some
random European chick on our school trip, that's on you.</font>

553
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's not what that was honestly.
- I can't pretend that I didn't see what I just saw.</font>

554
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you're trying
to get with MJ. It's obvious.</font>

555
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But I like her too.
- Wait a minute. Hey, hey.</font>

556
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You cannot show her that photo, dude come on.
- I'm sorry, man. I have to.</font>

557
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She deserves the truth.</font>

558
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, put your one foot
in front of the other,</font>

559
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and, everybody, back on the bus.</font>

560
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been 10 minutes. Let's go!</font>

561
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, Big F...</font>

562
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- EDITH?
<i>- Hello, Peter. How can I help you?</i></font>

563
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. There's this guy in my class
who's gonna ruin everything with MJ...</font>

564
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:43,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Peter, I'm having difficulty hearing you.
Can you please speak up?</i></font>

565
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brad Davis. He has a photo of me.</font>

566
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Brad Davis. Is he a target?</i></font>

567
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is Brad a target?</font>

568
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. He's a target. He's a target.
<i>- Copy that.</i></font>

569
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Target is Brad Davis. Initiating strike.</i></font>

570
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Initiating what, now?
<i>- Intercept point determined.</i></font>

571
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Releasing kill vehicle.</i>
- EDITH.</font>

572
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God.
- Dope glasses, Parker.</font>

573
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How'd you pay for these?
- Flash, give them back.</font>

574
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm really paying you a compliment.
- Please give me...</font>

575
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:38,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.</font>

576
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- EDITH, don't kill Brad.
<i>- Peter, Do you want me to cancel</i></font>

577
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- the drone strike on Brad Davis?</i>
- Did you just punch Flash?</font>

578
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
<i>- Firing.</i></font>

579
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, look out!</font>

580
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, this is not the autobahn!</font>

581
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- EDITH.
- Harrington!</font>

582
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is this the autobahn?
- Appears to be.</font>

583
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Commencing second strike.</i>
- Peter.</font>

584
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Plant your fanny in that seat and buckle up right now.
- Look at the baby mountain goats!</font>

585
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Baby mountain goats?
- I see them.</font>

586
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't see any mountain goats.</font>

587
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You missed them.</font>

588
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you think none of us
have noticed, Peter...</font>

589
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

590
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but your new look, I love it.</font>

591
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right, babe?
- Thanks.</font>

592
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Sophisticated, classy,
very European.</font>

593
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man.</font>

594
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's try that again.</font>

595
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is so weird.
It was right here on my phone.</font>

596
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I...
- Yeah. Weird.</font>

597
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Whoa, freaking beautiful.
- This is amazing.</font>

598
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, this place is so classy.</font>

599
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, so why are we here?</font>

600
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speak for yourself.</font>

601
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:29,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm home.</font>

602
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can I say?</font>

603
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The squeaky wheel gets
the upgrade grease.</font>

604
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:37,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone get settled in, rest up
because tonight, big surprise,</font>

605
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is Prague's annual Carnival of Lights.</font>

606
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah!
- Hello?</font>

607
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Parker, it's Hill.
There's an earpiece with your suit.</i></font>

608
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Put it on and await further instructions.
Understood?</i></font>

609
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am.</font>

610
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Yeah.</i>
- Hey, man.</font>

611
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- Look, I am so sorry</font>

612
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if I seem like I'm preoccupied
with my relationship.</font>

613
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know I'm still your guy in the chair.
- No, it's all good. Don't worry about it.</font>

614
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay. Great, great.
- It's fine.</font>

615
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's the status
on the Elemental thing?</font>

616
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where's it gonna happen?
- Here in the city.</font>

617
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Peter we are here.
- I know. It's not good.</font>

618
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm figuring it out.</font>

619
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:12,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to do something Peter, please.
We're counting on you.</font>

620
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ned.
- Yeah. Yeah, babe.</font>

621
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:17,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The good news is,
we've all got our own rooms.</font>

622
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's about time.
- Serious?</font>

623
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Parker? Parker!</i></font>

624
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:21,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

625
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That thing is going to be here
in a few hours.</font>

626
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we boring you?</font>

627
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not bored. He's thinking
about how you kidnapped him.</font>

628
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had obstacles.</font>

629
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I removed them.</font>

630
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They still won't evacuate the city.</font>

631
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Idiots.</font>

632
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's the plan, Parker?</font>

633
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:42,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will be in the cathedral tower,
keeping watch for the fire monster.</font>

634
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When that shows up,
I will radio you guys,</font>

635
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:48,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and then Mr. Beck and I will...
- My name is Mysterio.</font>

636
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's when Mysterio and I will move in.</font>

637
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter, listen to me.</font>

638
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The best hope you have, the only hope,</font>

639
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:01,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is to stop it here now,
no matter what the cost.</font>

640
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maneuver it away
from civilians if you can,</font>

641
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but most important,
keep it away from metal.</font>

642
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:10,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it gets too big, it'll draw power
from the Earth's core.</font>

643
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:13,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After that, there's no way to stop it.</font>

644
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, my friends are here.</font>

645
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't help but think
we're putting them in danger.</font>

646
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're worried about us
hurting your friends?</font>

647
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:29,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, who called a drone strike
on your own school tour bus?</font>

648
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:35,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark gave you a multibillion-dollar
A.R. tactical intelligence system,</font>

649
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the first thing you do with it is try
and blow up your friends.</font>

650
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:43,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's clear to me
that you were not ready for this.</font>

651
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nick Fury asked me to come up here
and see how you were doing.</font>

652
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just...
He felt bad about snapping at you.</font>

653
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

654
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys do have sarcasm
on this Earth, right?</font>

655
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you feeling?</font>

656
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't think I was gonna have
to save the world this summer.</font>

657
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that makes me sound
like such a jerk. I just...</font>

658
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:17,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had this plan with this girl
that I really like...</font>

659
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now it's all ruined.</font>

660
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not a jerk
for wanting a normal life, kid.</font>

661
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a hard path.</font>

662
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see things. You do things.
You make choices.</font>

663
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People look up to you...</font>

664
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and even if you win a battle,
sometimes they die.</font>

665
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like you, Peter. You're a good kid.</font>

666
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:52,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a part of me
that wants me to tell you, just...</font>

667
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">turn around, run away from all this.</font>

668
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:58,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then there's another part of me
that knows what we're about to fight,</font>

669
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what's at stake,
and I'm glad you're here.</font>

670
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me too.</font>

671
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're worried about your friends.</font>

672
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:07,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

673
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just always feel like
I'm putting them in danger.</font>

674
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:16,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, just get them inside and keep them
in a safe place for just a few hours.</font>

675
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:17,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll be all right.</font>

676
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:24,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's really nice to have somebody to talk to
about superhero stuff, you know?</font>

677
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:26,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anytime.</font>

678
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:32,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, hey, we survive this,
you'll have all summer to kill Brad.</font>

679
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you out there.</font>

680
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

681
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, that's Italian.</font>

682
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. EDITH? Oh, come on.</font>

683
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Hello, Peter.</i>
- Hey.</font>

684
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to find a way to keep my friends
inside the next few hours.</font>

685
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Let's see what we can do.</i></font>

686
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good news.</font>

687
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to the opera!</font>

688
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're kidding me.
- The opera?</font>

689
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:05,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't look at me.
- What happened to the carnival?</font>

690
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:07,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is upgrade living guys.</font>

691
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:11,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. The tour company
just gave us these tickets.</font>

692
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For free! Do you have any idea
how much opera tickets cost?</font>

693
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:18,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, because none of us have ever
wanted to go to the opera, ever.</font>

694
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this is gonna be
culturally enriching for us.</font>

695
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Ned.</font>

696
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe,</font>

697
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:29,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the best 4 hours of our whole trip.</font>

698
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 hours?</font>

699
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, I think this is gonna be
really fun. Seriously.</font>

700
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:39,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet now you're all happy
that I had you pack a nice outfit.</font>

701
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, because we'd much rather go
to a 4-hour opera</font>

702
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">instead of the biggest party in the world.</font>

703
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Again, don't look at me.</font>

704
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Parker, do you copy?</i></font>

705
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Comm check, 1, 2.</i></font>

706
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:55,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, here we are. Beat the rush.</font>

707
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:56,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, the rush out.</font>

708
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:00,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucky for us,
we got the best seats in the house.</font>

709
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:02,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

710
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. I'll save you a seat.</font>

711
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:16,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You look really pretty.
- And therefore, I have value?</font>

712
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's not what
I meant at all. I was just...</font>

713
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm messing with you.</font>

714
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</font>

715

- Thank you.</font>

716
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses!
- So cute.</font>

717
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I...?
- Yeah.</font>

718
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:33,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want to go in on a pair?</font>

719
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You mean, sit next to each other?
- Yeah.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Why the hell not? Parker?</i>
- you don't want to sit next to me,</font>

723
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:46,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- or, no, you just don't want the glasses?
- I didn't mean that.</font>

724
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you go ahead, I'll go grab us a pair.</font>

725
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll save you a seat next to me.</font>

729
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I gotta go. Could you just tell MJ
that I'm sick or something?</font>

730
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Be careful.</font>

731
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Peter whatever you do,</font>

732
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">please steer the monster away
from the opera house.</font>

733

Do you think she's going to the carnival?</font>

739
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, I... I don't...

I'll... I'll let you know.</font>

745
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:16,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's awesome. It's a little tight
around the old web-shooter.</font>

746
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Parker!</i>

It's a European rip-off version of him.</font>

00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Spider-Man, keep your distance.</i></font>

782
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm trying!</i></font>

783
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Can't let him get near the Ferris wheel.</i></font>

784
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Okay. I'm on it!</i></font>

785
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, what is that?!</font>

786
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Betty! Betty!</font>

787
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:20,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it! Nice! Nice! You got him!</font>

788
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.</font>

789
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too late.</font>

790
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever happens...</font>

791
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad we met.</font>

792
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beck, what are you doing?</font>

793
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I should have done last time.</font>

794
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beck, don't do it!</font>

795
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:58,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beck!</font>

796
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Beck?</font>

797
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thank God.</font>

798
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:37,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would totally kiss you,
but I think I just threw up in my mouth a little.</font>

799
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I might have a mint.</font>

800
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it's over?</font>

801
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was the last of them.</font>

802
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not the last threat we'll ever face.</font>

803
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to stay vigilant.</font>

804
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a void in this world
for someone like you.</font>

805
00:55:56,436 --> 00:56:00,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hill and I are going to Europol
headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.</font>

806
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should join us.</font>

807
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:06,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.
I just might take you up on that.</font>

808
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:19,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got gifts, Parker,
but you didn't wanna be here.</font>

809
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mr. Fury, I...
- I'd love to have you in Berlin too.</font>

810
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:28,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you got to decide
whether you're going to step up or not.</font>

811
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark chose you.</font>

812
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He made you an Avenger.</font>

813
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need that.</font>

814
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:37,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world needs that.</font>

815
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe Stark was wrong.</font>

816
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was he?</font>

817
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The choice is yours.</font>

818
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:04,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get a drink.</font>

819
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:09,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not 21.</font>

820
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:17,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

821
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta celebrate.
We did something good tonight.</font>

822
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:23,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

823
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:27,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fury was right.</font>

824
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony did a lot for me so...</font>

825
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I owe it to him, to everybody.</font>

826
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:33,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you?</font>

827
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I mean...</font>

828
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:40,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark gave me
the chance to be more.</font>

829
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wanted me to be better than him.</font>

830
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:45,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And Fury just wants me to live up to that.
- What do you want Peter?</font>

831
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you mean?
- What do you want?</font>

832
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't know.
- What do you want? You Peter Parker. Now.</font>

833
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I know you're thinking about it.
- I wanna go on my trip right.</font>

834
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to go back on my trip
with my friends.</font>

835
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:01,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower</font>

836
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:04,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the girl who I really like
and tell her how I feel and...</font>

837
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">give her a kiss.</font>

838
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up, man.</font>

839
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're not gonna do that, are you?
- No, I can't.</font>

840
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:13,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

841
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I have too much
of a responsibility.</font>

842
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:19,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh my God. Thank you so much.
- What are those?</font>

843
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are those the...?
- EDITH glasses, yeah.</font>

844
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:25,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were just on the floor? Try them on.
Let's see how they look on you.</font>

845
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:26,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah?
- Yeah.</font>

846
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I actually really like them.</font>

847
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I be completely honest with you?
- Please.</font>

848
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They look really stupid.</font>

849
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But maybe they have
a contact-lens version.</font>

850
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:41,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You try them on.</font>

851
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, come on.
- Try them on.</font>

852
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't wanna try them on.
- Just put them on.</font>

853
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think, kid?</font>

854
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."</font>

855
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."</font>

856
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:06,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

857
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark left me a message
with those glasses:</font>

858
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."</font>

859
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm still not following.
How many lemonades have you had?</font>

860
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:15,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knew every mistake I ever made OK.</font>

861
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he must've known that I was not ready
for something like this.</font>

862
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would give it to you?</font>

863
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:23,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">cause maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH,
he just trusted me to pick who should.</font>

864
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:26,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It makes so much more sense.
He knew I'd do what's right.</font>

865
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he's not gonna give them to Fury
because Fury would just give himself EDITH.</font>

866
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're probably right about that.</font>

867
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:34,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, so the world needs
the next Iron Man.</font>

868
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:37,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's not gonna me.
I mean I'm a 16-year-old kid from Queens.</font>

869
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:40,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It needs to be an adult
with some experience</font>

870
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.</font>

871
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:46,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Peter, come on. No.</font>

872
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- EDITH?
<i>- Hello, Peter.</i></font>

873
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. Yeah...</font>

874
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to transfer your control
over to Quentin Beck.</font>

875
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Peter, what are you doing?
- Doing the right thing.</font>

876
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:02,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Any transfer will require confirmation.</i>
- Stark gave you the glasses.</font>

877
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:06,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark gave me a choice. It's my choice
to make, okay? And I'm gonna make it.</font>

878
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look you're a soldier, a leader.
You stopped the Elementals.</font>

879
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:11,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saved my life.
You saved the world, okay?</font>

880
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'd want you to have them.</font>

881
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Waiting for confirmation.</i></font>

882
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:16,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Confirm.</font>

883
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to the Avengers.</font>

884
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They look good on you.</font>

885
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

886
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:35,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an honor.</font>

887
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:36,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

888
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark would've really liked you.</font>

889
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:42,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where you headed?</font>

890
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna go find MJ.
- Good luck, kid.</font>

891
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:48,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll give you a 50-50 chance.
You're pretty awkward.</font>

892
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

893
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:52,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- See you later, man.
- See you.</font>

894
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? That wasn't so hard.</font>

895
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:28,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

896
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:32,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody get
this stupid costume off me!</font>

897
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:40,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Okay, we got EDITH.</i></font>

898
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get these connected to our system.</font>

899
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Toast! Toast! Toast!</i></font>

900
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, this is a big win,
but we still got a lot of work to do.</font>

901
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Toast! Toast! Toast!</i></font>

902
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:51,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

903
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, toasts!</font>

904
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:55,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that, Doug.</font>

905
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:58,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To the man who brought us all together,
our former boss, Tony Stark.</font>

906
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The jester king.</font>

907
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:06,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Literally wrapped
in wealth and technology</font>

908
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that he was unfit to wield.</font>

909
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like the holographic system I designed.</font>

910
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A revolutionary breakthrough
with limitless applications</font>

911
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:16,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Tony turned
into a self-therapy machine</font>

912
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and renamed...</font>

913
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:20,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing,

<font face="Comic Sans MS">that my technology could change
the world.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Powerful illusions, real damage,
worked like a charm.</font>

people will believe right now.</font>

the smartest guy in the room,</font>

- What?</font>

971
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's monsters coming out
of the ground everywhere we go..</font>

972
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:05,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course our parents want us home.</font>

973
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't put me on hold.
Oh Peter, you're not dead.</font>

974
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Yes, good.
Stay here. Don't... Put some clothes on.</font>

975
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:13,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're booking flights.</font>

976

I'm live-streaming.</font>

992
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:12,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not ready for this trip to be over yet,
and I kind of want to do something fun</font>

993
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:16,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's not on the itinerary or planned
or with Mr. Harrington.</font>

994

in 10 minutes.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meet me outside in 5 minutes.</font>

999
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 5 is good.
- Okay.</font>

1000
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:31,985

- Hey.</font>

1003
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So where do you wanna go?</font>

1004
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who cares?

- Yeah, me too.</font>

1007
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To see the city a bit.</font>

1008
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:07,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They used to execute people
on this bridge.</font>

1009
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:11,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They would like put them in a basket,
and they would drown in the water.</font>

1010
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry.
- It's okay.</font>

1011
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:22,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's this thing that I've been wanting
to talk to you about</font>

1012
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for a while.</font>

1013
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:27,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>

1014
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's our last night in Europe,</font>

1015
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:34,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I had this plan
that I wanted to tell you.</font>

1016
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just gonna tell you.</font>

1017
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- MJ, I...
- "I'm Spider-Man."</font>

1018
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- That's what you were gonna say.</font>

1019
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That you're Spider-Man.</font>

1020
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:49,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I'm not Spider-Man.</font>

1021
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean I've been watching you like for a while now.</font>

1022
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:55,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's kind of obvious.</font>

1023
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:57,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not Spider-Man.</font>

1024
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would make you think
that I was Spider-Man?</font>

1025
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Peter, Washington?
- Yeah?</font>

1026
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:05,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fact that you like disappear
out of nowhere for no reason.</font>

1027
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:08,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I was sick. Remember?
I had my... The tummy?</font>

1028
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know Susan Yang thinks you're a male escort.</font>

1029
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Of course I'm not a male escort.</font>

1030
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Then you're Spider-Man.
- No, I'm not Spider-Man at all.</font>

1031
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:19,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about tonight? You snuck off,
and you fought that thing. I saw you.</font>

1032
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't have seen me
because I'm not Spider-Man.</font>

1033
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And also, on the news,
it was the Night Monkey.</font>

1034
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:25,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The Night Monkey?
- Yeah.</font>

1035
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what it said on the news,</font>

1036
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the news never lies.</font>

1037
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:34,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Night Monkey. Okay.
- What are you doing?</font>

1038
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, do the Night Monkey
and Spider-Man use the same webs?</font>

1039
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, maybe.</font>

1040
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:45,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe he's a Spider Monkey.
Who knows?</font>

1041
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:52,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Were you only watching me
because you thought I was Spider-Man?</font>

1042
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1043
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why else would I be watching you?</font>

1044
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:04,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't matter. Just thought that maybe...</font>

1045
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell was that?</font>

1046
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:14,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1047
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it, some kind of projector
or something?</font>

1048
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:32,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but it's really advanced.</font>

1049
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It... It looked so real.</font>

1050
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It...
- Yeah, really real.</font>

1051
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait, does that mean that...?
- The Elementals are fake?</font>

1052
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:44,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't make any sense
because we were there, right?</font>

1053
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:47,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was fire and destruction, and...</font>

1054
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:50,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who would do something like that?</font>

1055
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:01,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mysterio.</font>

1056
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Spider-Man.</font>

1057
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:12,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And I've really messed up.
- Wait. You're being serious right now?</font>

1058
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:16,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not joking with me. You're like 100 percent serious?
Because it's not funny.</font>

1059
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm not joking.</font>

1060
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I was...
I was only like 67 percent sure.</font>

1061
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:21,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- MJ...
- So why are you here?</font>

1062
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:24,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why are you on this school trip?
- I know you have a lot of questions,</font>

1063
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:26,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but look we have to get out of here, okay?</font>

1064
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:29,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Okay. I can't believe I figured it out!</font>

1065
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You took everything from me!</font>

1066
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:36,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is for my family!</font>

1067
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:43,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pause.</font>

1068
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:46,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pause.</font>

1069
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:49,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

1070
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:52,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, can you just fast-forward
to the end?</font>

1071
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep. Stand by.</font>

1072
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, fly, fly, fly, zap, zap, zap.</font>

1073
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:04,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pause. I'm not in love
with this choreography, but it'll do.</font>

1074
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:05,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill image.</font>

1075
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">De-cloak drones.</font>

1076
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:10,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, weapons.</font>

1077
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You want to weaponize?
- Yep.</font>

1078
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weapons only. Stand by.</font>

1079
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nice.
- Stop.</font>

1080
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something. I don't know what it is.
It's something...</font>

1081
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:33,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just dou... You know what?
Double the damage and then run it again.</font>

1082
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me to double it up?</font>

1083
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- All right.</font>

1084
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover your ears.</font>

1085
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is good! That's good.</font>

1086
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We on schedule?
- Oh, yeah.</font>

1087
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:54,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uploading software hack
to EDITH network.</font>

1088
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:58,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With her drones, we'll be able to create an event
big enough to cover an entire city.</font>

1089
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, well done.</font>

1090
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure every drone is weapons-hot.
We need maximum damage.</font>

1091
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That is gonna cause a lot of casualties.
- Oh, yeah.</font>

1092
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:07,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More casualties, more coverage.
I gotta cut through the static.</font>

1093
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:10,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">London is a beautiful city,
and it will suffer, but they can rebuild.</font>

1094
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I'm the next Iron Man,</font>

1095
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:15,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to save the world
from an Avengers-level threat.</font>

1096
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But when its new savior descends,</font>

1097
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all those casualties will be forgotten.</font>

1098
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:26,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janice, you'll be in position with my
quick-change armor for the victory lap?</font>

1099
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course. Do you wanna try...?</font>

1100
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:29,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, that's...
What's going on with my hand?</font>

1101
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:31,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is that happening?</font>

1102
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:34,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, one of the drones that came back
from the plaza was missing a projector.</font>

1103
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fine.</font>

1104
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, and you're...?
You're telling me this now?</font>

1105
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's... It's one drone.</font>

1106
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:44,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The image will be perfect, I promise.
- That projector is evidence.</font>

1107
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:47,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's going to tell people what we're doing
and how we're doing it.</font>

1108
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:51,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am trying to fool 7 billion people here,
including Nick Fury,</font>

1109
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:54,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who happens to be the most paranoid
and most dangerous person on the planet.</font>

1110
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:57,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he catches on before I've killed him,
and he will put a bullet in my head.</font>

1111
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:00,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And nobody wants a bullet
in their head, right?</font>

1112
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:03,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>

1113
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">William, can you look at me?</font>

1114
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull up EDITH.</font>

1115
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hello, Quentin.</i></font>

1116
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:18,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, honey. I need a level-5 search,
full-resource protocol for this device.</font>

1117
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Magnifying.</i></font>

1118
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There. Search everything going in
and out of that building.</font>

1119
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Located.</i></font>

1120
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:27,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

1121
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, William, one day,</font>

1122
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after I've had to kill Peter Parker
because of this,</font>

1123
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:39,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you remember
that his blood is on your hands!</font>

1124
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:46,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses.
How could I be that stupid?</font>

1125
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:50,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's probably spying on me right now
or sending a drone to come and kill me.</font>

1126
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had access to killer drones?</font>

1127
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:56,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I didn't really want them,
especially after I almost killed Brad.</font>

1128
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:58,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You almost killed Brad?</font>

1129
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:02,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I have to call Mr. Fury
and tell him that Beck's a fraud...</font>

1130
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:05,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- but I think he tapped my phone.
- Ok so, what are you gonna do?</font>

1131
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:08,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need my suit, and I have to go to Berlin</font>

1132
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and talk to Mr. Fury in person.</font>

1133
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:15,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just...</font>

1134
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:36,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Ned, perfect.</font>

1135
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:38,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The costume looks great...</font>

1136
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:43,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the costume party
at the prince's castle.</font>

1137
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She knows. I told her.</font>

1138
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't tell me. I figured it out.</font>

1139
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:52,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's cool.
- Like, a long time ago.</font>

1140
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:58,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look, Mysterio is a fraud.
- But he saved me and Betty's lives.</font>

1141
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. He's been faking the whole thing
with illusion tech.</font>

1142
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:03,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he's using these, like,
hologram projectors.</font>

1143
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's crazy.</font>

1144
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1145
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:12,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you guys were like working
the case together or what?</font>

1146
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:13,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been mostly me.</font>

1147
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look Ned, I need you to call May,
get her to call Mr. Harrington,</font>

1148
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">say she wanted me to stay
with family in Berlin until this is over, okay?</font>

1149
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:20,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it. Easy.</font>

1150
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:23,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, you guys lie with such ease.</font>

1151
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I gotta go.
- Wait, wait, wait. The projector.</font>

1152
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna need this.</font>

1153
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't tell anyone about this, okay?
Anyone who knows is in danger.</font>

1154
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:42,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you know too.</font>

1155
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:44,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's cool.</font>

1156
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:47,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've known first, and I've known longer,
but it's not a competition.</font>

1157
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:11,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me. Do you know where...?
<i>- Nacht</i> Monkey!</font>

1158
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:13,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, wait, I didn't... Oh, man.</font>

1159
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:17,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in.</font>

1160
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:27,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mr. Fury...
- You've got a lot of explaining to do.</font>

1161
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, no, no, listen.
- Wait until we're secure.</font>

1162
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:31,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1163
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:37,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

1164
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:07,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So is there anything you want
to tell us about your girlfriend?</font>

1165
01:17:07,498 --> 01:17:08,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's talking about EDITH.</font>

1166
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:12,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look I know I made a mistake, and I'm sorry,
but he is not who you think he is.</font>

1167
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:15,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beck is a liar.
Mysterio, the Elementals, it's all fake.</font>

1168
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:16,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has some sort of illusion tech.</font>

1169
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how he tricked you
and tricked me into giving him EDITH.</font>

1170
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:23,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a projector. I pulled it off
the fire monster in Prague.</font>

1171
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:27,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So all that death
and destruction we witnessed</font>

01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not just this.
I think he's using drones.</font>

1174
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:36,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if this is true, then Beck's
very dangerous and we need to be smart.</font>

1175
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who else did you tell about this?</font>

1176
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Parker? Parker!</font>

1177
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's wrong?
- It's Beck. He's here.</font>

1178
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Hill?</font>

1179
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's just an illu...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fury!</font>

1182
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I thought we were close.</i></font>

01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:08,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Fury always had to die, but not you.</i></font>

1184
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop hiding, Beck!</font>

1185
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:14,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I tried to help you walk away.</i></font>

1186
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Now you're making me do this.</i></font>

1187
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:24,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You told me, you were just a kid.</i></font>

1188
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:28,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You told me, you wanted
to run after that girl.</i></font>

1189
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Help me!
- MJ!</font>

1190
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:32,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God!</font>

1191
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:38,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Peter, what's going on?
- I know this isn't real.</font>

1192
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:39,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Do you, though?</i></font>

1193
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:43,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MJ! MJ!</font>

1194
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:49,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I don't think you know what's real, Peter.</i></font>

1195

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You need to wake up!</i></font>

1196
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:29,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I mean, look at yourself.</i></font>

1197
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:43,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You are just a scared little kid
in a sweat suit.</i></font>

1198
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:49,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I created Mysterio to give the world
someone to believe in.</i></font>

01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I control the truth.</i></font>

maybe Tony would still be alive.</i></font>

01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Deep down, you know I'm right.</i></font>

1203
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:53,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You made your choice.
And all you had to do was step aside.</i></font>

1204
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:57,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And now you have...</i></font>

1205
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:10,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fury.</font>

1206
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:15,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beck's people are trying to find
everyone who could expose him.</font>

1207
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:17,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who'd you tell?</font>

1208
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:20,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you told someone, so just tell me.</font>

1209
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Who did you tell?</font>

1210
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:25,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who else did you tell?!
- Just Ned and MJ from my class.</font>

1211
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty,
but that's it.</font>

1212
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1213
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:33,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are so gullible.</font>

1214
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- You're smart as a whip.</font>

1215
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:36,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a...</font>

1216
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sucker.</font>

1217
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:42,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And now all your friends have to die.
- Oh, my God.</font>

1218
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:50,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's easy to fool people
when they're already fooling themselves.</font>

1219
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:57,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But for what it's worth, Peter,</font>

1220
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:00,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really am sorry.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Access files to Peter Parker's class trip.</font>

1223
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:16,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need them to fly home from London.</font>

1224
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:57,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1225
01:22:58,474 --> 01:22:59,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where am I?</font>

1226
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:01,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Municipal holding facility.</font>

1227
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They said they found you unconscious
at the train yard. Very dangerous.</font>

1228
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:09,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we gave you the shirt
because you seemed a bit cold.</font>

1229
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:10,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

1230
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:13,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys are nice.</font>

1231
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You speak really good English.</font>

1232
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:18,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to the Netherlands.</font>

1233
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm in the Netherlands right now?
- Yep.</font>

1234
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>

1235
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:26,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guard!</font>

1236
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:29,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The guard is on a break.
Probably talking to his wife.</font>

1237
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:31,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, she's pregnant.
- Oh, yeah?</font>

1238
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:32,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1239
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:41,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1240
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:43,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1241
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Night Monkey. Yeah.</font>

1242
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:51,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys okay?</font>

1243
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?</font>

1244
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:08,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Could I borrow your phone?
- Yeah.</font>

1245
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:11,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone is so nice here.</font>

1246
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:13,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1247
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:19,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1248
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, hey...</font>

1249
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I messed up. I need a... I need a ride.</font>

1250
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where am I? Where am I, sir?</font>

1251
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:33,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Broek op Langedijk.</font>

1252
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:37,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on. Could you say that into there?</font>

1253
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:40,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. It's Broek op Langedijk here.</font>

1254
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:43,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, no problem.</font>

1255
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:45,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

1256
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:46,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you get that?</font>

1257
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:10,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter? Are you okay?</font>

1258
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Happy, is that you?
- Is it me? Yeah, of course it's me.</font>

1259
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:17,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop! Tell me something
only you would know.</font>

1260
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only I would know...</font>

1261
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember when we went to Germany?</font>

1262
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:23,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You pay-per-viewed a video
in your room?</font>

1263
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:27,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They didn't list the titles, but I could tell
by the price it was an adult film on the front desk.</font>

1264
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:30,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And you didn't know how I knew...
- Okay, fine! It's you. Stop.</font>

1265
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so good to see you.</font>

1266
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:38,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter you'll have to tell me
what the hell is going on here.</font>

1267
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, hold still.</font>

1268
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:42,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There we go.</font>

1269
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:50,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ouch.</font>

1270
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:53,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I thought you had super strength.
- It still hurts.</font>

1271
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:58,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Happy, come on.
- All right, relax.</font>

1272
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:02,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just a few more. There we go.
- Oh, my God, Happy.</font>

1273
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:03,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Relax.
- Don't tell me to relax, Happy!</font>

1274
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I relax
when I messed up so bad?</font>

1275
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:09,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I trusted Beck. Right?</font>

1276
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:13,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought he was my friend. So I gave him
the only thing Mr. Stark left behind for me,</font>

1277
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:15,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now he's gonna kill my friends
and half of Europe,</font>

1278
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:18,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so please do not tell me to relax.</font>

1279
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:23,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't shout.</font>

1280
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:27,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just really miss him.</font>

1281
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:30,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I miss him too.</font>

1282
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:34,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everywhere I go...</font>

1283
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:37,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see his face.</font>

1284
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:42,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the whole world is asking
who's gonna be the next Iron Man...</font>

1285
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:48,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I don't know if that's me, Happy.
I'm not Iron Man.</font>

1286
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:51,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not Iron Man.</font>

1287
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're never gonna be Iron Man.</font>

1288
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody could live up to Tony.</font>

1289
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:00,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not even Tony.</font>

1290
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony was my best friend.</font>

1291
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:04,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he was a mess.</font>

1292
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:08,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He second-guessed everything he did.
He was all over the place.</font>

1293
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:12,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The one thing that he did that he didn't
second-guess was picking you.</font>

1294
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:17,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
Tony would have done what he did</font>

1295
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:20,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if he didn't know that you were
gonna be here after he was gone.</font>

1296
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:27,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, your friends are in trouble,
you're all alone, your tech is missing.</font>

1297
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:30,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you gonna do about it?</font>

1298
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:37,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna kick his ass.</font>

1299
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:40,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I mean, right now.
Like specifically, what are we gonna do?</font>

1300
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:43,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we've been hovering over
a tulip field for the last 15 minutes.</font>

1301
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:46,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. I can't call my friends
because he's tracking their phones.</font>

I'll take care of the music.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters?</font>

1320
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:15,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isolate the Taser webs,
and reconfigure and boost the voltage</font>

1321
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:19,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to a factor of 25 percent,</font>

1322
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:21,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and give me complete manual control
over detonation.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay guys, the company set up a city tour,</font>

1328
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:41,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then we'll grab a bite
and head to the airport.</font>

1329
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:45,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is no one else going
to acknowledge how crazy this is?</font>

1330

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, I get it.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has no one else noticed how shady he is?</font>

1334
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:56,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I saw him in the back room
of a rest stop with some woman</font>

1335
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:59,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in his underwear,
and he's always sneaking away,</font>

1336

<font face="Comic Sans MS">like back at the opera, huh?</font>

1337
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:04,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now he's suddenly off the trip,
with his family in Berlin?</font>

1338
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:07,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is no one else interested in the truth?</font>

1339
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:12,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The very concept of objective truth
is fading out of the world."</font>

- Yeah.</font>

1342
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:19,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I mean since Peter's not really here
to tell his truth, what about you, Brad?</font>

1343
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:21,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think its cool take
pictures of people in the bathroom?</font>

1344
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:23,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, what's that about?</font>

1345
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:26,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It was...</font>

said the class.</font>

1349
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:36,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1350

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna be a cool teacher right now.</font>

1351
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:42,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta stop doing that OK. It is weird.</font>

1352
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:46,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more photos in the bathroom.
Urinal or stalls.</font>

1353
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:47,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay?
- Look at this, guys.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Harrington, come on this is your bus.</font>

1355
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:52,820

- Nice to see you all. Come along.</font>

1356
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:54,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll get this, yeah? Why not?
- Thank you.</font>

1357
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:56,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Thank you, brother.</font>

1358
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:58,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1359
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:00,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have the kids.</font>

1360
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:06,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got here as fast as I could.</font>

1361
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:09,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing.</font>

1362
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:10,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it.</font>

1368
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, people, no Avengers coming.
Good to go.</font>

1428
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:08,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, that is an Avengers-level threat.</font>

1429
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:26,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way. This way!</font>

1430
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:28,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, my God!</font>

1431
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:30,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Flash!
- Follow that cursed hand.</font>

1432
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:31,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way, kids. Follow me.</font>

1433
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:35,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's not real, it's not real!
- It looks pretty real to me!</font>

1434
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:36,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me, kids!</font>

1435
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:38,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Earth, wind, fire, water.</font>

1436
01:35:38,775 --> 01:35:41,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. They joined forces
like the Power Rangers.</font>

1437
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're thinking of Voltron.
- Who?</font>

1438
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Voltron! You're thinking of Voltron!</font>

1439
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:47,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, look, it's Mysterio!</font>

1440
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:48,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gonna save us!</font>

1441
01:35:52,121 --> 01:35:53,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Mysterio knows we know...</font>

1442
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Then we're in danger.
- Yeah, and so are they.</font>

1443
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:57,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should go.</font>

1444
01:35:58,836 --> 01:35:59,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill that witch!</font>

1445
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:04,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is for my family!</font>

1446
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get somewhere safe, Fury.</font>

1447
01:36:07,887 --> 01:36:09,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I don't see this ending well.</i></font>

1448
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:13,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I appreciate your concern,
but I never leave my men behind.</font>

1449
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, comms check.
Can you hear me, kid?</font>

1450
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:20,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah I can. It's a little loud out here.
- I like the new suit.</font>

1451
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:23,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks.
- Whoa, Peter, you sure that's not real?</font>

1452
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:25,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger
than I expected.</font>

1453
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:27,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still the play?</font>

1454
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:29,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to get high enough
so Beck doesn't see me coming.</font>

1455
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:31,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Copy. Stay sticky.</font>

1456
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Happy.
- Yeah, kid. What is it?</font>

1457
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:40,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to have a serious conversation
about you and my aunt!</font>

1458
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beck, report!</font>

1459
01:36:56,686 --> 01:36:59,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guterman, I need a response.
Something quick and decisive.</font>

1460
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:02,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"It's all the Elementals.
They're somehow merged into something..."</font>

1461
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...into something else.
Something more powerful.</font>

1462
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:06,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's drawing energy from the Earth's core.</font>

1463
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:13,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, now, that's some bullshit.</font>

1464
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:17,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that...?</font>

1465
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:24,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be ready for anything.</font>

1466
01:37:24,172 --> 01:37:25,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1467
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:33,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not real, it's not real, it's not real!</font>

1468
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:41,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's awesome.</font>

1469
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:09,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">William, I've got drones
breaking formation.</font>

1470
01:38:09,425 --> 01:38:11,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe they hit a flock of birds or something.
You're fine.</font>

1471
01:38:11,844 --> 01:38:13,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna see what's happening now
Taking manual control.</font>

1472
01:38:20,645 --> 01:38:22,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Do you see anything?</i></font>

1473
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:25,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. And I'm gonna kill him.</font>

1474
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:32,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope this works.</font>

1475
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:49,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got me?</font>

1476
01:38:54,637 --> 01:38:55,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you.</font>

1477
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:57,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Boss, the illusion is coming apart.</i></font>

1478

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see you.</font>

1479
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:08,769

- No. I'm not gonna kill it. They'll see.</font>

1481
01:39:26,419 --> 01:39:28,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll see what I want them to see!</font>

1482
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:31,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you still need the cape?
- Yes, Janice.</font>

1483
01:39:32,008 --> 01:39:34,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I still need the cape.
- Done.</font>

1484
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:39,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now William, render my illusion suit.
- All right, hang on.</font>

1485
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:41,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The monster was full of drones!
It's crazy!</i></font>

1486

1487
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:47,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy.</font>

1488

1489
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:56,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ned!

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta get you guys out of here!
Get on the jet!</font>

1491
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:00,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who are you?
- I work with Spider-Man, okay?</font>

1492
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:02,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You gotta get on that jet.
- You work for Spider-Man?</font>

1493

not for Spider-Man.</font>

1494
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:10,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- New plan. Into the Tower.

1495
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:13,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Happy, are you okay?

1561
01:47:58,263 --> 01:47:59,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a halberd.</font>

1562
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:05,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1563

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How could you do all of this?
- You'll see, Peter.</font>

1564
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:17,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People, they need to believe.</font>

1565
01:48:19,368 --> 01:48:20,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And nowadays...</font>

1566

<font face="Comic Sans MS">they'll believe anything.</font>

1567

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he...?</font>

1568
01:48:38,429 --> 01:48:39,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this real?</font>

1570
01:48:58,657 --> 01:48:59,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

1571
01:48:59,742 --> 01:49:01,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where you going?</font>

1572
01:49:09,043 --> 01:49:10,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- MJ.
- Hey.</font>

1573
01:49:11,336 --> 01:49:12,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- Hey.</font>

- I'm okay. Are you okay?</font>

1575
01:49:14,173 --> 01:49:16,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. Yeah.
- Is everybody else okay?</font>

1576
01:49:16,675 --> 01:49:18,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, everyone's okay.</font>

1577
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:22,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What happened?
- There was just the drones,</font>

1578
01:49:22,222 --> 01:49:24,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they were following us,
and then they just stopped.</font>

1579
01:49:26,727 --> 01:49:28,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Was that you?
- Yeah.</font>

1580
01:49:29,688 --> 01:49:30,688

1581
01:49:33,942 --> 01:49:35,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Well, I...</font>

1582
01:49:37,071 --> 01:49:38,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">brought that.</font>

1583
01:49:39,073 --> 01:49:40,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In case you needed some help.</font>

1584
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:42,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

1585
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:49,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, there was this sweaty guy
in the tower with us.</font>

1586
01:49:49,124 --> 01:49:51,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think he works for you or something.</font>

1587
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:53,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He...</font>

1588
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:55,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He gave me this.
- No.</font>

1589
01:49:55,881 --> 01:49:56,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1590
01:49:58,175 --> 01:49:59,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, MJ, I'm so sorry.</font>

1591
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I had this stupid plan.
- Peter.</font>

1592
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:05,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wrote it down, I was gonna buy you this
and give it to you in Paris at the top...</font>

1593
01:50:09,394 --> 01:50:10,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you kissed me.</font>

1594
01:50:10,813 --> 01:50:13,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What? What?
- Yeah.</font>

1595
01:50:13,482 --> 01:50:17,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't really have much luck
when it comes to getting close to people.</font>

1596
01:50:19,988 --> 01:50:21,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I lied.</font>

1597
01:50:23,117 --> 01:50:27,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't just watching you
because I thought you were Spider-Man.</font>

1598
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:33,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's great.</font>

1599
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:37,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Black dahlia, like the murder.
- The murder.</font>

1600
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:39,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good.
- Yeah.</font>

1601
01:50:39,258 --> 01:50:40,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry it's broken.</font>

1602
01:50:40,968 --> 01:50:43,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I actually like it better broken.</font>

1603
01:50:45,013 --> 01:50:46,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really like you.</font>

1604
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:49,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really like you too.</font>

1605
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:05,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I should...</font>

1606
01:51:05,576 --> 01:51:08,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should probably get back to the class.</font>

1607
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:09,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll go and...</font>

1608
01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:12,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. I don't know.
- Okay.</font>

1609
01:51:14,835 --> 01:51:15,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just in case.</font>

1610
01:51:23,969 --> 01:51:25,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, no.</font>

1611
01:51:25,512 --> 01:51:28,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, May, you're right.
He did great. He was strong.</font>

1612
01:51:28,849 --> 01:51:30,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I'm glad he stayed too.</font>

1613
01:51:31,018 --> 01:51:32,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta go.</font>

1614
01:51:33,896 --> 01:51:36,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad you're alive.
I guess the coded message worked.</font>

1615
01:51:36,899 --> 01:51:39,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Appearances can be deceiving."</font>

1616
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:41,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm surprised you didn't
just wink in the camera.</font>

1617
01:51:41,945 --> 01:51:42,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It worked.</font>

1618
01:51:43,071 --> 01:51:45,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only because I had serious doubts
about Beck from the beginning.</font>

1619
01:51:45,908 --> 01:51:47,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not true. He had zero doubts.</font>

1620
01:51:51,163 --> 01:51:52,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Parker?</font>

1621
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:53,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's with a girl.</font>

1622
01:51:53,665 --> 01:51:56,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to speak with him.</font>

1623
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:58,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He'll call you.
- He'll...?</font>

1624
01:52:03,217 --> 01:52:05,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Great.</font>

1625
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:07,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he better.</font>

1626
01:52:07,221 --> 01:52:09,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or it's your ass.</font>

1627
01:52:09,765 --> 01:52:12,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And don't even think about ghosting me.</font>

1628
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:31,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure
no one else has figured it out?</font>

1629
01:52:31,912 --> 01:52:35,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's not like anybody
really pays attention to you.</font>

1630
01:52:35,874 --> 01:52:36,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ouch.</font>

1631
01:52:37,251 --> 01:52:38,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except for me.</font>

1632
01:52:39,044 --> 01:52:39,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

1633
01:52:40,045 --> 01:52:41,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't be late.
- I won't.</font>

1634
01:52:41,838 --> 01:52:42,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you later.</font>

1635
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:45,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You guys are so cute.
- Thanks.</font>

1636
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:50,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was thinking maybe we should all
go.. I don't know.. on a double date or something.</font>

1637
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:53,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, we broke up.
- Oh, we broke up.</font>

1638
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:54,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. What? Why?</font>

1639
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:57,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Men and women grow apart,</font>

1640
01:52:57,479 --> 01:53:00,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the journey they share together
will always be a part of them.</font>

1641
01:53:02,234 --> 01:53:04,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You are so wise.
- Thank you.</font>

1642
01:53:07,572 --> 01:53:08,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Gerald.</font>

1643
01:53:09,908 --> 01:53:11,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could Mother not make it?</font>

1644
01:53:17,916 --> 01:53:19,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- May!
- I promise you...</font>

1645
01:53:19,251 --> 01:53:21,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, he's here. Don't give me a ticket.</font>

1646
01:53:24,006 --> 01:53:25,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so glad you're okay.</font>

1647
01:53:26,008 --> 01:53:28,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, for real, I'm good.
I'm actually really fine.</font>

1648
01:53:29,052 --> 01:53:30,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go. Where are your bags?</font>

1649
01:53:31,013 --> 01:53:33,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, right. They got blown up.
- Yeah.</font>

1650
01:53:34,224 --> 01:53:36,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got you some hot buttered bagels.
- Thank you so much.</font>

1651
01:53:36,643 --> 01:53:37,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know my boy.</font>

1652
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:41,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I kept my identity pretty guarded
this past couple years.</i></font>

1653
01:53:41,106 --> 01:53:42,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I faced a lot of deception.</i></font>

1654
01:53:42,899 --> 01:53:45,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I'm tired of the lies.</i></font>

1655
01:53:45,861 --> 01:53:48,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it's time for the truth to be out there.</font>

1656
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:52,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you dating?</font>

1657
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:54,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Not really.</font>

1658
01:53:55,454 --> 01:53:57,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Well...</font>

1659
01:53:57,331 --> 01:53:59,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I think...
- Summer fling.</font>

1660
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:01,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that evolves
and grows like any other.</font>

1661
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:04,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I still don't know where it's going to go.
- Open to wherever it might lead.</font>

1662
01:54:04,713 --> 01:54:06,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Anywhere. On or off.
- To share it with people...</font>

1663
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:10,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We'll always be friends, no matter what.
- I'm gonna go because I've got a date.</font>

1664
01:54:10,844 --> 01:54:13,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...because we all are interconnected.</font>

1665
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:14,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye.
- We are.</font>

1666
01:54:33,283 --> 01:54:34,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry!</font>

1667
01:55:11,238 --> 01:55:12,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.</font>

1668
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's fine.
- You ready?</font>

1669
01:55:15,283 --> 01:55:16,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- You're gonna love this.</font>

1670
01:55:17,035 --> 01:55:18,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay! Okay!</font>

1671
01:55:18,995 --> 01:55:20,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay. Okay.
- You ready?</font>

1672
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:24,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I'm just not gonna watch.
I'm not gonna watch.</font>

1673
01:55:26,128 --> 01:55:28,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should stop looking.
I'm gonna stop looking!</font>

1674
01:57:45,433 --> 01:57:47,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. You can put me down now!
You can put me down now!</font>

1675
01:57:50,063 --> 01:57:51,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

1676
01:57:55,026 --> 01:57:57,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.</font>

1677
01:57:57,112 --> 01:57:59,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just... Never, never doing that again.</font>

1678
01:57:59,739 --> 01:58:01,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm never doing that again.
- Okay.</font>

1679
01:58:02,033 --> 01:58:03,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should probably get out of here.</font>

1680
01:58:03,326 --> 01:58:04,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Be safe.
- See you later.</font>
