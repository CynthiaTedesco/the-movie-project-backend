1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,380
If I feel that I could be certain then

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,100
I would say the things, I want to say, to--

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,460

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,160
Go! Go! Go!

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,940

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,620
Sorry dad

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,620
My theater has been going through some pretty rough times, lately..!

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,940
So.. What do I do?

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,440
Quit?

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,100
No!

12
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,620

00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,320

22

Oh yeah, you're great honey

23
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,180
By the way, the bathroom sink is blocked again.

24
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,500
Im here to win...

25
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,000

26
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,540

Oh yes, I'm fine, thank you

42
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,540
How are you?

43
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,200

Wow!

47
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,940
This show is not gonna save your theater!

48
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,840
Maybe it's time to just.. move on

49
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,440
Come on! You know how much this means to us!

50
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,720
You can't just sing it!

51
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,240
You've got to show the fire on desire!

52
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,380
The fire went out a long time ago...

53
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,540
You are not going to believe what I did today!

54
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,040
*snoring*

55
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,320
*I am lost..*

56
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,720
*I am vain*

57
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,220
Dad, I just don't wanna be in your gang...

58
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,500
I wanna be a singer...

59
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,700
How did I end up with a son like you...

60
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,840
I'll get you out! Dad! Wait! I'll get the money! I promise!

61
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,240
I could really use some extra piano lessons

62
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,960
Yes... that was.. very bad

63
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,900
A defying moment in all of our lives!

64
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,060
We're going to be spicy, no?

65
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,940
Ya!

66
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,440
Yeah! Woohoo!

67
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,960
Don't let fear stop you from doing the thing you love

68
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,860
*cheering*

69
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,720
You know what's great about hitting rock bottom?

70
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,060
There's only one way left to go!

71
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,140
And that's.. up!

72
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,520
This store will close in 15 minutes

73
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,240
*yawning*

74
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:52,000
*upbeat music*

75
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,460
The lady in aisle 6...

76
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,800
That... was awesome

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,880
*cheering and clapping*

78
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,520
Sing!

79
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,420
Sing!
