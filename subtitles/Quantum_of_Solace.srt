1
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,790
It's time to get out.

2
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,750
Don't bleed
to death.

3
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,591
Hello, Mitchell.
Bond.

4
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,218
The Americans are gonna be
none too pleased about this.

5
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,721
I promised them Le Chiffre,
and they got Le Chiffre.

6
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,264
They got his body.

7
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,017
If they'd wanted his soul, they should
have made a deal with a priest.

8
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,603
Has he said
anything?

9
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,854
No.

10
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,481
I'm going to check
the perimeter, ma'am.

11
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,485
You look like hell.

12
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,986
When's the last
time you slept?

13
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,450
Vesper's boyfriend, Yusef Kabira, the
one who was abducted in Morocco,

14
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,160
the one she was
trying to save.

15
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,579
His body was washed up
on a beach in lbiza.

16
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,332
We're meant to believe
the fish did that to his face.

17
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,209
His wallet and ID
were in his pocket.

18
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,002
Well, that's convenient.
Quite.

19
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,670
Which is why I did
a DNA check

20
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,298
on a lock of his hair found
in Vesper's apartment.

21
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,466
It's not him.

22
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,218
A lock of his hair?

23
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,094
I wouldn't have thought
Vesper the sentimental type.

24
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,431
Well, we never really
know anyone, do we?

25
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,644
But I do need
to know, Bond.

26
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,605
I need to know
that I can trust you.

27
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,524
And you don't?

28
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,025
Well, it'd be
a pretty cold bastard

29
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,986
who didn't want revenge for the
death of someone he loved.

30
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,155
You don't have
to worry about me.

31
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,492
I'm not gonna go chasing him.
He's not important.

32
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,496
And neither was she.

33
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,790
It's clear, ma'am.

34
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,167
Thanks, Mitchell.
Shall we?

35
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,938
Are you gonna tell us
who you work for?

36
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,441
I was always very
interested to meet you.

37
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,736
I'd heard so much about
you from Vesper.

38
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,906
The real shame is that
if she hadn't killed herself,

39
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,908
we would have had you, too.

40
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,370
I think you would have
done anything for her.

41
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,915
Well, you know you're not in Britain,
and God knows where you'll be tomorrow.

42
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,417
Which should tell
you that eventually

43
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,670
you will tell us about
the people you work with,

44
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,256
and the longer it takes, the
more painful we'll make it.

45
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,554
You really don't
know anything about us.

46
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,102
It's so amusing because
we are on the other side,

47
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,939
thinking, "The MI6, the CIA, they're
looking over our shoulders.

48
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,816
"They're listening
to our conversations."

49
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,069
And the truth is you don't
even know we exist.

50
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,905
Well, we do now, Mr. White,
and we're quick learners.

51
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,954
Oh, really? Well, then, the
first thing you should know about us

52
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,540
is that we have
people everywhere.

53
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,042
Am I right?

54
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,691
Anything?

55
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,195
Craig Mitchell worked
for me for eight years.

56
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,740
He passed a full security check
and lie detector test every year.

57
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,451
Didn't leave so much as a scrap
of paper to explain any of it.

58
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,496
Eight years! Five as
my personal bodyguard.

59
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,915
I found this and three other
bloody Christmas presents

60
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,208
I bought him
about the house.

61
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,793
I don't think he smoked.

62
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,795
And you had
to kill him.

63
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,131
Couldn't bring him in for questioning so
that we might actually learn something.

64
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,385
When someone says we got people everywhere,
you expect it to be hyperbole.

65
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,471
Lots of people say that.
Florists use that expression.

66
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:17,392
Doesn't mean that they've got somebody
working for them inside the bloody room.

67
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,686
What the hell is
this organization, Bond?

68
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,230
How can they be everywhere and
we know nothing about them?

69
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,402
I assume we found no
trace of White. No.

70
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,070
The agent guarding the door
in the garage was dead

71
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,738
before you passed him
on the stairs.

72
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,615
I passed him on the stairs?
Christ!

73
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,576
Mitchell must have killed him when
he went out to check the perimeter.

74
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,328
You're lucky to be here.

75
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,997
Do you
think White's still alive?

76
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,873
Yes, I do.
What is it?

77
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,834
Craig Mitchell,
45 years old.

78
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,336
No living family. Gave
generously to charity.

79
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,171
Tell me you know
more than that.

80
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,841
Our moneymen went through every bill
in Mitchell's wallet and house.

81
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,175
How much did he have?

82
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,969
Less than 100 pounds,

83
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,013
and about the same
in euros and dollars.

84
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,597
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am.

85
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,057
We've done a complete
forensic analysis

86
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,976
of every note and
its traceable history.

87
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,769
Not in the mood.

88
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,856
After you.

89
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,650
This particular note from
Mitchell's wallet may be of interest.

90
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,693
Scanning.

91
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,863
We introduced tagged bills into Le
Chiffre's money-laundering operation

92
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,115
by intercepting
illegal payoffs.

93
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,201
We traced money through several of
his bank accounts around the world.

94
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,829
That's pretty thin. At the
rate money changes hands,

95
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,789
you could probably find a
tenner in my wallet with a tag.

96
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,208
That's true, ma'am. A single
bill could be a coincidence,

97
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,543
but what about
a whole stack?

98
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,379
These bills, from the same
series as Mitchell's,

99
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,466
were just scanned at a bank
in Port-au-Prince, Haiti,

100
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,469
deposited in the account
of a Mr. Slate.

101
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,137
Impress me.

102
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:40,516
We have a Mr. Edmund Slate returning to
Port-au-Prince from Heathrow this morning.

103
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,353
His entry documents have him
staying at the Hotel Dessalines.

104
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,314
He's in room 325.

105
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,992
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

106
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,623
Do you have any
messages for 325?

107
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,960
No, sir. The only message
was about the briefcase

108
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,545
that was delivered
earlier.

109
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,047
Did you want us
to continue holding it?

110
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,423
No. No,
I'll take that now.

111
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,841
Yes, sir.

112
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,846
Thank you.
You're welcome.

113
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,689
Get in!

114
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,316
What?

115
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Get in.

116
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,987
All right.

117
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,700
You're late.

118
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,160
I got pulled
into a meeting.

119
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,329
Who with?

120
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,498
A friend of Mr. White's.

121
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,166
Don't think
I know him.

122
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,256
It's funny.

123
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,341
You don't look at all
like I expected.

124
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,593
Really? What were
you expecting?

125
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,387
I didn't think
geologists looked so...

126
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,430
So?

127
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,185
A friend of yours?

128
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,354
I don't have any friends.

129
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,196
Get out of
the way! Move!

130
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,961
We didn't settle
on a price.

131
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,129
Make me an offer.

132
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,966
We can work it out
later, over drinks.

133
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,722
Dominic didn't give you
any trouble, did he?

134
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,056
No.

135
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,021
What the hell is this?

136
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,689
I think someone
wants to kill you.

137
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,115
That wasn't very nice.

138
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,786
You were supposed
to shoot her.

139
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,413
Well, I missed.

140
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,467
Get Bond.

141
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,178
Where is he now?

142
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,096
Approaching the docks,
Kings Quay.

143
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,060
- Connecting.
- Tanner.

144
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,145
I've got Bond.
Ask him about Slate.

145
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,855
She wants to know
about Slate.

146
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,106
Tell her Slate
was a dead end.

147
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,983
Slate was a dead end.

148
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,318
Connection terminated.

149
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,111
Damn him.
He killed him.

150
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,894
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

151
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,146
Touch me and I'll
break your wrist.

152
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,784
Camille.

153
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,662
How nice to see you.

154
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,872
Alive, you mean?

155
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,167
I knew we shouldn't
have slept together.

156
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,212
I think I'm starting
to like you.

157
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,714
So you did just try
and have me killed.

158
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,301
And that made me
very sad

159
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,512
thinking I would never
see you again.

160
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,140
But here you are.

161
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,101
Damn it, Dominic!
I was trying to help you.

162
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,064
I was trying to
uncover a leak.

163
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,276
And you, you sent
someone to kill me?

164
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,237
Please don't talk to me
like I'm stupid!

165
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,532
It's unattractive.

166
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,620
Come. I wanna
show you something.

167
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,874
Come.

168
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,626
There's nothing that makes
me more uncomfortable

169
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,129
than friends talking
behind my back.

170
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,881
It feels like

171
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,175
ants under my skin.

172
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,095
It's been
that way forever.

173
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,222
I remember
when I was 15,

174
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,351
I had a crush on one of
my mother's piano students.

175
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:44,732
Somehow I overheard her saying
very nasty things about me.

176
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,735
I got so angry.

177
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,696
I took an iron.

178
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,534
Is that him?

179
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,411
I...

180
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,913
We only spoke
on the phone.

181
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,710
It's such a shame because he's
one of my best geologists.

182
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,547
He said you asked
to buy information.

183
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,968
No. He called me and offered
to sell me information.

184
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,264
Why would I come back here
if I was lying?

185
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,184
Because
you love me.

186
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,436
I was doing it
for you.

187
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,939
To stop him
from betraying you.

188
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,069
You know what burns more
than all your bullshit?

189
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:34,365
Is that I always got the feeling
that you were only sleeping with me

190
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,617
to get to General Medrano.

191
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,287
Is that him?

192
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:44,208
You know how these
deposed dictators are,

193
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,335
jealous of their safety.

194
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,880
Stick around.

195
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,466
I'll introduce you.

196
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,053
Do you see the girl
that just walked in here?

197
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,055
Could you give her that?
Tell her to call me.

198
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,618
You've
reached Universal Exports.

199
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,996
Our offices are
currently closed.

200
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,131
And you can do
all this for me?

201
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,217
Well, look at what we
did to this country.

202
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,636
The Haitians elect a priest

203
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,265
who decides to raise the minimum
wage from 38 cents to $1 a day.

204
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,516
Whoa!

205
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,020
It's not a lot, but it's enough
to upset the corporations

206
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,856
who were here making
T-shirts and running shoes.

207
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,816
So they called us,

208
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,736
and we facilitated
a change.

209
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,903
The difference is,

210
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:59,116
my country's not some flyspeck
in the middle of the Caribbean.

211
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,244
But we've already begun
destabilizing the government.

212
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,538
We'll supply
the private security.

213
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,915
We'll pay off
the right officials,

214
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,462
and we have 26 countries
ready to officially recognize

215
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,048
your new
Bolivian government.

216
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,259
You want your
country back.

217
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,554
My organization can give
it to you within the week.

218
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,683
You've been busy.

219
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,519
And in return
you want what?

220
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,563
A desert.

221
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,155
This part.

222
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,949
This land is worthless.
Oh.

223
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,786
So you're getting
a great deal.

224
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,829
You won't find
oil there.

225
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,331
Everyone has tried.

226
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,417
Maybe, maybe not.

227
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,254
But we own
whatever we find.

228
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,806
Did you know
Ernesto Montes?

229
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,101
A very powerful man
in his day.

230
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,645
He had a beautiful
Russian wife.

231
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,897
A dancer.

232
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,192
Well, his daughter
works for me.

233
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,069
Or did.

234
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,238
She's lovely,

235
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,865
but I don't see
the resemblance.

236
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,575
Why don't you
consider her

237
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,786
as something to
sweeten the deal?

238
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,916
Just promise me to drop her
over the side when you're done.

239
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,922
Camille,
General Medrano.

240
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,857
Be careful what you
wish for, my dear.

241
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,076
Have fun, you two.

242
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,281
What the hell
are you doing?

243
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,408
You're welcome!
You idiot! Take me back!

244
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,244
You know, maybe
I'll do that later.

245
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,250
You're not one
of Greene's.

246
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,961
Dominic Greene?

247
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,383
Get down!

248
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,158
Give me the wheel!

249
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,493
Navigate!

250
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,709
Left!

251
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,346
What are you doing?
Hold on!

252
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,615
Get down!

253
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,405
Excuse me.

254
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,864
Thank you. She's seasick.

255
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,149
It's Bond.

256
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:48,775
Connect Bond.

257
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,360
Connecting 007.
Yes?

258
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,821
Name check,
Dominic Greene.

259
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,115
G-R-E-E-N-E.

260
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,744
I might need a little
more than that.

261
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,828
There are a lot of
Dominic Greenes.

262
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,079
Do you have
a social security

263
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,456
or passport number?
No.

264
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,791
Scanning DGSE databases.

265
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,836
Anything?
Scanning KGB databases.

266
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,088
Do you have anything?
Will you put her on, please?

267
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,340
I am on, Bond.
What happened to Slate?

268
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,051
I'm not dwelling
on the past.

269
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,218
I don't think
you should, either.

270
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,303
You killed him.

271
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,389
Largest hit, Dominic Greene,
CEO of Greene Planet.

272
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,349
It's a utility company,

273
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,894
but Greene's been doing
a lot of philanthropic work,

274
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,480
buying up large tracts of land
for ecological preserves.

275
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,774
You should be getting
his picture now.

276
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,734
Yep, that's him.

277
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,237
I'm afraid there's a firewall around
his other corporate holdings,

278
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,447
so we have no
other information.

279
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,531
Get me the Americans.

280
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,283
Connecting.

281
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,701
Go ahead.

282
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,496
Interest in Dominic Greene,
Greene Planet.

283
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,914
Transferring you now.

284
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,502
Hold for
Gregory Beam, please.

285
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,420
Thank you.

286
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,422
Hi, this is
Gregory Beam, ma'am.

287
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,507
Hello, Mr. Beam.

288
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,844
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
We have no interest in Mr. Greene.

289
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,346
Thank you, Mr. Beam.

290
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,472
Connection terminated.

291
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,057
He's a person of
extreme interest.

292
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,810
But he just said that he wasn't...
Tanner, I asked about the man

293
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,562
and she transferred me to the
section chief of South America.

294
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,689
How would she know to do that
if they weren't tracking him?

295
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,614
Bond, we have your location
as approaching an airfield.

296
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,574
Is Greene on the move?
Yeah.

297
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,828
I've got a tail number,
Golf-Zero-Charlie-Sierra-Charlie.

298
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,912
Get me a destination.

299
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:31,169
It's a private charter
going to Bregenz, Austria,

300
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,379
leaving immediately.

301
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,006
Tanner, authorize
a charter for 007.

302
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:40,137
And, Bond, if you could avoid
killing every possible lead,

303
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,471
it would be
deeply appreciated.

304
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,224
Yes, ma'am.
I'll do my best.

305
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,393
Connection terminated.

306
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,727
I've heard that before.

307
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,107
Hello.
Hi.

308
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,900
Ah. Welcome aboard.

309
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
Come. Have a seat.

310
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,241
Charlie-Sierra-Charlie.

311
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,425
Jeez.

312
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,260
Sorry.

313
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,056
How much longer?

314
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,853
So do we have
an understanding?

315
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,982
Uh, yeah. We do nothing to
stop a coup in Bolivia,

316
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,359
and in exchange,
the new government

317
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,237
gives America the lease
to any oil found.

318
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,990
If it's oil
you want.

319
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,119
Well, you didn't find
diamonds, did you?

320
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:55,629
Drilling underground, you kept off
everybody's radar for a very long time,

321
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,505
but you can't buy
that much piping

322
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,633
without somebody
getting curious.

323
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,969
We'll have to
verify the find.

324
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:07,474
I'm not even admitting there is one.
You are getting this for free.

325
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,311
Venezuela, Brazil,
now Bolivia.

326
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,104
With you tied up
in the Middle East,

327
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,273
South America is falling
like dominoes.

328
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:21,947
You don't need another Marxist giving
national resources to the people, do you?

329
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,616
Well, we can hardly be
expected to do something

330
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,660
about a coup
we know nothing about.

331
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,666
And I have
a pest.

332
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,085
This.

333
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,257
You have any idea
who that is?

334
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,602
Sorry.

335
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,774
It's James Bond,
British Secret Service.

336
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,027
I don't know how
I could have missed that.

337
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,573
I will need you to get
rid of him for me.

338
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,702
Yeah. That's not
gonna be a problem.

339
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,511
You know who Greene is

340
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,637
and you wanna put us
in bed with him.

341
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,723
You are kidding,
right?

342
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,225
Yeah. You're right. We should
just deal with nice people.

343
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,103
I need to know
you're on the team, Felix.

344
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,856
I need to know
you value your career.

345
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,472
Dominic Greene.

346
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,575
Good to see you.
How are you?

347
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,285
Good. Thank you.

348
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,823
Ladies and gentlemen,

349
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:57,120
tonight's performance ofTosca will
begin shortly. Please take your seats.

350
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,052
What else
does General Medrano require?

351
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,410
Anything
further from Canadian intelligence?

352
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,828
We'll discuss that later.

353
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,123
How much more
pipeline do we need?

354
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,126
Ideally,
2,000 kilometers.

355
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,878
Are there
any objections?

356
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,798
No.

357
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,216
Not here.

358
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,717
No objections.

359
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,720
Transfer the funds
from our Siberian holdings.

360
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,931
Done.

361
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,436
Where do the
Americans stand?

362
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:49,899
Well, the CIA doesn't care about another
dictator as long as they get their end.

363
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,569
But when they find out
that they've been duped?

364
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,903
I'm working on that.

365
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:58,283
I'm still not sure that the Tierra
Project is the best use of Quantum's time.

366
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,743
Perhaps we should shift
our focus to the Canadian.

367
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,580
This is the world's
most precious resource.

368
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,541
We need to control
as much of it as we can.

369
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,835
Bolivia must be
top priority.

370
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,336
Can I offer
an opinion?

371
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,426
I really think you people should
find a better place to meet.

372
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,058
Where do you think
you're going?

373
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,706
Thank you.

374
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,261
Well, Tosca isn't
for everyone.

375
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,545
Drop it.

376
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,675
So who are you
working for?

377
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,635
Piss off.

378
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,806
Get rid of anything we brought
with us. We've been compromised.

379
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,562
I asked you who
you were working for.

380
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,075
Is he
one of ours?

381
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,160
No.

382
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,078
Then he shouldn't
be looking at me.

383
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,672
Get me M.

384
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,468
It's your line.
Thanks.

385
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,428
Connect call.

386
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,929
Connecting Tanner.

387
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,473
We've ID'd
the pictures.

388
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,849
Show me.

389
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,934
Gregor Karakov,
former minister,

390
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,728
now owns most of the
mines in Siberia,

391
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:18,357
Moishe Soref, former
Mossad, now telecom giant,

392
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,110
and Guy Haines, special envoy
to the Prime Minister.

393
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,195
Get Bond.

394
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,905
There's something else.

395
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:28,576
It appears Bond shot Haines'
bodyguard and threw him off a roof.

396
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,415
Where are you? Did
you get my pictures?

397
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,793
Was this a conversation?
Can you link these people?

398
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,252
Is that stress
in your voice?

399
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,712
I need you to
come in and debrief.

400
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,506
I don't have time.
Bond,

401
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,965
You killed a man in Bregenz.

402
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,425
I did my best not to.

403
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,385
You shot him at point blank
and threw him off a roof.

404
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,054
I'd hardly call that
showing restraint,

405
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,389
especially since he was
a member of Special Branch.

406
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,645
So who was he guarding?

407
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,356
Bond, are you missing the fact that you
killed a member of Special Branch?

408
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,649
I need you to come in.

409
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,945
And I would, but right now I need to
find the man who tried to kill you.

410
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:05,863
Go back to sleep.

411
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,240
Connection terminated.

412
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,909
Restrict Bond's movements.
Cancel his cards.

413
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,286
Put an alert on his passports.
All of them.

414
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,622
And I want to know everything
we don't know about Haines.

415
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,748
Yes, ma'am.

416
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,417
And, Tanner, be careful
who you trust with this.

417
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,420
Hopefully, you're a better
judge of character than I am.

418
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,466
You want to follow your
friends to La Paz, Bolivia?

419
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,843
Please.

420
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,053
Oh.

421
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,847
I'm sorry, sir,
but this doesn't work.

422
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,265
Do you have
another card?

423
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,517
No.

424
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,899
Could you do me
a favor?

425
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,860
You're gonna get
a phone call in a minute.

426
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,153
Would you mind telling them
I'm headed for Cairo?

427
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,782
I'd be happy to.
Thank you.

428
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,157
Mathis.

429
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,159
What do you want?

430
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,536
Come to apologize?

431
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,707
You know, Mathis,

432
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,501
I think retirement
suits you.

433
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,295
None for him.

434
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,673
Sorry. He's in
a bad mood today.

435
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,366
I need a passport
and matching credit cards.

436
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,535
And MI6 ran out
of plastic?

437
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,623
Well, oddly, right now, you're the
only person I think I can trust.

438
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:21,791
That is odd.

439
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,293
But I guess
when one's young,

440
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:28,089
it seems very easy to distinguish
between right and wrong.

441
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:31,133
But as one gets older,
it becomes more difficult.

442
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,220
The villains and the heroes
get all mixed up.

443
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,598
I was sorry to hear
about Vesper.

444
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,517
I think she loved you.

445
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,810
Mmm.

446
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,895
Right up until the moment
she betrayed me.

447
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,690
She died for you.

448
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,528
Why did you really
want to see me?

449
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,906
I need some information.

450
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,160
Ah.

451
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:02,456
You have some hard friends. This
man is some kind of facilitator.

452
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:05,918
Fingers in many pies, and
they don't leave any prints.

453
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,712
These men
were together?

454
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,630
They're buying up
oil pipeline.

455
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,133
Something called the Tierra Project.
Do you know it?

456
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,592
Destroy these.

457
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,594
That's Guy Haines.
You don't know him?

458
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:16,804
Should I?

459
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:20,599
I suppose not. You haven't
been keeping secrets as long as I have.

460
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,060
He keeps
a very low profile,

461
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,480
but he's one of the Prime
Minister's closest advisors.

462
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,817
Well, they say you're judged by
the strength of your enemies.

463
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,403
Do you know anything
about Bolivia?

464
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,282
I was stationed in South
America for seven years.

465
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,616
Well, do you have
some contacts there?

466
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,243
A few.

467
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,745
What do you want
to know?

468
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,956
Come with me.

469
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,655
You can't sleep?

470
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,075
May I fix you
a drink, sir?

471
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,077
What are you
drinking?

472
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,329
I don't know.
What am I drinking?

473
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,374
Three measures of Gordon's
gin, one of vodka, half of...

474
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:30,503
Kina Lillet. Kina Lillet,
which is not Vermouth,

475
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,296
shaken well
until it is ice-cold,

476
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,674
then served with a large
thin slice of lemon peel.

477
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,760
Six of them.

478
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,762
That's impressive.

479
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,347
They're good.
You should have one.

480
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,433
No, it'll just
keep me awake.

481
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,856
So what's
keeping you awake?

482
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,237
I was wondering
why you came with me.

483
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:01,367
It takes something
to admit you were wrong.

484
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,996
You want
a sleeping pill?

485
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,164
No.

486
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,874
Pain pill?
No.

487
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,085
I have pills
for everything.

488
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,129
Some make you taller.

489
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,090
Some make you forget.

490
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,263
I'm going to try
and get some sleep.

491
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,722
Good idea.

492
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,072
Thank you.

493
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,534
Mr. Bond, my name is Fields.
I'm from the consulate.

494
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:44,618
Well, of course
you are.

495
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,036
And what do you do at
the consulate, Fields?

496
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,413
That's not
important.

497
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,747
My orders are
to turn you around

498
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,875
and put you on the first
plane back to London.

499
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,626
Do those orders include
my friend Mathis?

500
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,045
I'm sorry, I don't
know who you are.

501
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,757
You see that? Gone such a short
time and already forgotten.

502
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,259
You're just
saying that to hurt me.

503
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:03,762
Mr. Bond, these orders come from
the highest possible authority.

504
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,807
Taxi. Fields, when is
the next flight to London?

505
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,309
Tomorrow morning.

506
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,393
Well then,
we have all night.

507
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,061
If you attempt to flee,
I will arrest you,

508
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,606
drop you off in jail and take
you to the plane in chains.

509
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,233
Understand?
Perfectly. After you.

510
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,695
I think
she has handcuffs.

511
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:20,779
I do hope so.

512
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,456
He blames the water
shortage on global warming.

513
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:34,335
Hello, Carlos?
Carlos.

514
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,424
The Colonel who heads
the National Police.

515
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:06,867
We have a reservation.

516
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,079
C�mo est�?
Very well, thank you.

517
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,539
Your name?
Miss Fields.

518
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,171
You're going nowhere.
So shoot me.

519
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,256
I'd rather
stay in a morgue.

520
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,758
We are teachers on sabbatical.
This fits our cover.

521
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,177
No, it doesn't.
Get in.

522
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,512
Get in!

523
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:55,040
Follow me, please.

524
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,424
May I show you
your room, senor?

525
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,717
No, it's fine.
Thank you.

526
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,820
I can't find the, um...

527
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,239
The stationery.

528
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,326
Will you come
and help me look?

529
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,759
You've been invited
to a party.

530
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,802
I didn't know we had
any friends here.

531
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,056
Greene Planet.

532
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,266
You're not coming?

533
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,518
I'm having a drink with
my friend the Colonel.

534
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,270
I'll see you
there later.

535
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:07,029
Do you know how angry
I am at myself?

536
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,864
I can't imagine.

537
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,494
You must be furious.

538
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,294
Do you want to go
to a party?

539
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,171
A party?

540
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:27,132
But I have
nothing to wear.

541
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,634
We'll fix that.

542
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,572
It might be useful
to know your real name.

543
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,074
Fields.

544
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,203
Just Fields.

545
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,414
Fields it is, then.

546
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:02,709
We are in a spiral
of environmental decline.

547
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:09,925
Since 1945, 17% of the
planet's vegetated surface

548
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,886
has been
irreversibly degraded.

549
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,059
The Tierra Project is just one small
part of a global network of Eco Parks

550
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,186
that Greene Planet
has created

551
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:25,691
to rejuvenate a world
on the verge of collapse.

552
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:31,655
I hope that tonight you make the
decision to be part of that.

553
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,033
Thank you.

554
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,789
And have fun.

555
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,542
Congratulations.
Thank you.

556
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,336
Excellent speech
and congratulations.

557
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,547
Wonderful speech,
Dominic.

558
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:49,798
We need you here.
Thank you.

559
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,927
Miss Fields, Mr. Bond,
my friend Carlos.

560
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,888
Pleased to meet you.
Ma'am.

561
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,933
Mr. Bond, Mathis has spoken
a great deal about you.

562
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:03,520
I want you to know my entire
police force is at your disposal.

563
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,689
Well, that could
be very useful.

564
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:09,026
You know, there are people in this
country spending half their paycheck

565
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,611
just to get
clean water.

566
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:11,737
What do you
think of that?

567
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,906
The Bolivian government
is the problem.

568
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,657
They cut down the trees,

569
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:19,870
then act surprised when the water
and the soil wash out to sea.

570
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:23,457
I couldn't agree more. I hope
this figure is to your liking.

571
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,918
Ch�ri, you
shouldn't tease.

572
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:30,047
Why don't you tell them about all the
land you bought up outside Potos�?

573
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,341
It's been a pleasure.
Will you excuse me?

574
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,759
Of course.

575
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,010
Somehow
the logging rights

576
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:38,514
went to a multinational corporation
that cut down the forests,

577
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:43,352
but only after our last government
sold the land to Greene Planet.

578
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,272
Or have I got
my facts crossed?

579
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,274
Yes,
I think you did.

580
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,360
You'll excuse us?

581
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:53,987
What a wonderful night.

582
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,619
You just cost me quite a
bit of money, darling.

583
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,496
You can't put a
price on integrity.

584
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,540
I can try.

585
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,624
Oh!

586
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:11,880
Thank you.

587
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:15,926
Tell me you didn't drop by tonight
just to piss on my parade.

588
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,471
Or are you still after this
General's head for your mantel?

589
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,557
A little of both.

590
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:25,394
Tell me where Medrano is and maybe
you won't lose any more investors.

591
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,567
You are really
breaking my heart,

592
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,819
choosing an insect
like that over me.

593
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,989
Are you going
to throw me over?

594
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:39,241
No. You've
been drinking,

595
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,367
so maybe you slipped.

596
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:44,830
Oh. Just think
how much you'd miss me.

597
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,836
Good evening.

598
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,838
There you are.

599
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:55,882
Would you
excuse me?

600
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,051
Mr. Bond.

601
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,262
What a pleasure.

602
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,100
Well, careful with this one.
She won't go to bed with you

603
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,311
unless you give her
something she really wants.

604
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,105
It's a shame because
she's really quite stunning

605
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,316
once you get her
on her back.

606
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,736
I wish I could say
the feeling was mutual.

607
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,112
I'm sorry, Mr. Greene,
but we have to go.

608
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,114
Please. My friends
call me Dominic.

609
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,866
I'm sure they do.

610
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,745
How much do you know
about Bond, Camille?

611
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:27,122
Because he's rather
a tragic case.

612
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:30,125
As MI6 says, he's
difficult to control.

613
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:34,838
Nice way of saying that everything
he touches seems to wither and die.

614
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:36,131
Shall we?

615
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:37,966
Doesn't bode well
for you, I'm afraid.

616
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,927
You two do make
a charming couple, though.

617
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,930
You're both...
What's the expression?

618
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,641
Damaged goods.

619
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,103
Oh, my gosh!

620
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:52,648
I'm so sorry.

621
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:59,112
Come on, lighten up.
You're cramping my style.

622
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,991
So it's British
intelligence now.

623
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,618
What the hell do
you want from me?

624
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:07,454
You're gonna show me Dominic
Greene's Tierra Project.

625
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,122
Are you up to it?
Do I have a choice?

626
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:10,707
Do you want one?

627
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,752
There's something horribly
efficient about you.

628
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,796
Is that a compliment?

629
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:32,813
Well, what's the bet that Dominic
Greene has friends in the police force?

630
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,201
Stay here.

631
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,599
Now, why would
you want me to do that?

632
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:42,674
Mathis?

633
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,053
There's a hospital
on the other side of town.

634
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,473
Please.

635
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,267
Stay with me.

636
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,603
Stay here, please.

637
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,730
Please.

638
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:59,191
Come here.

639
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,361
It's okay.

640
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:06,823
That's better.

641
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,867
That doesn't hurt.

642
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:14,122
Is Mathis
your cover name?

643
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,374
Yes.

644
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,587
Not a very
good one, is it?

645
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,969
Do we forgive
each other?

646
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,266
I shouldn't have
left you alone.

647
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,228
Vesper.

648
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:39,606
She gave everything
for you.

649
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,401
Forgive her.

650
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,322
Forgive yourself.

651
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,595
Is that how you
treat your friends?

652
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:14,266
He wouldn't care.

653
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:21,898
Let's go.

654
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,124
The Foreign Secretary's
asking to see you.

655
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,042
What don't I know?

656
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:44,170
Rene Mathis has been
shot dead in Bolivia.

657
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:46,298
The police claim
it was Bond.

658
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:22,500
How much
did you pay him?

659
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,921
Well, he wanted you, but I left
him the car as collateral.

660
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:28,256
He'll make much more
when he sells us out.

661
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:32,886
Right.

662
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,930
Let's see if
this thing'll fly.

663
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:51,947
Here.

664
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,991
All the information I found said
there was nothing of value there,

665
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,827
but Greene's geologist
had proof that there was.

666
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:05,627
My sources tell me you're
Bolivian Secret Service,

667
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,338
or used to be,

668
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:12,092
and that you infiltrated Greene's
organization by having sex with him.

669
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:15,804
That offends you?
No, not in the slightest.

670
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:18,390
So what's your
interest in Greene?

671
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,352
Amongst other things, he tried
to kill a friend of mine.

672
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:23,937
A woman?
Yes.

673
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,939
But it's not
what you think.

674
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,190
Your mother?

675
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:28,525
She likes to think so.

676
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,739
What's that down there?

677
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,910
That's a sinkhole.

678
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,578
There are a few
around here.

679
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,833
Just for the record,
I wasn't with Greene for my...

680
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,037
Damn it!

681
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:52,650
I think we lost him!

682
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:03,411
He's coming fast!

683
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,710
He's right behind you!

684
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:36,629
Here. Put that on!

685
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:22,759
Come on!

686
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,657
Camille!

687
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,595
According to the Bolivians,
it was a routine stop,

688
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,682
and when they discovered Mathis'
body, Bond disarmed and shot them.

689
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,892
Of course, there are no
witnesses to prove otherwise.

690
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:15,770
I need something. I can't
go in there unarmed.

691
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:17,188
I'm sorry.
There's nothing.

692
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,693
Come in.

693
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:25,780
What's today's excuse?
That Bond is legally blind?

694
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:27,824
No, Minister.

695
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:30,702
I don't think I need to tell
you how upset the PM is.

696
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:33,663
With respect, the PM
has my direct line.

697
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,915
And he'd have used it if
he'd wanted to speak to you.

698
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:40,420
I'm sorry, M.
Things have changed.

699
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:43,131
We've had long discussions
with our cousins.

700
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:45,216
Mr. Greene's interests
and ours now align.

701
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,552
Minister, this man
is a major player

702
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,971
in one of the most
dangerous organizations...

703
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:51,973
We've never
even heard of.

704
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:55,393
Foreign policy cannot be conducted on
the basis of hunches and innuendo.

705
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,645
Then give us time
to gather enough evidence

706
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,731
so you can make
informed decisions.

707
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,107
Fine.

708
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,320
Say you're right.
Say Greene is a villain.

709
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,071
If we refused to do
business with villains,

710
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,240
we'd have almost
no one to trade with.

711
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:11,826
The world's running
out of oil, M.

712
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,161
The Russians
aren't playing ball.

713
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:15,538
The Americans and Chinese
are dividing up what's left.

714
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:17,582
Right or wrong
doesn't come into it.

715
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,126
We're acting
out of necessity.

716
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,840
Bond is running wild.

717
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,760
Who's to say he
hasn't been turned?

718
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,387
Pull him in

719
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:34,098
or the Americans
will put him down.

720
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:39,062
I think I found
a way out.

721
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:41,939
You're freezing.

722
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,025
I'm fine.

723
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,794
So what is it that Greene
has that you want?

724
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:12,220
It's not Greene. It's Medrano,
the man he met in Haiti.

725
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:17,266
My father worked
for the military junta.

726
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:19,852
He was a very
cruel man,

727
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,564
but he was my father.

728
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:28,653
When I was a small child

729
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:32,573
the opposition sent general
Medrano to our house.

730
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:36,744
He shot my father.

731
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:40,456
He did things to my
mother and my sister

732
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,293
and then strangled them
while I watched.

733
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:48,923
I was too young
to be any trouble,

734
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,343
so he just smiled at me

735
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:56,973
and set the house
on fire.

736
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,352
He left his mark.

737
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,899
So when I pulled you
off the boat...

738
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:09,360
I waited years
for that chance.

739
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:11,904
I apologize.

740
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,201
It seems we're both using
Greene to get to somebody.

741
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:20,329
You lost somebody?

742
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:22,790
I did, yes.

743
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,209
You catch
whoever did it?

744
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:27,420
No.

745
01:14:27,504 --> 01:14:28,754
Not yet.

746
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,591
Tell me when you do.

747
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,844
I'd like to know
how it feels.

748
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:41,601
We should go.

749
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,436
You ready?

750
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,388
They used dynamite.

751
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:23,935
This used to be
a riverbed.

752
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:42,703
Greene isn't
after the oil.

753
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:44,997
He wants
the water.

754
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,792
We can't leave it
like this.

755
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:51,921
It's one dam. He's creating a drought.
He'll have built others.

756
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:24,472
Excuse me, sir. Your
wife left a message.

757
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:26,223
The English woman, she left
it for you this morning.

758
01:17:27,517 --> 01:17:28,893
Thank you.
My pleasure.

759
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,813
What is it?

760
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:36,567
Would you mind
waiting down here?

761
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:39,070
I'll be outside.

762
01:17:57,881 --> 01:17:59,298
So that's
what she meant.

763
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,759
I hope you can
trust these men.

764
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:04,261
Just a moment.
It's Tanner.

765
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:05,888
Yes?

766
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:08,849
We've got the
girl downstairs.

767
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:11,185
She says to tell you she's sorry
but this is not her fight.

768
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:12,395
It isn't. Let her go.

769
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,480
She isn't our concern.

770
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,233
Well, I'm
disappointed.

771
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:18,818
You are?

772
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:21,028
How much oil did the
Americans promise you?

773
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,196
This isn't
about oil.

774
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,531
Well, that's good,
because there isn't any.

775
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:25,449
It's about trust.

776
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,368
You said you weren't
motivated by revenge.

777
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:29,078
I'm motivated
by my duty.

778
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:30,621
No.

779
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:33,958
I think you are so blinded
by inconsolable rage

780
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,377
that you don't care
who you hurt.

781
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:39,797
When you can't tell your friends
from your enemies, it's time to go.

782
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:50,725
You might like to tell her your
theory about there being no oil.

783
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:51,934
Her lungs are
full of it.

784
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:57,148
It was Greene.
No doubt. But why?

785
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:01,819
It's just misdirection.
I mean, why her, Bond?

786
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:04,697
She was just supposed to send you home.
She worked in an office,

787
01:19:04,781 --> 01:19:06,115
collecting reports.

788
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,285
Look how well your
charm works, James.

789
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:12,496
They'll do anything
for you, won't they?

790
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:14,832
How many is
that now?

791
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:19,170
You're removed from duty and suspended
pending further investigation.

792
01:19:20,046 --> 01:19:23,674
You'll give whatever weapons you have
to these men and leave with them now.

793
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,639
Miss Fields
showed true bravery.

794
01:20:11,723 --> 01:20:13,641
I want that mentioned
in your report.

795
01:20:13,725 --> 01:20:15,559
Now you and I need
to see this through.

796
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,644
There's nowhere to go.

797
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:18,479
There's a capture or
kill order out on you.

798
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,941
Who would have done that?

799
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:33,285
Ma'am? Find out
where he's going.

800
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:35,371
He's on to something.
Ma'am, the CIA is insisting...

801
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:37,998
I could give a shit about the CIA
or their trumped-up evidence.

802
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:39,917
He's my agent,
and I trust him.

803
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:41,544
Go on.

804
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:54,849
Get in.

805
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,225
Are you gonna try
and shoot me?

806
01:20:56,309 --> 01:20:57,893
I said, get in.

807
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:15,077
You're gonna get botulism
if you keep drinking that.

808
01:21:15,161 --> 01:21:17,037
It's bottled water.

809
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:20,833
It probably came from some stream
just around the corner from here.

810
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:22,668
Bunch of little kids
peeing in it.

811
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:26,088
That's why I eat
the peppers.

812
01:21:26,172 --> 01:21:28,465
Well, all
I'm saying is

813
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:31,260
You can't trust
a damn thing around here.

814
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:40,019
You know, you should just
answer, "CIA," Felix.

815
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:41,979
A taxi driver told me
where the office was.

816
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,690
Well, if we're so easy
to find, James,

817
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,901
you really should
come visit.

818
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:49,737
Or maybe you should come out
and see some more of the city.

819
01:22:11,384 --> 01:22:13,302
I heard a rumor
you'd gone native.

820
01:22:13,386 --> 01:22:14,678
Felix.

821
01:22:19,809 --> 01:22:22,061
You know, I was just wondering
what South America would look like

822
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:24,271
if nobody gave a damn
about coke or communism.

823
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,941
It's always impressed me the way you
boys have carved this place up.

824
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:29,860
I'll take that as a compliment
coming from a Brit.

825
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:33,656
Are you sure you're playing
with the right side?

826
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:36,825
Regimes change
once a week down here.

827
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:38,786
Medrano'll be no dirtier
than the next guy.

828
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:40,913
Oh, you see, that's what I like about U.S.
Intelligence.

829
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:42,414
You'll lie down
with anybody.

830
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:44,917
Including you, brother.
Including you.

831
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:46,293
Do you know
you're being played?

832
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,838
Dominic Greene's gonna suck this place
dry, and then he's gonna move on,

833
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,924
and you're gonna be left picking
up the broken crockery.

834
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:55,094
What can I tell you? There's
no such thing as a free lunch.

835
01:22:55,178 --> 01:22:57,096
Well, you see, Felix, I don't
think you're half as cynical

836
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,305
as you make out to be.

837
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:59,890
You don't know me.

838
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:04,979
Why? Just because
you didn't come alone?

839
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:07,189
How long
have I got?

840
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:08,273
Thirty seconds.

841
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:13,153
Well, that doesn't give us
a lot of time, does it?

842
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:17,741
Medrano can't move until he pays
off the army and the police chief.

843
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,119
Greene's bringing him
his money now.

844
01:23:20,203 --> 01:23:22,579
A hotel called
La Perla de las Dunas

845
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,206
in the desert.

846
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:25,332
Thank you, Felix.

847
01:23:26,459 --> 01:23:28,168
James, move your ass.

848
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:31,422
Get down!
Get down, now!

849
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:48,188
Move it! Move it!

850
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:57,197
What the hell happened?
What did you tell him?

851
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:59,283
Just what we agreed.

852
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:25,035
What are you doing?

853
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:28,705
The slide's caught.

854
01:25:29,707 --> 01:25:31,375
Maybe you should
check your own.

855
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:33,127
I will.

856
01:25:38,424 --> 01:25:39,967
Have you ever
killed someone?

857
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,223
Your training will tell you that
when the adrenaline kicks in

858
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:48,183
you should
compensate.

859
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:50,853
But part of you is not
gonna believe the training

860
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:52,563
because this kill
is personal.

861
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,650
Take a deep breath.

862
01:25:56,734 --> 01:25:58,485
You only need one shot.

863
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,404
Make it count.

864
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:00,631
Pendejo.

865
01:27:07,138 --> 01:27:08,472
In euros,

866
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:10,807
as requested.

867
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:13,518
The dollar isn't
what it once was.

868
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:15,812
The cost of war.

869
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:20,651
I am afraid that the corruption
in this current government

870
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:22,236
can no longer
be tolerated.

871
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:27,074
And mine?

872
01:27:27,825 --> 01:27:29,534
Right after you
sign over my land.

873
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:47,594
My first official act.

874
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:54,851
And this, if you would.

875
01:27:55,853 --> 01:27:57,187
What is this?

876
01:27:57,313 --> 01:27:58,438
As of this moment,

877
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:03,527
my organization owns more than
60% of Bolivia's water supply.

878
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:07,281
So this contract states
that your new government

879
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:10,325
will use us as
utilities provider.

880
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:13,245
This is double
what we are paying now.

881
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:19,793
Well, then
don't sign it.

882
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:25,132
But you should know something about
me and the people I work with.

883
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:28,302
We deal with the
left or the right,

884
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:32,055
with dictators
or liberators.

885
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:35,267
If the current president
had been more agreeable,

886
01:28:35,351 --> 01:28:37,561
I wouldn't be
talking to you.

887
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:39,896
So, if you decide
not to sign,

888
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,149
you will wake up with
your balls in your mouth

889
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:44,693
and your willing replacement
standing over you.

890
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:49,698
If you doubt that,
then shoot me,

891
01:28:49,782 --> 01:28:52,409
take that money and have
a good night's sleep.

892
01:29:53,429 --> 01:29:54,763
You and I had
a mutual friend.

893
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:48,770
Sounds like you
just lost another one.

894
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:00,550
Not this way.
Not this way.

895
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:03,178
I can't. I can't.

896
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:15,690
Come here.

897
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:22,530
Like you said,

898
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:24,491
"Take a deep breath.

899
01:34:25,743 --> 01:34:27,410
"Make it count."

900
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:35,251
Close your eyes.

901
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:44,969
Come on!

902
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:00,777
Wait here.

903
01:35:33,102 --> 01:35:34,102
You promised
that you'd...

904
01:35:34,186 --> 01:35:35,270
Let you go?

905
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:38,732
I answered
your questions.

906
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:41,568
I told you what you wanted
to know about Quantum.

907
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:43,194
Yes, you did,

908
01:35:43,612 --> 01:35:44,654
and your friends'd
know that

909
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,239
so they're probably
looking for you.

910
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:50,326
But the good news is, you're
in the middle of a desert.

911
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:55,373
Here.

912
01:35:57,293 --> 01:36:00,336
I bet you make it 20 miles before
you consider drinking that.

913
01:36:01,046 --> 01:36:02,255
Goodbye, Mr. Greene.

914
01:36:42,671 --> 01:36:44,088
Thank you.

915
01:36:44,882 --> 01:36:46,257
It's my pleasure.

916
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:49,552
Are you all right?

917
01:36:50,012 --> 01:36:51,221
Fine.

918
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:54,015
But I keep thinking,
"He's dead.

919
01:36:54,391 --> 01:36:55,767
"Now what?"

920
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:58,686
Well, the dam we saw
will have to come down,

921
01:36:58,771 --> 01:36:59,813
and there'll
be others, too.

922
01:36:59,897 --> 01:37:01,898
Someone who worked for
Greene might be of help.

923
01:37:03,692 --> 01:37:05,485
Not a bad idea.

924
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:12,659
Do you think they'll
be able to sleep now?

925
01:37:15,412 --> 01:37:18,414
I don't think the dead
care about vengeance.

926
01:37:20,793 --> 01:37:23,002
I wish I could
set you free.

927
01:37:27,424 --> 01:37:29,592
But your prison
is in there.

928
01:38:20,936 --> 01:38:23,313
Fine. Anything
for an easy life.

929
01:38:26,817 --> 01:38:28,234
Sit down.

930
01:38:28,986 --> 01:38:30,320
Sit down!

931
01:38:31,655 --> 01:38:33,281
It's okay, baby.

932
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:51,716
You're Canadian?

933
01:38:52,259 --> 01:38:53,843
You work in
Canadian intelligence?

934
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,971
It's all right.
I know you do.

935
01:38:57,473 --> 01:38:59,307
And knowing this man,

936
01:38:59,391 --> 01:39:01,935
I'd guess you have access to
some very sensitive material

937
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:04,103
which you're gonna
be forced to give up.

938
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:05,355
His life will
be threatened,

939
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:07,690
and because you love him,
you won't hesitate.

940
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,902
It's a beautiful
necklace.

941
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:13,488
Did he give it to you?

942
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,367
I have one
just like it.

943
01:39:20,996 --> 01:39:22,372
He gave it to
a friend of mine,

944
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,500
someone very
close to me.

945
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:30,546
Your name is?

946
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:32,382
Corrine.
Corrine.

947
01:39:33,008 --> 01:39:34,467
Corrine, I suggest
you leave now.

948
01:39:34,551 --> 01:39:37,011
You contact your people, and you
tell them to check their seals.

949
01:39:37,096 --> 01:39:38,388
They have a leak.

950
01:39:39,014 --> 01:39:40,807
Do it now, please.

951
01:39:41,725 --> 01:39:44,185
This man and I have
some unfinished business.

952
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:56,781
Thank you.

953
01:40:01,453 --> 01:40:02,745
Please.

954
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:04,998
Make it quick.

955
01:40:14,383 --> 01:40:15,800
Is he still alive?

956
01:40:15,884 --> 01:40:16,884
He is.

957
01:40:17,594 --> 01:40:19,178
I'm surprised.

958
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:21,931
Did you find what you
were looking for?

959
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:23,433
Yes.
Good.

960
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:26,436
I assume you have
no regrets.

961
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,062
I don't.

962
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:29,355
What about you?

963
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:33,151
Of course not. That would
be unprofessional.

964
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:35,194
They found Greene dead

965
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:38,031
in the middle of the Bolivian
desert, of all places.

966
01:40:38,115 --> 01:40:40,533
Two bullets in the
back of his skull.

967
01:40:40,617 --> 01:40:42,744
They found motor oil
in his stomach.

968
01:40:43,412 --> 01:40:45,371
Does that mean
anything to you?

969
01:40:45,456 --> 01:40:46,789
Wish I could help.

970
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:50,209
You'll be glad to know, I straightened
things out with the Americans.

971
01:40:50,294 --> 01:40:53,629
Your friend Leiter's been promoted.
He replaced Beam.

972
01:40:53,756 --> 01:40:56,174
Well, then the right
people kept their jobs.

973
01:40:56,258 --> 01:40:58,009
Something like that.

974
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:01,304
Congratulations.
You were right.

975
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:03,639
About what?

976
01:41:04,183 --> 01:41:05,808
About Vesper.

977
01:41:08,145 --> 01:41:09,479
Ma'am.

978
01:41:11,815 --> 01:41:13,066
Bond,

979
01:41:14,443 --> 01:41:16,152
I need you back.

980
01:41:16,528 --> 01:41:18,029
I never left.
