1
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,734
Are you here to kill me?

2
00:02:20,414 --> 00:02:22,905
I know what this is.

3
00:02:23,985 --> 00:02:29,150
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

4
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:35,661
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

5
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:42,762
A man possessed
of some radical notions.

6
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:49,508
What is the most resilient parasite?

7
00:02:49,777 --> 00:02:53,144
A bacteria? A virus?

8
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:54,976
An intestinal worm?

9
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:56,544
Uh...

10
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:58,344
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say--

11
00:02:58,519 --> 00:02:59,713
An idea.

12
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:03,513
Resilient. Highly contagious.

13
00:03:03,691 --> 00:03:07,684
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

14
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:12,395
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood, that sticks.

15
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,795
Right in there somewhere.

16
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:15,526
For someone like you to steal?

17
00:03:15,703 --> 00:03:18,638
Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered...

18
00:03:18,806 --> 00:03:21,240
...and that makes your thoughts
vulnerable to theft.

19
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,637
It's called extraction.

20
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,371
Mr. Saito, we can train
your subconscious to defend itself...

21
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:29,038
...from even the most
skilled extractor.

22
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:30,377
How can you do that?

23
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:33,384
Because I am the most
skilled extractor.

24
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:37,256
I know how to search your mind and
find your secrets. I know the tricks.

25
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,360
And I can teach them to you,
so that even when you're asleep...

26
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:42,860
...your defense is never down.

27
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:47,666
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.

28
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:51,202
I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife...

29
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:53,670
...better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

30
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,770
If this is a dream,
and you have a safe full of secrets...

31
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:59,276
...I need to know what's in that safe.

32
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,905
In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

33
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:10,416
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen,
as I consider your proposal.

34
00:04:12,894 --> 00:04:13,918
He knows.

35
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:18,431
What's going on up there?

36
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,281
Saito knows. He's playing with us.

37
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,022
Doesn't matter. I can get it here.
Trust me.

38
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,682
The information is in the safe.

39
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,021
He looked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.

40
00:05:23,397 --> 00:05:24,421
What's she doing here?

41
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,235
Just head back to the room.
All right? I'll take care of this.

42
00:05:30,404 --> 00:05:32,429
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.

43
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:45,545
If I jumped, would I survive?

44
00:05:47,922 --> 00:05:50,322
With a clean dive, perhaps.

45
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:52,152
Mal, what are you doing here?

46
00:05:52,326 --> 00:05:54,521
I thought you might be missing me.

47
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:55,955
You know that I am.

48
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,999
But I can't trust you anymore.

49
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,100
So what?

50
00:06:03,671 --> 00:06:05,866
Looks like Arthur's taste.

51
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,669
Actually, the subject is partial
to postwar British painters.

52
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,074
Please, have a seat.

53
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:22,254
Tell me...

54
00:06:22,656 --> 00:06:24,214
...do the children miss me?

55
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:30,257
You can't imagine.

56
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,527
What are you doing?

57
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:37,227
Just getting some fresh air.

58
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:39,401
Stay where you are, Mal.

59
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,951
Goddamn it.

60
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:58,375
Turn around.

61
00:07:58,552 --> 00:07:59,576
The gun, Dom.

62
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,989
Please.

63
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:24,475
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

64
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,280
Did she tell you?
Or have you known all along?

65
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:33,676
That you're here to steal from me,
or that we are actually asleep?

66
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:40,191
I want to know the name
of your employer.

67
00:08:42,196 --> 00:08:46,064
Ah, there's no use threatening him
in a dream, right, Mal?

68
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,701
That depends
on what you're threatening.

69
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:51,764
Killing him would just wake him up.

70
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,700
But pain...

71
00:08:57,645 --> 00:08:59,545
Pain is in the mind.

72
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:04,445
And judging by the decor,
we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

73
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:18,957
-What are you doing? It's too soon.
-But the dream's collapsing.

74
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:22,569
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under a
little bit longer. We're almost there.

75
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:40,743
He was close. Very close.

76
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:56,627
Stop him!

77
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:24,624
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.

78
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:47,386
He won't wake.

79
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,156
-Give him the kick.
-What?

80
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,718
Dunk him.

81
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:40,638
He's out.

82
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:48,005
You came prepared, hmm?

83
00:11:48,182 --> 00:11:52,016
Not even my head of security knows
this apartment. How did you find it?

84
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:56,384
It's difficult for a man of your position
to keep a love nest like this secret...

85
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:59,082
...particularly where there's
a married woman involved.

86
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,227
-She would never...
-Yet here we are.

87
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:04,389
-With a dilemma.
-They're getting closer.

88
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:07,329
-You got what you came for.
-Well, that's not true.

89
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:10,163
You left out a key piece of
information, didn't you?

90
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:13,534
You held something back
because you knew what we were up to.

91
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:16,574
-Question is, why'd you let us in at all?
-An audition.

92
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,713
-An audition for what?
-Doesn't matter. You failed.

93
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:23,577
We extracted every bit of information
you had in there.

94
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:26,282
But your deception was obvious.

95
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:11,598
-So leave me and go.
-You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.

96
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:15,997
That corporation that hired us,
they won't accept failure.

97
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,297
We won't last two days.

98
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,434
Cobb?

99
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:24,736
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this
a little more simply.

100
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:28,678
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!

101
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:34,919
I've always hated this carpet.

102
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:39,458
It's stained and frayed
in such distinctive ways.

103
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:44,294
But very definitely made of wool.

104
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:46,827
Right now...

105
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,302
...I'm lying on polyester.

106
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:59,009
Which means I'm not lying
on my carpet, in my apartment.

107
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,145
You have lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb.

108
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:05,609
I'm still dreaming.

109
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:14,123
-How'd it go?
-Not good.

110
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:23,629
Dream within a dream, huh?
I'm impressed.

111
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,397
But in my dream, you play by my rules.

112
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:30,839
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito...

113
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:32,410
We're not in your dream.

114
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,137
We're in mine.

115
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,184
Asshole.
How do you mess up the carpet?

116
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,658
-It wasn't my fault.
-You're the architect.

117
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:50,956
I didn't know
he was gonna rub his cheek on it!

118
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:52,223
That's enough.

119
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,857
You. What the hell was all that?

120
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:58,236
-I have it under control.
-I'd hate to see you out of control.

121
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:02,171
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.

122
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:04,173
He's not gonna check every compartment.

123
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:05,971
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.

124
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:08,910
Listen. Every man for himself.

125
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,280
Yes, hello?

126
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:27,085
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi, Dad.

127
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:31,223
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?
How you doing, huh?

128
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:33,628
-Good.
-Okay, I guess.

129
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,531
Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you, James?

130
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:41,606
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?

131
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:47,239
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.
Not for a while, remember?

132
00:16:47,414 --> 00:16:48,745
Why?

133
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:54,645
Look, I told you, I'm away
because I'm working, right?

134
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:57,788
Grandma says you're never coming back.

135
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,358
Phillipa, is that you?

136
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:03,660
Put Grandma on the phone for me,
will you?

137
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,525
She's shaking her head.

138
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:10,159
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.

139
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:12,232
Daddy?

140
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:13,963
Yeah, James?

141
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:15,802
Is Mommy with you?

142
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:20,640
James, we talked about this.

143
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:24,280
Mommy's not here anymore.

144
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:26,580
Where?

145
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:30,949
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.

146
00:17:31,124 --> 00:17:34,150
Listen, I'm gonna send some presents
with Grandpa, all right?

147
00:17:34,327 --> 00:17:35,351
And you be good, you be--

148
00:17:45,872 --> 00:17:48,067
-Our ride's on the roof.
-Right.

149
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:56,408
Hey, are you okay?

150
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,447
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

151
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:01,052
Well, down in the dream,
Mal showing up.

152
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:04,452
Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg.
Won't happen again.

153
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:08,219
-It's getting worse, isn't it?
-One apology's all you're getting, all right?

154
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:10,863
-Where's Nash?
-He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

155
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:13,499
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...

156
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,430
...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.

157
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:18,833
By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.

158
00:18:19,372 --> 00:18:21,863
-Where you gonna go?
-Buenos Aires.

159
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:26,308
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out
a job when things quiet down. You?

160
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,674
Stateside.

161
00:18:27,881 --> 00:18:29,371
Send my regards.

162
00:18:35,722 --> 00:18:39,283
He sold you out. Thought to come
to me and bargain for his life.

163
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:43,258
So I offer you the satisfaction.

164
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,725
It's not the way I deal with things.

165
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,882
-What will you do with him?
-Nothing.

166
00:19:05,285 --> 00:19:07,776
But I can't speak for
Cobol Engineering.

167
00:19:22,302 --> 00:19:25,294
-What do you want from us?
-Inception.

168
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:29,307
-Is it possible?
-Of course not.

169
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:31,671
If you can steal an idea
from someone's mind...

170
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:33,710
...why can't you plant
one there instead?

171
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,973
Okay, here's me planting
an idea in your head.

172
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:39,448
I say, "Don't think about elephants."
What are you thinking about?

173
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:40,643
Elephants.

174
00:19:40,821 --> 00:19:43,984
Right. But it's not your idea,
because you know I gave it to you.

175
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:47,160
The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea.

176
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,524
-True inspiration's impossible to fake.
-That's not true.

177
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,160
-Can you do it?
-Are you offering me a choice?

178
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:58,998
Because I can find my own way
to square things with Cobol.

179
00:19:59,172 --> 00:20:01,197
Then you do have a choice.

180
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,137
Then I choose to leave, sir.

181
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:09,743
Tell the crew where you want to go.

182
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:16,079
Hey, Mr. Cobb.

183
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,318
How would you like to go home?

184
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:25,427
To America. To your children.

185
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:29,199
You can't fix that. No one can.

186
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:32,600
-Just like inception.
-Cobb, come on.

187
00:20:36,343 --> 00:20:39,244
-How complex is the idea?
-Simple enough.

188
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:42,939
No idea is simple when you need
to plant it in somebody else's mind.

189
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,842
My main competitor is
an old man in poor health.

190
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,786
His son will soon inherit control
of the corporation.

191
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:55,252
I need him to decide to break up
his father's empire.

192
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:58,624
-Cobb, we should walk away from this.
-Hold on.

193
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,965
If I were to do this,
if I even could do it...

194
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,037
...I'd need a guarantee.

195
00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:09,471
-How do I know you can deliver?
-You don't.

196
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:11,543
But I can.

197
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:16,707
So do you want to take
a leap of faith...

198
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,984
...or become an old man,
filled with regret...

199
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,748
...waiting to die alone?

200
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:31,126
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.

201
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:41,070
Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.

202
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:45,606
This can't be done.

203
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:49,044
Yes, it can.
Just have to go deep enough.

204
00:21:49,249 --> 00:21:50,773
You don't know that.

205
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:53,949
I've done it before.

206
00:21:55,155 --> 00:21:56,315
Who'd you do it to?

207
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:03,552
Why are we going to Paris?

208
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:06,860
We're gonna need a new architect.

209
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:25,842
You never did like
your office, did you?

210
00:22:27,654 --> 00:22:30,680
No space to think
in that broom cupboard.

211
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,789
Is it safe for you to be here?

212
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:38,429
Extradition between France
and the United States...

213
00:22:38,598 --> 00:22:40,828
...is a bureaucratic nightmare,
you know that.

214
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:43,731
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

215
00:22:43,903 --> 00:22:48,397
Look, I, uh, brought these for you to
give to the kids when you have a chance.

216
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,169
It'll take more than
the occasional stuffed animal...

217
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:54,313
...to convince those children
they still have a father.

218
00:22:54,481 --> 00:22:57,314
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.

219
00:22:57,484 --> 00:22:59,008
I never taught you to be a thief.

220
00:22:59,185 --> 00:23:01,380
No, you taught me to navigate
people's minds.

221
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:02,851
But after what happened...

222
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:06,584
...there weren't a whole lot of
legitimate ways for me to use that skill.

223
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:13,221
What are you doing here, Dom?

224
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:17,735
I think I found a way home.

225
00:23:17,904 --> 00:23:21,465
It's a job
for some very, very powerful people.

226
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:26,111
People who I believe can fix
my charges permanently.

227
00:23:26,913 --> 00:23:28,175
But I need your help.

228
00:23:28,882 --> 00:23:32,181
You're here to corrupt
one of my brightest and best.

229
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,253
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.

230
00:23:35,422 --> 00:23:36,889
-Money.
-Not just money.

231
00:23:37,057 --> 00:23:38,388
You remember.

232
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,789
It's the chance to build cathedrals,
entire cities...

233
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:43,724
...things that never existed...

234
00:23:43,897 --> 00:23:47,094
...things that couldn't exist
in the real world.

235
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:52,432
So you want me to let someone else
follow you into your fantasy?

236
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:54,573
They don't actually
come into the dream.

237
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:58,006
They just design the levels and teach
them to the dreamers. That's all.

238
00:23:58,178 --> 00:23:59,406
Design it yourself.

239
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:03,572
Mal won't let me.

240
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:11,916
Come back to reality, Dom.

241
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:15,819
-Please.
-Reality.

242
00:24:16,196 --> 00:24:18,721
Those kids, your grandchildren...

243
00:24:18,898 --> 00:24:22,891
...they're waiting for their father to
come back home. That's their reality.

244
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:26,266
And this job, this last job,
that's how I get there.

245
00:24:26,806 --> 00:24:30,435
I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

246
00:24:33,613 --> 00:24:36,514
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

247
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,711
I've got somebody better.

248
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:43,913
Ariadne?

249
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,051
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

250
00:24:49,462 --> 00:24:50,554
Pleased to meet you.

251
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:55,394
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a
job offer he'd like to discuss with you.

252
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:56,592
A work placement?

253
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:58,300
Not exactly.

254
00:24:58,471 --> 00:24:59,802
I have a test for you.

255
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,599
You're not gonna tell
me anything first?

256
00:25:02,775 --> 00:25:05,403
Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.

257
00:25:05,578 --> 00:25:08,775
-Why?
-It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

258
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:16,549
You have two minutes to design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.

259
00:25:18,491 --> 00:25:19,617
Stop.

260
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:23,255
Again.

261
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,729
Stop.

262
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,962
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

263
00:25:44,984 --> 00:25:46,246
That's more like it.

264
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,340
They say we only use a fraction
of our brain's true potential.

265
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:11,204
Now, that's when we're awake.

266
00:26:11,377 --> 00:26:14,346
When we're asleep,
our mind can do almost anything.

267
00:26:14,514 --> 00:26:15,538
Such as?

268
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:19,708
Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.

269
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:23,720
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself, if you know what I mean.

270
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,858
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.

271
00:26:26,025 --> 00:26:28,289
Genuine inspiration, right?

272
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,794
Now, in a dream,
our mind continuously does this.

273
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:36,595
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

274
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:40,170
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.

275
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,070
That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.

276
00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:45,609
-How?
-By taking over the creating part.

277
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:47,405
Now, this is where I need you.

278
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,946
You create the world of the dream.

279
00:26:50,116 --> 00:26:55,486
We bring the subject into that dream, and
they fill it with their subconscious.

280
00:26:55,655 --> 00:27:00,319
How could I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?

281
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,951
Well, dreams, they feel real
while we're in them, right?

282
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,827
It's only when we wake up that we
realize something was actually strange.

283
00:27:09,302 --> 00:27:10,701
Let me ask you a question.

284
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:14,271
You never really remember
the beginning of a dream, do you?

285
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,466
You always wind up
right in the middle of what's going on.

286
00:27:17,644 --> 00:27:18,668
I guess, yeah.

287
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,403
So how did we end up here?

288
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:22,872
Well, we just came from the, uh...

289
00:27:23,082 --> 00:27:26,518
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?

290
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,020
Where are you right now?

291
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:33,485
We're dreaming?

292
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,094
You're in the middle
of the workshop, sleeping.

293
00:27:36,262 --> 00:27:39,231
This is your first lesson
in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

294
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,696
If it's just a dream,
then why are you--?

295
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,069
Because it's never just a dream, is it?

296
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:25,540
And a face full of glass hurts like
hell. When you're in it, it feels real.

297
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:27,907
That's why the military
developed dream sharing.

298
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,778
It was a training program for soldiers to
shoot, stab and strangle each other...

299
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:33,077
...and then wake up.

300
00:28:33,386 --> 00:28:35,183
How did architects become involved?

301
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:38,085
Well, someone had to design
the dreams, right?

302
00:28:39,225 --> 00:28:41,557
Why don't you give us
another five minutes?

303
00:28:41,728 --> 00:28:42,820
Five minutes?

304
00:28:44,197 --> 00:28:46,529
What--? We were talking
for, like, at least an hour.

305
00:28:46,699 --> 00:28:48,929
In a dream, your mind
functions more quickly...

306
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,935
...therefore time seems
to feel more slow.

307
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,472
Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.

308
00:28:56,209 --> 00:28:59,269
Why don't you see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

309
00:29:05,184 --> 00:29:08,119
You've got the basic layout.
Bookstore, café.

310
00:29:08,287 --> 00:29:09,948
Almost everything else is here too.

311
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,058
-Who are the people?
-Projections of my subconscious.

312
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:14,386
-Yours?
-Yes.

313
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,085
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.

314
00:29:17,263 --> 00:29:19,925
I am the subject. My mind populates it.

315
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:21,999
You can literally talk
to my subconscious.

316
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:25,069
That's one of the ways we extract
information from the subject.

317
00:29:25,238 --> 00:29:26,500
How else do you do it?

318
00:29:26,706 --> 00:29:30,665
By creating something secure,
like a bank vault or a jail.

319
00:29:30,843 --> 00:29:34,574
The mind automatically fills it with
information it's trying to protect.

320
00:29:34,747 --> 00:29:37,511
-You understand?
-Then you break in and steal it?

321
00:29:37,683 --> 00:29:38,707
Well...

322
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:43,379
I guess I thought that the dream space
would be all about the visual...

323
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:45,421
...but it's more about the feel of it.

324
00:29:45,892 --> 00:29:50,022
My question is what happens when you start
messing with the physics of it all?

325
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,928
It's something, isn't it?

326
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,337
Yes, it is.

327
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:00,789
Why are they all looking at me?

328
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:04,459
Because my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.

329
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:08,937
The more you change things, the quicker
the projections start to converge on you.

330
00:31:09,108 --> 00:31:10,166
Converge?

331
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:12,402
They sense the foreign nature
of the dreamer.

332
00:31:12,578 --> 00:31:15,240
They attack, like white blood cells
fighting an infection.

333
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:18,247
-What, they're gonna attack us?
-No, no.

334
00:31:18,818 --> 00:31:20,376
Just you.

335
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,556
This is great, but I'm telling you, if
you keep changing things like this...

336
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:35,033
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious
to take it easy?

337
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:37,863
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.

338
00:32:31,524 --> 00:32:32,889
Very impressive.

339
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:48,164
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?

340
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,673
Yeah, I cross it every day
to get to the college.

341
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:54,279
Never re-create places from your
memory. Always imagine new places.

342
00:32:54,447 --> 00:32:56,278
You draw from stuff you know, right?

343
00:32:56,449 --> 00:33:00,647
Only use details. A streetlamp
or a phone booth. Never entire areas.

344
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,947
-Why not?
-Building a dream from your memory...

345
00:33:03,122 --> 00:33:06,614
...is the easiest way to lose your grasp
on what's real and what is a dream.

346
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,851
-Is that what happened to you?
-Listen to me.

347
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,019
This has nothing to do
with me, understand?

348
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,165
That why you need me
to build your dreams?

349
00:33:13,332 --> 00:33:15,857
Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up.

350
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,662
-Cobb! Cobb!
-Get off of her!

351
00:33:17,837 --> 00:33:19,771
-Let me go! Let me go!
-Mal!

352
00:33:20,272 --> 00:33:22,365
-Mal!
-Cobb! Wake me up!

353
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:24,338
-Wake me up! Wake me up!
-No!

354
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,000
-Mal, no! No!
-Wake me up!

355
00:33:27,647 --> 00:33:31,606
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

356
00:33:31,784 --> 00:33:35,015
-Hey.
-Why wouldn't I wake up?

357
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:36,913
There was still time on the clock.

358
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:39,614
You can't wake up from
within the dream unless you die.

359
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:41,384
-She'll need a totem.
-What?

360
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,027
A totem, it's a small personal--

361
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:45,720
That's some subconscious
you've got on you, Cobb!

362
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,729
-She's a real charmer.
-Oh.

363
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,528
-I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
-She's his wife?

364
00:33:50,703 --> 00:33:54,434
Yeah. So a totem. You need
a small object, potentially heavy.

365
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:57,075
Something you can have on you
that no one else knows.

366
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,505
-Like a coin?
-No.

367
00:33:58,678 --> 00:34:03,308
It needs to be more unique than that.
Like, this is a loaded die.

368
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,318
No, I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

369
00:34:07,486 --> 00:34:11,684
See, only I know the balance and the
weight of this particular loaded die.

370
00:34:11,857 --> 00:34:13,688
That way,
when you look at your totem...

371
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:16,953
...you know beyond a doubt that
you're not in someone else's dream.

372
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,699
I don't know if you can't see what's going
on, or if you just don't want to...

373
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:28,397
...but Cobb has some serious problems
that he's tried to bury down there.

374
00:34:28,574 --> 00:34:32,510
And I'm not about to just open my mind
to someone like that.

375
00:34:38,651 --> 00:34:42,052
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone
pick it up that quickly before.

376
00:34:42,521 --> 00:34:46,719
Reality's not gonna be enough for
her now, and when she comes back...

377
00:34:47,393 --> 00:34:50,055
When she comes back,
you're gonna have her building mazes.

378
00:34:50,229 --> 00:34:52,493
-Where are you gonna be?
-I gotta go visit Eames.

379
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:55,793
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's back yard.

380
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,560
It's a necessary risk.

381
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,201
-Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
-We don't just need a thief.

382
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:03,365
We need a forger.

383
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:14,644
Rub them together all you want,
they're not gonna breed.

384
00:35:15,221 --> 00:35:16,245
You never know.

385
00:35:17,189 --> 00:35:19,214
I'm gonna get you a drink.

386
00:35:21,393 --> 00:35:22,758
You're buying.

387
00:35:29,235 --> 00:35:31,533
-Your spelling hasn't improved.
-Piss off.

388
00:35:31,704 --> 00:35:33,672
How's your handwriting?

389
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,670
-It's versatile.
-Good.

390
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:37,069
Thank you very much.

391
00:35:37,743 --> 00:35:39,108
Inception.

392
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,178
Now, before you bother telling me
it's impossible, let me--

393
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:45,647
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.

394
00:35:45,818 --> 00:35:49,083
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps
telling me it can't be done.

395
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,491
Hmm. Arthur. You still working
with that stick in the mud?

396
00:35:52,658 --> 00:35:54,353
He is good at what he does, right?

397
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,586
Oh, he's the best,
but he has no imagination.

398
00:35:56,762 --> 00:35:57,786
Not like you.

399
00:35:57,963 --> 00:36:00,932
Listen, if you're gonna perform
inception, you need imagination.

400
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,661
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

401
00:36:04,837 --> 00:36:08,466
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea
in place, but it didn't take.

402
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:11,974
-You didn't plant it deep enough?
-No, it's not just about depth.

403
00:36:12,144 --> 00:36:14,135
You need the simplest version
of the idea...

404
00:36:14,313 --> 00:36:17,976
...in order for it to grow naturally in
your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.

405
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,675
So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?

406
00:36:20,853 --> 00:36:25,051
We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

407
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,658
Right there you have
various political motivations...

408
00:36:27,827 --> 00:36:29,818
...and anti-monopolistic sentiments
and so forth.

409
00:36:29,995 --> 00:36:31,826
But all of that stuff, it's, um...

410
00:36:31,997 --> 00:36:34,864
It's really at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice, you see?

411
00:36:35,034 --> 00:36:37,525
What you have to do is
start at the absolute basic.

412
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:39,261
Which is what?

413
00:36:39,772 --> 00:36:41,672
The relationship with the father.

414
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:45,537
-Do you have a chemist?
-No, not yet.

415
00:36:45,711 --> 00:36:48,771
Right. Okay, well,
there's a man here, Yusuf.

416
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:52,384
He, uh, formulates his own versions
of the compounds.

417
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:53,848
Why don't you take me there?

418
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:57,079
Once you've lost your tail.
The man at the bar.

419
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,723
Cobol Engineering.

420
00:36:58,891 --> 00:37:01,223
That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?

421
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:03,918
Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.

422
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:07,725
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs
in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?

423
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,891
-Back here?
-This is the last place they'd suspect.

424
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,769
All right.

425
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,771
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.

426
00:37:16,942 --> 00:37:18,409
My God, it's you, isn't it?

427
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:23,005
No, it isn't you.

428
00:37:23,182 --> 00:37:24,615
Not dreaming now, are you?

429
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:28,411
Get him!

430
00:37:43,936 --> 00:37:45,062
There!

431
00:38:05,557 --> 00:38:07,320
One café.

432
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,824
Shh.

433
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,937
One café.

434
00:38:20,973 --> 00:38:22,440
One café.

435
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:18,496
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

436
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:24,195
-What are you doing in Mombasa?
-I'm here to protect my investment.

437
00:39:26,705 --> 00:39:29,640
Ah. So this is your idea
of losing a tail, huh?

438
00:39:29,808 --> 00:39:30,832
Different tail.

439
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:41,280
Cobb said you'd be back.

440
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,948
-I tried not to come, but...
-But there's nothing quite like it.

441
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,786
It's just...

442
00:39:49,294 --> 00:39:50,625
...pure creation.

443
00:39:50,796 --> 00:39:53,287
Shall we take a look
at some paradoxical architecture?

444
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:55,456
You're gonna have to master
a few tricks...

445
00:39:55,634 --> 00:39:59,161
...if you're gonna build three complete
dream levels. Excuse me.

446
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:00,771
What kind of tricks?

447
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:04,431
In a dream, you can cheat architecture
into impossible shapes.

448
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,512
That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps.

449
00:40:09,381 --> 00:40:11,372
The infinite staircase.

450
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:15,519
See?

451
00:40:19,691 --> 00:40:20,749
Paradox.

452
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:22,325
So a closed loop like that...

453
00:40:22,494 --> 00:40:25,588
...will help you disguise the
boundaries of the dream you create.

454
00:40:25,764 --> 00:40:27,732
But how big do these levels have to be?

455
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,028
It could be anything from the floor
of a building to an entire city.

456
00:40:31,203 --> 00:40:34,639
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

457
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,206
-A maze?
-Right, a maze.

458
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,706
And the better the maze...

459
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,572
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

460
00:40:40,746 --> 00:40:42,008
Exactly.

461
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:46,310
-My subconscious seems polite enough.
-Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.

462
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,386
No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.

463
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:51,648
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

464
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,323
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.

465
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,894
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the layouts.

466
00:40:58,063 --> 00:40:59,155
Why?

467
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,561
He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.

468
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,298
-His ex-wife?
-No, not his ex.

469
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:07,633
-They're still together?
-No.

470
00:41:08,874 --> 00:41:10,364
No, she's dead.

471
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:15,074
What you see in there
is just his projection of her.

472
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:20,084
What was she like in real life?

473
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:22,276
She was lovely.

474
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:28,357
-You are seeking a chemist?
-Yes.

475
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,654
To formulate compounds for a job?

476
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,195
And to go into the field with us.

477
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,595
No, I rarely go into
the field, Mr. Cobb.

478
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:39,498
Well, we'd need you there to tailor
compounds specific to our needs.

479
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:41,764
-Which are?
-Great depth.

480
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,205
A dream within a dream? Two levels?

481
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,004
Three.

482
00:41:49,181 --> 00:41:52,742
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

483
00:41:52,918 --> 00:41:56,877
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.

484
00:41:57,055 --> 00:41:59,717
A powerful sedative.

485
00:42:01,527 --> 00:42:03,757
-How many team members?
-Five.

486
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:05,658
Six.

487
00:42:06,532 --> 00:42:10,559
The only way to know you've done
the job is if I go in with you.

488
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,830
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

489
00:42:14,006 --> 00:42:16,372
This time, it seems there is.

490
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:21,040
This, I think, is a good place
to start. I use it every day.

491
00:42:21,213 --> 00:42:23,340
-What for?
-Here, I'll show you.

492
00:42:27,653 --> 00:42:29,382
Perhaps you will not want to see.

493
00:42:32,324 --> 00:42:33,916
After you.

494
00:42:43,235 --> 00:42:46,227
Ten. Twelve. All connected.
Bloody hell.

495
00:42:46,405 --> 00:42:48,168
They come every day to share the dream.

496
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,770
You see? Very stable.

497
00:42:59,484 --> 00:43:03,545
-How long do they dream for?
-Three, four hours, each day.

498
00:43:03,822 --> 00:43:04,846
In dream time?

499
00:43:05,023 --> 00:43:08,686
With this compound? About 40 hours,
each and every day.

500
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,159
-Why do they do it?
-Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

501
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:16,133
After a while, it becomes
the only way you can dream.

502
00:43:16,301 --> 00:43:18,235
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

503
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:22,271
-They come here every day to sleep?
-No.

504
00:43:24,009 --> 00:43:26,705
They come to be woken up.

505
00:43:27,713 --> 00:43:31,012
The dream has become their reality.

506
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,316
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?

507
00:43:36,622 --> 00:43:38,249
Let's see what you can do.

508
00:43:49,234 --> 00:43:50,826
You know how to find me.

509
00:43:53,438 --> 00:43:55,429
You know what you have to do.

510
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,737
Sharp, no?

511
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:20,162
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?

512
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:24,465
Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.

513
00:44:32,911 --> 00:44:36,608
Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer
Morrow energy conglomerate.

514
00:44:36,782 --> 00:44:38,682
What's your problem
with this Mr. Fischer?

515
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,442
That's not your concern.

516
00:44:40,852 --> 00:44:45,221
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.

517
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,982
You asked me for inception.

518
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:50,526
I do hope you understand
the gravity of that request.

519
00:44:50,696 --> 00:44:54,655
Now, the seed that we plant in this
man's mind will grow into an idea.

520
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,698
This idea will define him.

521
00:44:56,868 --> 00:44:58,699
It may come to change...

522
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,168
Well, it may come to change
everything about him.

523
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:05,674
We're the last company standing between
them and total energy dominance.

524
00:45:05,844 --> 00:45:07,903
And we can no longer compete.

525
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,538
Soon, they'll control the energy supply
of half the world.

526
00:45:11,717 --> 00:45:14,083
In effect, they become
a new superpower.

527
00:45:15,487 --> 00:45:18,820
The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

528
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,548
That's where we come in.

529
00:45:20,726 --> 00:45:23,991
How is Robert Fischer's relationship
with his father?

530
00:45:24,162 --> 00:45:26,892
Rumor is the relationship
is quite complicated.

531
00:45:27,065 --> 00:45:29,556
Well, we can't work based
solely on rumor, can we?

532
00:45:29,735 --> 00:45:32,932
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.

533
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:37,269
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.

534
00:45:37,442 --> 00:45:40,707
It should be possible,
if you can get the right references.

535
00:45:40,879 --> 00:45:45,339
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

536
00:45:45,984 --> 00:45:48,919
I'm not smelling
settlement here. Take them down.

537
00:45:49,087 --> 00:45:50,179
Mr. Browning...

538
00:45:50,355 --> 00:45:54,189
...Maurice Fischer's policy
is always one of avoiding litigation.

539
00:45:56,762 --> 00:46:01,222
Well, shall we voice your concerns
with Maurice directly?

540
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,799
Not sure that's necessary.

541
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,630
No, no, no. I think we should.

542
00:46:26,925 --> 00:46:28,483
How is he?

543
00:46:29,327 --> 00:46:32,091
I don't want to bother him
unnecessarily, but--

544
00:46:32,264 --> 00:46:37,725
Robert, I told you keep out
the damn--Wait. So do it. Get--

545
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:41,097
-Mr. Fischer.
-Put it through.

546
00:46:41,473 --> 00:46:45,068
Never, never.
Never do the same as I asked.

547
00:46:46,378 --> 00:46:48,039
Leave that.

548
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,115
Here.

549
00:46:55,387 --> 00:46:57,787
Must be a cherished memory of his.

550
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:03,418
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

551
00:47:03,595 --> 00:47:05,256
Robert...

552
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:10,032
...we need to talk about
a power of attorney.

553
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:13,501
-I know this is hard, but it's imperative--
-Not now, Uncle Peter.

554
00:47:17,509 --> 00:47:19,306
The vultures are circling.

555
00:47:19,478 --> 00:47:23,881
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

556
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,449
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

557
00:47:27,085 --> 00:47:31,454
...and adopt his physical presence, study
his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

558
00:47:31,623 --> 00:47:35,491
So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.

559
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,891
And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.

560
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,895
Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

561
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:44,558
...his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.

562
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,670
So he gives himself the idea.

563
00:47:46,838 --> 00:47:51,070
Precisely. That's the only way it will
stick. It has to seem self-generated.

564
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:54,644
Eames, I am impressed.

565
00:47:54,813 --> 00:47:58,374
Your condescension, as always,
is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

566
00:48:19,738 --> 00:48:21,729
Were you going under on your own?

567
00:48:21,907 --> 00:48:25,399
No, no, I was just, uh, running
some experiments.

568
00:48:25,577 --> 00:48:27,545
I didn't realize anyone was here, so...

569
00:48:27,712 --> 00:48:30,374
Yeah, I was just--
I was working on my totem, actually.

570
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:31,709
Here, let me take a look.

571
00:48:33,885 --> 00:48:35,182
So you're learning, huh?

572
00:48:35,353 --> 00:48:38,845
An elegant solution
for keeping track of reality.

573
00:48:39,491 --> 00:48:41,891
-Was it your idea?
-No, it was, uh...

574
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,186
It was Mal's, actually. This...

575
00:48:44,896 --> 00:48:48,662
This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.

576
00:48:48,867 --> 00:48:51,768
Just spin and spin.

577
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,239
Arthur told me she passed away.

578
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,201
How are the mazes coming along?

579
00:48:59,377 --> 00:49:02,278
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

580
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:03,914
...that we are trying to access.

581
00:49:04,082 --> 00:49:09,520
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital,
so Fischer will bring his father.

582
00:49:09,888 --> 00:49:12,652
You know, I--Actually, I have
a question about this layout.

583
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:17,557
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

584
00:49:17,729 --> 00:49:18,889
Why is that so important?

585
00:49:19,064 --> 00:49:21,055
In case one of us brings in
our projections.

586
00:49:21,232 --> 00:49:23,564
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

587
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:27,438
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

588
00:49:27,606 --> 00:49:30,006
You can't keep her out, can you?

589
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:32,433
-Right.
-You can't build...

590
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:35,910
...because if you know the maze,
then she knows it.

591
00:49:36,081 --> 00:49:38,276
Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.

592
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:41,248
-Cobb, do the others know?
-No. No, they don't.

593
00:49:41,419 --> 00:49:43,649
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

594
00:49:43,822 --> 00:49:45,756
No one said it's getting worse.

595
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:50,257
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.

596
00:49:51,129 --> 00:49:53,188
Why can't you go home?

597
00:49:56,301 --> 00:49:58,326
Because they think I killed her.

598
00:50:01,573 --> 00:50:03,837
-Thank you.
-For what?

599
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,306
For not asking whether I did.

600
00:50:06,478 --> 00:50:08,639
"I will split up my father's empire."

601
00:50:08,813 --> 00:50:13,011
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

602
00:50:13,184 --> 00:50:15,982
...which is why we need to plant
it deep in his subconscious.

603
00:50:16,154 --> 00:50:19,681
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

604
00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:23,624
We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.

605
00:50:23,795 --> 00:50:26,229
How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?

606
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:29,993
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...

607
00:50:30,168 --> 00:50:32,898
-...is stressed, to say the least.
-Can we run with that?

608
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:36,666
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

609
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:40,299
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

610
00:50:40,712 --> 00:50:44,409
We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

611
00:50:44,582 --> 00:50:48,348
We need Robert Fischer to have a
positive emotional reaction to all this.

612
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,351
All right, well, try this. Um...

613
00:50:50,522 --> 00:50:55,255
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps."

614
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,718
That might work.

615
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:00,058
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might."

616
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:02,199
Thank you for your
contribution, Arthur.

617
00:51:02,367 --> 00:51:05,302
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.

618
00:51:05,503 --> 00:51:06,595
Specificity?

619
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:08,602
Inception's not about being specific.

620
00:51:08,773 --> 00:51:12,732
When we get inside his mind, we're
gonna have to work with what we find.

621
00:51:14,045 --> 00:51:17,037
On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father...

622
00:51:17,215 --> 00:51:20,275
...and say, "I will not follow
in my father's footsteps."

623
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:25,116
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."

624
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,623
Then, by the time we hit the bottom
level, we bring out the big guns.

625
00:51:28,793 --> 00:51:31,193
-"My father doesn't want me to be him."
-Exactly.

626
00:51:32,564 --> 00:51:36,557
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna
collapse with the slightest disturbance.

627
00:51:36,735 --> 00:51:37,895
Sedation.

628
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:40,902
For sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming...

629
00:51:41,072 --> 00:51:44,974
...we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.

630
00:51:56,421 --> 00:51:57,479
Good night.

631
00:51:58,089 --> 00:52:00,284
The compound we'll be using
to share the dream...

632
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:02,392
...creates a clear connection
between dreamers...

633
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,792
-...whilst accelerating brain function.
-In other words, more time on each level.

634
00:52:06,965 --> 00:52:10,128
Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.

635
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:13,793
And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.

636
00:52:13,972 --> 00:52:16,065
It's three dreams,
that's 10 hours times 20--

637
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:19,142
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?

638
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:21,972
It's a week, the first level down.

639
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,513
Six months the second level down,
and the third level--

640
00:52:25,683 --> 00:52:27,116
That's 10 years.

641
00:52:29,754 --> 00:52:31,915
Who'd wanna be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?

642
00:52:32,323 --> 00:52:33,483
Depends on the dream.

643
00:52:33,658 --> 00:52:35,956
So once we've made the plant,
how do we get out?

644
00:52:36,127 --> 00:52:39,460
I'm hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting me in the head.

645
00:52:39,631 --> 00:52:42,395
-A kick.
-What's a kick?

646
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:45,263
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

647
00:52:47,405 --> 00:52:50,101
It's that feeling of falling you get
that jolts you awake.

648
00:52:50,275 --> 00:52:53,506
-Snaps you out of the dream.
-We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?

649
00:52:53,678 --> 00:52:54,872
That's the clever part.

650
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:58,277
I customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

651
00:52:58,449 --> 00:53:03,284
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

652
00:53:03,454 --> 00:53:05,820
Or tipping.

653
00:53:06,457 --> 00:53:10,621
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.

654
00:53:11,162 --> 00:53:14,689
We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

655
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:26,066
He hasn't got any surgery
scheduled, no dental, nothing.

656
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,235
Wasn't he supposed to have
a knee operation?

657
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,644
Nothing. Nothing that they'll put him
under for, anyway. And we need--

658
00:53:31,816 --> 00:53:33,750
We need at least a good 10 hours.

659
00:53:33,918 --> 00:53:35,249
Sydney to Los Angeles.

660
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:40,854
One of the longest flights in the
world. He makes it every two weeks.

661
00:53:41,025 --> 00:53:43,186
He must be flying private, then.

662
00:53:43,695 --> 00:53:46,858
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.

663
00:53:47,031 --> 00:53:49,261
-It would have to be a 747.
-Why's that?

664
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,901
On a 747, the pilot's up top...

665
00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:54,266
...the first-class cabin's in the nose,
so no one would walk through.

666
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:57,931
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first-class flight attendant.

667
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,667
I bought the airline.

668
00:54:01,246 --> 00:54:03,043
It seemed neater.

669
00:54:04,649 --> 00:54:07,447
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.

670
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,247
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.

671
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:01,431
You know how to find me.

672
00:55:02,907 --> 00:55:04,340
You know what you have to do.

673
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:11,637
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

674
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,542
Of course I do.

675
00:55:15,653 --> 00:55:18,144
You said you had a dream.

676
00:55:21,092 --> 00:55:23,856
That we'd grow old together.

677
00:55:25,296 --> 00:55:26,991
And we can.

678
00:55:33,671 --> 00:55:35,605
You shouldn't be here.

679
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,835
Just wanted to see what kind of tests
you're doing on your own every night.

680
00:55:43,014 --> 00:55:46,211
-This has nothing to do with you.
-This has everything to do with me.

681
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:52,186
-You've asked me to share dreams with you.
-Not these. These are my dreams.

682
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:05,467
Why do you do this to yourself?

683
00:56:05,636 --> 00:56:08,571
It's the only way I can still dream.

684
00:56:10,341 --> 00:56:12,536
Why is it so important to dream?

685
00:56:13,444 --> 00:56:15,708
In my dreams, we're still together.

686
00:56:30,061 --> 00:56:31,790
These aren't just dreams.

687
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,624
These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.

688
00:56:36,801 --> 00:56:37,859
I know I did.

689
00:56:38,503 --> 00:56:43,031
You're trying to keep her alive.
You can't let her go.

690
00:56:43,207 --> 00:56:46,199
You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.

691
00:56:46,377 --> 00:56:48,937
They're memories that I have to change.

692
00:56:50,181 --> 00:56:52,649
Well, what's down there
that you regret?

693
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:56,179
Listen, there's only one thing
you need to understand about me.

694
00:57:04,662 --> 00:57:06,254
This is your house?

695
00:57:06,931 --> 00:57:09,399
Mine and Mal's, yes.

696
00:57:09,567 --> 00:57:11,262
Where is she?

697
00:57:11,936 --> 00:57:13,927
She's already gone.

698
00:57:18,676 --> 00:57:20,200
That's my son, James.

699
00:57:20,378 --> 00:57:23,472
He's digging for something,
maybe a worm.

700
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:25,975
That's Phillipa.

701
00:57:26,517 --> 00:57:28,382
I thought about calling out to them...

702
00:57:28,553 --> 00:57:31,317
...so they'd turn and smile
and I could see...

703
00:57:32,023 --> 00:57:37,154
...those beautiful faces of theirs,
but it's all too late.

704
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:40,161
Right now or never, Cobb.

705
00:57:44,635 --> 00:57:46,432
Then I start to panic.

706
00:57:46,604 --> 00:57:49,300
I realize I'm gonna
regret this moment...

707
00:57:50,141 --> 00:57:52,473
...that I need to see their faces
one last time.

708
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:55,134
James! Phillipa! Come on in!

709
00:57:55,313 --> 00:57:57,338
But the moment's past.

710
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:02,917
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.

711
00:58:03,821 --> 00:58:05,982
As I'm about to call out to them...

712
00:58:07,024 --> 00:58:08,116
...they run away.

713
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:14,127
If I'm ever gonna see their faces
again, I've gotta get back home.

714
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:16,656
The real world.

715
00:58:58,242 --> 00:58:59,709
What are you doing here?

716
00:59:00,545 --> 00:59:01,637
My name is--

717
00:59:01,812 --> 00:59:05,111
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

718
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:15,725
I'm just trying to understand.

719
00:59:15,893 --> 00:59:18,020
How could you understand?

720
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:21,357
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

721
00:59:23,367 --> 00:59:25,494
To be half of a whole?

722
00:59:26,737 --> 00:59:28,295
No.

723
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,765
I'll tell you a riddle.

724
00:59:33,244 --> 00:59:35,542
You're waiting for a train.

725
00:59:36,581 --> 00:59:39,744
A train that will take you far away.

726
00:59:41,118 --> 00:59:44,087
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

727
00:59:45,122 --> 00:59:47,386
...but you don't know for sure.

728
00:59:47,558 --> 00:59:49,458
But it doesn't matter.

729
00:59:50,428 --> 00:59:53,829
How can it not matter to you
where that train will take you?

730
00:59:53,998 --> 00:59:55,761
Because you'll be together.

731
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,895
-How could you bring her here, Dom?
-What is this place?

732
01:00:00,304 --> 01:00:03,467
This is a hotel suite where we
used to spend our anniversary.

733
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:04,972
What happened here?

734
01:00:06,877 --> 01:00:09,710
You promised!
You promised we'd be together!

735
01:00:10,147 --> 01:00:12,206
Please, I need you to stay here
just for now!

736
01:00:12,383 --> 01:00:15,614
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow old together!

737
01:00:15,786 --> 01:00:18,254
I'll come back for you. I promise.

738
01:00:36,474 --> 01:00:41,844
Do you think you can just build
a prison of memories to lock her in?

739
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,846
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

740
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,012
It's time.

741
01:00:48,252 --> 01:00:50,584
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

742
01:00:50,755 --> 01:00:52,916
-When's the funeral?
-Thursday. In Los Angeles.

743
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:56,355
Robert should accompany the body
no later than Tuesday. We should move.

744
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:57,994
All right.

745
01:00:58,596 --> 01:01:01,622
-Cobb, I'm coming with you.
-I promised Miles. No.

746
01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:04,927
The team needs someone who understands
what you're struggling with.

747
01:01:07,505 --> 01:01:09,666
And it doesn't have to be me...

748
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,139
...but then you have to show Arthur
what I just saw.

749
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:20,611
Get us another seat on the plane.

750
01:01:24,689 --> 01:01:27,715
If I get on this plane
and you don't honor our agreement...

751
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:31,555
...when we land,
I go to jail for the rest of my life.

752
01:01:32,229 --> 01:01:34,424
Complete the job en route...

753
01:01:34,598 --> 01:01:37,066
...I make one phone
call from the plane...

754
01:01:37,234 --> 01:01:40,135
...you have no trouble
getting through Immigration.

755
01:01:53,884 --> 01:01:56,375
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, yeah, absolutely.

756
01:01:56,554 --> 01:01:58,112
Thank you.

757
01:02:31,722 --> 01:02:35,021
Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.

758
01:02:35,192 --> 01:02:37,092
Would you care for a drink?

759
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:38,558
Oh. Water, please.

760
01:02:38,729 --> 01:02:41,027
Oh, um, same, please.

761
01:02:41,999 --> 01:02:43,296
Um...

762
01:02:44,034 --> 01:02:45,126
Thank you.

763
01:02:45,302 --> 01:02:47,167
You know, I couldn't help but notice...

764
01:02:47,338 --> 01:02:50,933
...but you wouldn't happen to be related
to the Maurice Fischer, would you?

765
01:02:51,108 --> 01:02:52,598
Yes, he, um...

766
01:02:53,544 --> 01:02:55,535
He was my father.

767
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:00,007
Well, he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your loss.

768
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,648
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

769
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,153
Hey.

770
01:03:06,557 --> 01:03:08,184
To your father.

771
01:03:08,793 --> 01:03:11,023
May he rest in peace, huh?

772
01:04:19,497 --> 01:04:21,795
-Couldn't have peed before you went under?
-Sorry.

773
01:04:21,966 --> 01:04:24,025
Bit too much free champagne
before takeoff?

774
01:04:24,201 --> 01:04:25,293
Ha, ha, bloody ha.

775
01:04:25,469 --> 01:04:28,438
We know he's gonna be looking
for a taxi in this weather.

776
01:04:40,117 --> 01:04:44,144
-Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try--?
-Walk away.

777
01:05:00,037 --> 01:05:01,436
Just have him ca--I gotta go.

778
01:05:01,605 --> 01:05:03,732
All right. Taxi. Thank you.

779
01:05:06,677 --> 01:05:09,544
All right, Third and Market. Snappy.

780
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:12,446
-What are you doing?
-Sorry, I thought it was free.

781
01:05:12,616 --> 01:05:14,106
-It's not.
-Maybe we could share.

782
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:17,118
Maybe not.
Can you pull over and get this--?

783
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,421
Great.

784
01:05:26,363 --> 01:05:27,830
Come on.

785
01:05:38,943 --> 01:05:41,571
There's $500 in there.
The wallet's worth more than that.

786
01:05:41,745 --> 01:05:43,440
You might at least
drop me at my stop.

787
01:05:43,614 --> 01:05:44,706
I'm afraid that it doesn't--

788
01:05:54,425 --> 01:05:56,222
-Cover him!
-Down! Down now!

789
01:05:56,393 --> 01:05:58,020
What the hell is going on?

790
01:06:01,765 --> 01:06:03,995
This wasn't in the design.

791
01:06:04,935 --> 01:06:06,300
Cobb?

792
01:06:06,537 --> 01:06:07,561
Cobb?

793
01:06:58,489 --> 01:06:59,683
Get him!

794
01:07:06,363 --> 01:07:07,796
Are you all right?

795
01:07:07,998 --> 01:07:10,159
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

796
01:07:10,334 --> 01:07:12,234
Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.

797
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:13,631
Saito?

798
01:07:32,556 --> 01:07:34,683
Get Fischer in the back room now.

799
01:07:34,992 --> 01:07:37,688
-Get him in the back room. Move.
-What the hell happened?

800
01:07:38,128 --> 01:07:39,595
Has he been shot? Is he dying?

801
01:07:39,763 --> 01:07:41,492
-I don't know.
-Jesus Christ.

802
01:07:41,665 --> 01:07:44,099
-What happened to you?
-Blocked by a freight train.

803
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:46,236
Why put a train
in a downtown intersection?

804
01:07:46,403 --> 01:07:47,995
-I didn't.
-Where'd it come from?

805
01:07:48,172 --> 01:07:49,833
Why the hell were we ambushed?

806
01:07:50,007 --> 01:07:53,408
Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.

807
01:07:53,577 --> 01:07:56,137
-How could he be trained?
-Fischer's had an extractor...

808
01:07:56,313 --> 01:08:00,511
...teach his subconscious to defend itself,
so his subconscious is militarized.

809
01:08:00,684 --> 01:08:02,311
It should've shown in the research.

810
01:08:02,486 --> 01:08:04,283
-Why the hell didn't it?
-Calm down.

811
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:05,786
Don't tell me to calm down!

812
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:08,891
This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!

813
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:11,118
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!

814
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:14,628
-We are not prepared for this!
-We have dealt with sub-security before!

815
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:16,891
We'll be more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

816
01:08:17,067 --> 01:08:18,864
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.

817
01:08:19,036 --> 01:08:20,094
Put him out his misery.

818
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:23,103
-No, don't do that! Don't do that.
-Cobb, hey, hey.

819
01:08:23,273 --> 01:08:25,366
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.

820
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:27,442
No. It won't wake him up.

821
01:08:27,611 --> 01:08:31,206
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.

822
01:08:31,381 --> 01:08:32,643
Not from this.

823
01:08:32,816 --> 01:08:35,341
We're too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.

824
01:08:35,953 --> 01:08:37,648
Right. So, what happens when we die?

825
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:39,652
-We drop into limbo.
-Are you serious?

826
01:08:39,823 --> 01:08:42,348
-Limbo?
-Unconstructed dream space.

827
01:08:42,526 --> 01:08:45,791
-Well, what the hell is down there?
-Just raw, infinite subconscious.

828
01:08:45,963 --> 01:08:49,160
Nothing is down there, except for
what might have been left behind...

829
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:52,234
...by anyone sharing the dream
who's been trapped there before.

830
01:08:52,402 --> 01:08:54,302
Which, in our case, is just you.

831
01:08:54,471 --> 01:08:57,167
-How long could we be stuck?
-Can't even think about...

832
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:59,741
-...trying to escape until the sedation--
-How long?

833
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:03,141
Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.

834
01:09:03,313 --> 01:09:04,507
Let's get him upstairs.

835
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:07,583
Great.

836
01:09:08,585 --> 01:09:10,052
Thank you.

837
01:09:10,754 --> 01:09:13,985
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind,
battling his own private army.

838
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:15,625
And if we get killed...

839
01:09:15,793 --> 01:09:19,024
...we'll be lost in limbo till our
brains turn to scrambled egg, hmm?

840
01:09:25,936 --> 01:09:27,767
Someone got first aid?

841
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,498
-You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
-There weren't meant to be risks.

842
01:09:33,677 --> 01:09:36,612
-I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
-You had no right.

843
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:39,112
This was the only way
to go three layers deep.

844
01:09:39,283 --> 01:09:41,308
You knew about this
and went along with it?

845
01:09:41,485 --> 01:09:42,509
I trusted him.

846
01:09:42,686 --> 01:09:44,586
When? When he promised you
half his share?

847
01:09:44,755 --> 01:09:48,020
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.

848
01:09:48,192 --> 01:09:50,251
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?

849
01:09:50,427 --> 01:09:53,863
That has nothing to do with it. I did
what I had to to get to my children.

850
01:09:54,031 --> 01:09:55,931
You led us into a war zone
with no way out?

851
01:09:56,099 --> 01:10:00,126
There is a way out. We continue on with the
job, and we do it as fast as possible...

852
01:10:00,304 --> 01:10:02,636
...and we get out using the kick,
just like before.

853
01:10:02,806 --> 01:10:05,274
Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the stakes.

854
01:10:05,442 --> 01:10:07,307
I am sitting this one
out on this level.

855
01:10:07,477 --> 01:10:09,911
Fischer's security
is surrounding this place.

856
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,344
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

857
01:10:12,516 --> 01:10:16,247
That means each and every one of us will
be killed. That I can guarantee you.

858
01:10:16,854 --> 01:10:20,620
We have no other choice but to continue
on and do it as fast as possible.

859
01:10:22,226 --> 01:10:24,660
Downwards is the only way forwards.

860
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:27,356
Get ready.

861
01:10:27,531 --> 01:10:29,726
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.

862
01:10:34,571 --> 01:10:37,597
I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to 10 million.

863
01:10:37,774 --> 01:10:40,709
-This should be very simple.
-Shut up! It won't be.

864
01:10:40,878 --> 01:10:43,142
In your father's office,
below the bookshelves...

865
01:10:43,313 --> 01:10:45,372
...is his personal safe.
We need the combination.

866
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:48,149
I don't know any safe.

867
01:10:48,352 --> 01:10:51,219
That doesn't mean
you don't know the combination.

868
01:10:52,856 --> 01:10:54,187
Tell us what it is.

869
01:10:55,058 --> 01:10:56,787
I don't know.

870
01:11:01,732 --> 01:11:03,859
We have it on good authority
you do know.

871
01:11:04,034 --> 01:11:06,366
Yeah? Whose authority?

872
01:11:07,871 --> 01:11:11,363
-Five hundred dollars, this cost.
-What's inside it?

873
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:15,408
Cash, cards, ID. And this.

874
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:21,940
Useful?

875
01:11:22,686 --> 01:11:23,710
Maybe.

876
01:11:24,187 --> 01:11:25,984
You're on. You've got an hour.

877
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:27,414
An hour?

878
01:11:28,725 --> 01:11:30,989
I was supposed to have all night
to crack this.

879
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:33,755
And Saito wasn't supposed
to be shot in the chest.

880
01:11:33,931 --> 01:11:37,094
You've got one hour,
now get us something useful, please.

881
01:11:39,636 --> 01:11:42,070
-What's that?
-Good authority.

882
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:48,005
Uncle Peter.

883
01:11:48,712 --> 01:11:50,839
Just make them stop.

884
01:11:51,148 --> 01:11:53,280
-The combination.
-I don't know it.

885
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:56,092
-Why does Browning say you do?
-I don't know.

886
01:11:56,266 --> 01:11:58,734
Just let me talk to him
and I'll find out.

887
01:12:01,105 --> 01:12:03,801
You have one hour. Start talking.

888
01:12:05,809 --> 01:12:07,003
You all right?

889
01:12:08,912 --> 01:12:10,209
You okay?

890
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:17,580
Those bastards have had at me
for two days.

891
01:12:18,255 --> 01:12:20,723
They have someone with access
to your father's office.

892
01:12:20,891 --> 01:12:22,756
-They're trying to open his safe.
-Yeah.

893
01:12:22,926 --> 01:12:25,656
They thought I'd know the combination,
but I don't know it.

894
01:12:25,829 --> 01:12:28,559
-Yeah, well, neither do I, so...
-What?

895
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:32,564
Maurice told me that when he passed,
you were the only one able to open it.

896
01:12:32,736 --> 01:12:35,261
No, he never gave me any combination.

897
01:12:36,006 --> 01:12:40,136
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.

898
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:41,504
Well, what, then?

899
01:12:41,678 --> 01:12:44,203
I don't know, some meaningful
combination of numbers...

900
01:12:44,381 --> 01:12:48,317
...based on your experiences
with Maurice.

901
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:53,956
We didn't have very many, uh,
meaningful experiences together.

902
01:12:54,691 --> 01:12:56,158
Perhaps after your mother died.

903
01:12:58,829 --> 01:13:00,956
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

904
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,400
"Robert,
there's really nothing to be said."

905
01:13:08,578 --> 01:13:10,910
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

906
01:13:11,081 --> 01:13:13,777
I was 11, Uncle Peter.

907
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:17,782
-How's he doing?
-He's in a lot of pain.

908
01:13:17,954 --> 01:13:21,549
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

909
01:13:21,725 --> 01:13:22,953
And if he dies?

910
01:13:24,127 --> 01:13:25,594
Worst-case scenario?

911
01:13:25,762 --> 01:13:28,458
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

912
01:13:28,632 --> 01:13:32,693
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.

913
01:13:32,869 --> 01:13:34,564
I appreciate that, Saito.

914
01:13:34,738 --> 01:13:38,799
But when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

915
01:13:38,975 --> 01:13:41,000
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

916
01:13:41,178 --> 01:13:44,944
You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.

917
01:13:45,415 --> 01:13:46,746
Filled with regret?

918
01:13:48,185 --> 01:13:49,277
Waiting to die alone.

919
01:13:49,953 --> 01:13:51,045
No.

920
01:13:51,621 --> 01:13:53,248
I'll come back.

921
01:13:54,057 --> 01:13:56,719
And we'll be young men together again.

922
01:14:02,699 --> 01:14:03,757
Breathe.

923
01:14:03,934 --> 01:14:06,960
These people are gonna kill us
if we don't give them the combination.

924
01:14:07,137 --> 01:14:09,037
-They just wanna ransom us.
-I heard them.

925
01:14:09,206 --> 01:14:13,108
They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

926
01:14:13,276 --> 01:14:14,743
All right. What is in the safe?

927
01:14:15,846 --> 01:14:17,006
Something for you.

928
01:14:17,647 --> 01:14:21,777
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

929
01:14:22,519 --> 01:14:25,579
-A will.
-Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

930
01:14:25,756 --> 01:14:26,984
That's an alternate.

931
01:14:27,157 --> 01:14:29,523
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

932
01:14:29,693 --> 01:14:32,321
It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

933
01:14:32,496 --> 01:14:36,193
It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

934
01:14:36,366 --> 01:14:38,834
Destroying my whole inheritance?

935
01:14:40,504 --> 01:14:43,667
-Why would he suggest such a thing?
-I just don't know.

936
01:14:46,543 --> 01:14:48,511
He loved you, Robert.

937
01:14:49,079 --> 01:14:50,706
In his own way.

938
01:14:50,881 --> 01:14:52,678
In his own way.

939
01:14:53,984 --> 01:14:55,508
At the end...

940
01:14:56,653 --> 01:14:58,985
...he called me in to his deathbed.

941
01:14:59,489 --> 01:15:01,320
He could barely speak.

942
01:15:02,392 --> 01:15:06,624
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

943
01:15:09,132 --> 01:15:10,759
He pulled me close.

944
01:15:13,437 --> 01:15:15,530
And I could only make out...

945
01:15:16,406 --> 01:15:17,839
...one word.

946
01:15:21,545 --> 01:15:23,513
"Disappointed."

947
01:15:29,152 --> 01:15:30,346
When were you in limbo?

948
01:15:31,922 --> 01:15:35,414
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

949
01:15:35,592 --> 01:15:37,958
-But they don't know the truth.
-Truth? What truth?

950
01:15:38,161 --> 01:15:42,291
The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

951
01:15:42,466 --> 01:15:46,527
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

952
01:15:46,703 --> 01:15:49,103
And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...

953
01:15:49,272 --> 01:15:51,069
...we're also going deeper into you.

954
01:15:51,908 --> 01:15:55,173
And I'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find.

955
01:15:59,182 --> 01:16:00,649
We were working together.

956
01:16:00,817 --> 01:16:04,480
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

957
01:16:04,688 --> 01:16:05,950
I kept pushing things.

958
01:16:06,122 --> 01:16:09,785
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.

959
01:16:10,293 --> 01:16:15,162
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

960
01:16:15,332 --> 01:16:18,062
...that we could get trapped so deep...

961
01:16:18,902 --> 01:16:22,201
...that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

962
01:16:22,806 --> 01:16:25,331
...we lost sight of what was real.

963
01:16:31,414 --> 01:16:33,974
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

964
01:16:35,619 --> 01:16:37,610
We did that for years.

965
01:16:38,755 --> 01:16:40,723
We built our own world.

966
01:16:42,092 --> 01:16:43,787
How long were you stuck there?

967
01:16:44,961 --> 01:16:47,054
Something like 50 years.

968
01:16:50,467 --> 01:16:51,627
Jesus.

969
01:16:53,937 --> 01:16:55,268
How could you stand it?

970
01:16:55,438 --> 01:16:58,168
It wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.

971
01:16:58,341 --> 01:17:01,367
The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.

972
01:17:01,545 --> 01:17:05,948
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

973
01:17:06,116 --> 01:17:07,515
And what about for her?

974
01:17:10,987 --> 01:17:14,889
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

975
01:17:16,293 --> 01:17:21,526
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

976
01:17:24,467 --> 01:17:26,958
Limbo became her reality.

977
01:17:28,305 --> 01:17:30,102
What happened when you woke up?

978
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,303
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

979
01:17:35,378 --> 01:17:39,872
...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?

980
01:17:40,784 --> 01:17:44,550
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

981
01:17:45,922 --> 01:17:48,186
Eventually, she told me the truth.

982
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:51,992
She was possessed by an idea.

983
01:17:52,162 --> 01:17:57,862
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

984
01:17:59,002 --> 01:18:01,470
That our world wasn't real.

985
01:18:02,405 --> 01:18:06,671
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

986
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:09,576
...that in order to get back home...

987
01:18:10,814 --> 01:18:12,611
...we had to kill ourselves.

988
01:18:19,255 --> 01:18:22,713
-What about your children?
-She thought they were projections...

989
01:18:22,892 --> 01:18:25,884
...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

990
01:18:26,062 --> 01:18:27,757
-I'm their mother!
-Calm down.

991
01:18:27,931 --> 01:18:29,193
I can tell the difference.

992
01:18:29,366 --> 01:18:31,698
If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?

993
01:18:31,868 --> 01:18:33,563
You don't know you're dreaming!

994
01:18:33,737 --> 01:18:35,932
She was certain
there was nothing I could do...

995
01:18:36,106 --> 01:18:39,940
...no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

996
01:18:42,912 --> 01:18:45,938
She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

997
01:18:46,116 --> 01:18:52,612
She loved me too much, so she came up
with a plan on our anniversary.

998
01:19:18,682 --> 01:19:21,480
-Sweetheart, what are you doing?
-Join me.

999
01:19:21,651 --> 01:19:25,917
Just--Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.

1000
01:19:26,089 --> 01:19:30,526
No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

1001
01:19:30,694 --> 01:19:32,389
No, I'm not.

1002
01:19:32,562 --> 01:19:34,655
Now, you listen to me.

1003
01:19:35,265 --> 01:19:39,497
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.

1004
01:19:39,669 --> 01:19:41,603
Now, just step back inside.

1005
01:19:41,771 --> 01:19:44,501
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1006
01:19:44,674 --> 01:19:46,608
We've talked enough.

1007
01:19:48,678 --> 01:19:50,339
-Mal.
-Come out onto the ledge...

1008
01:19:50,513 --> 01:19:53,209
-...or I'll jump right now.
-Okay.

1009
01:19:57,487 --> 01:19:59,284
We're gonna talk about this.

1010
01:20:00,156 --> 01:20:01,316
All right?

1011
01:20:01,491 --> 01:20:06,554
-I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
-No, honey.

1012
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:10,522
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.

1013
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:13,464
Take a second, think
about our children.

1014
01:20:13,636 --> 01:20:15,365
Think about James.

1015
01:20:16,106 --> 01:20:17,733
Think about Phillipa, now.

1016
01:20:17,907 --> 01:20:20,842
If I go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.

1017
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:24,309
-What does that mean?
-I filed a letter with our attorney...

1018
01:20:24,748 --> 01:20:28,081
...explaining how I'm fearful
for my safety.

1019
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,447
How you've threatened to kill me.

1020
01:20:35,258 --> 01:20:37,886
-Why did you do this?
-I love you, Dom.

1021
01:20:38,061 --> 01:20:39,824
Why did--? Why would you do this to me?

1022
01:20:39,996 --> 01:20:42,863
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1023
01:20:43,032 --> 01:20:46,058
We're going home to our real children.

1024
01:20:46,236 --> 01:20:49,865
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

1025
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:51,336
You're waiting for a train.

1026
01:20:51,841 --> 01:20:55,402
-Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
-A train that will take you far away.

1027
01:20:55,578 --> 01:20:57,569
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1028
01:20:57,747 --> 01:21:01,581
You know where you hope this train will
take you, but you can't know for sure.

1029
01:21:01,751 --> 01:21:03,946
-Mal, look at me!
-But it doesn't matter.

1030
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:07,317
-Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
-Because you'll be together.

1031
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:11,324
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

1032
01:21:11,494 --> 01:21:12,927
Jesus Christ!

1033
01:21:16,432 --> 01:21:20,163
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1034
01:21:20,336 --> 01:21:24,534
It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

1035
01:21:24,707 --> 01:21:25,935
So I ran.

1036
01:21:27,777 --> 01:21:30,007
Right now, or never, Cobb.

1037
01:21:36,386 --> 01:21:41,016
James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!

1038
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:42,349
All right, let's go.

1039
01:21:42,892 --> 01:21:46,692
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

1040
01:21:47,263 --> 01:21:51,131
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

1041
01:21:51,301 --> 01:21:54,600
But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.

1042
01:21:55,839 --> 01:21:58,399
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

1043
01:21:58,575 --> 01:22:03,535
...you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her.

1044
01:22:03,713 --> 01:22:05,544
But you don't have to do that alone.

1045
01:22:05,715 --> 01:22:07,979
-No, you're not...
-I'm doing it for the others.

1046
01:22:08,651 --> 01:22:13,748
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

1047
01:22:18,828 --> 01:22:20,318
We have to move.

1048
01:22:20,496 --> 01:22:21,929
Time's up.

1049
01:22:22,098 --> 01:22:24,828
All right. I don't
know any combination.

1050
01:22:25,001 --> 01:22:28,095
-Not consciously, anyway.
-How about instinctively, huh?

1051
01:22:28,271 --> 01:22:32,207
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

1052
01:22:32,375 --> 01:22:35,276
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1053
01:22:35,445 --> 01:22:37,675
-I have no idea.
-Right now!

1054
01:22:37,847 --> 01:22:40,077
I said, right now! Right now!

1055
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:44,152
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

1056
01:22:48,024 --> 01:22:50,015
You'll have to do better than that.

1057
01:22:50,193 --> 01:22:53,526
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.

1058
01:22:57,901 --> 01:23:02,031
We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?

1059
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:08,800
What'd you get?

1060
01:23:09,212 --> 01:23:11,737
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

1061
01:23:11,915 --> 01:23:12,939
This helps us how?

1062
01:23:13,116 --> 01:23:16,210
The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

1063
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:20,514
-How are we gonna reconcile them?
-I'm working on that.

1064
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:24,217
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.

1065
01:23:24,394 --> 01:23:27,955
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

1066
01:24:03,066 --> 01:24:04,090
Damn it.

1067
01:24:04,267 --> 01:24:07,259
You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

1068
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:27,012
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1069
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:31,217
-Destroy his one positive relationship?
-No, repair his relationship with his father...

1070
01:24:31,394 --> 01:24:33,692
...whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

1071
01:24:33,863 --> 01:24:36,855
We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.

1072
01:24:37,033 --> 01:24:39,399
His security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.

1073
01:24:39,569 --> 01:24:42,060
-I think we run with Mr. Charles.
-No.

1074
01:24:42,472 --> 01:24:43,905
-Who's Mr. Charles?
-Bad idea.

1075
01:24:44,073 --> 01:24:47,600
The second we get into that hotel
his security's gonna be all over us.

1076
01:24:47,777 --> 01:24:49,870
We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.

1077
01:24:50,046 --> 01:24:52,378
-You've done it before?
-Yeah, and it didn't work.

1078
01:24:52,548 --> 01:24:56,040
The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1079
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:58,244
Excellent. But you
learned a lot, right?

1080
01:24:58,421 --> 01:25:00,514
-I need some kind of distraction.
-No problem.

1081
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:02,885
How about a lovely lady
that I've used before?

1082
01:25:03,059 --> 01:25:05,118
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?

1083
01:25:05,294 --> 01:25:07,762
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

1084
01:25:12,301 --> 01:25:15,668
Don't jump too soon. We only got one
shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

1085
01:25:15,838 --> 01:25:19,137
I'll play the music to let you know
it's coming. The rest is on you.

1086
01:25:19,308 --> 01:25:21,105
-You ready?
-Ready!

1087
01:25:22,345 --> 01:25:23,437
Sweet dreams.

1088
01:25:23,613 --> 01:25:25,513
Am I boring you?

1089
01:25:26,816 --> 01:25:30,013
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.

1090
01:25:31,854 --> 01:25:34,516
Um, I have a lot on my mind.

1091
01:25:36,059 --> 01:25:37,651
There goes Mr. Charles.

1092
01:25:42,365 --> 01:25:44,993
Mr. Fischer, right?

1093
01:25:45,168 --> 01:25:48,660
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. I--

1094
01:25:48,838 --> 01:25:49,964
Hmm.

1095
01:25:50,139 --> 01:25:52,801
-And you must be?
-Leaving.

1096
01:25:56,045 --> 01:25:57,171
In case you get bored.

1097
01:26:02,418 --> 01:26:03,783
Must've blown you off.

1098
01:26:03,953 --> 01:26:06,683
That is, unless her phone number
really is only six digits.

1099
01:26:08,858 --> 01:26:13,295
Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing your wallet like that.

1100
01:26:17,233 --> 01:26:19,565
Goddamn it. The wallet alone
is worth at least 500--

1101
01:26:19,735 --> 01:26:20,861
About $500, right?

1102
01:26:21,037 --> 01:26:24,006
Don't worry about it. My people
are already on it as we speak.

1103
01:26:24,173 --> 01:26:26,107
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

1104
01:26:26,309 --> 01:26:30,006
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

1105
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:31,510
And why don't you approve?

1106
01:26:31,681 --> 01:26:33,672
It involves telling the mark
that he's dreaming...

1107
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:35,977
...which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

1108
01:26:36,152 --> 01:26:39,087
-Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
-Hmm.

1109
01:26:39,255 --> 01:26:41,018
So now you've noticed how much time...

1110
01:26:41,190 --> 01:26:43,818
...Cobb spends doing things
he says never to do.

1111
01:26:45,561 --> 01:26:47,324
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?

1112
01:26:47,497 --> 01:26:49,931
-I'm sorry, but...
-Hold on! Wait!

1113
01:26:51,267 --> 01:26:52,564
You look a bit perkier.

1114
01:26:52,735 --> 01:26:55,067
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

1115
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:02,800
Turbulence on the plane?

1116
01:27:02,979 --> 01:27:04,674
No, it's much closer.

1117
01:27:04,847 --> 01:27:06,508
That's Yusuf's driving.

1118
01:27:14,857 --> 01:27:17,325
Um, I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?

1119
01:27:17,493 --> 01:27:19,586
Rod Green from marketing.

1120
01:27:19,762 --> 01:27:21,354
But that's not true at all, is it?

1121
01:27:23,466 --> 01:27:26,924
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?

1122
01:27:27,136 --> 01:27:29,104
I'm the head of your
security down here.

1123
01:27:30,373 --> 01:27:32,307
Get out on a different floor,
keep moving.

1124
01:27:32,475 --> 01:27:34,807
Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.

1125
01:27:34,977 --> 01:27:38,469
-Okay.
-We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

1126
01:27:42,118 --> 01:27:43,676
Security, huh?

1127
01:27:46,122 --> 01:27:48,283
-You work for the hotel?
-No, no.

1128
01:27:48,457 --> 01:27:53,053
I specialize in a very specific type
of security.

1129
01:27:53,462 --> 01:27:55,123
Subconscious security.

1130
01:27:55,298 --> 01:27:57,391
You're talking about dreams?

1131
01:27:57,567 --> 01:28:00,434
Are you talking about, um, extraction?

1132
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:02,869
I am here to protect you.

1133
01:28:16,319 --> 01:28:18,844
Mr. Fischer, I'm here
to protect you in the event...

1134
01:28:19,021 --> 01:28:22,388
...that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

1135
01:28:22,558 --> 01:28:25,186
You're not safe here.

1136
01:28:26,028 --> 01:28:27,620
They're coming for you.

1137
01:28:45,982 --> 01:28:48,007
Strange weather, isn't it?

1138
01:28:52,855 --> 01:28:53,981
You feel that?

1139
01:28:55,958 --> 01:28:57,152
What's happening?

1140
01:28:57,326 --> 01:29:00,557
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream...

1141
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:03,597
...which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer.

1142
01:29:03,766 --> 01:29:06,826
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.

1143
01:29:11,841 --> 01:29:15,709
-They're still looking at us.
-Yeah, it was worth a shot.

1144
01:29:16,379 --> 01:29:18,404
We should probably get out of here.

1145
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:37,257
You feel that? You've actually
been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

1146
01:29:37,433 --> 01:29:41,426
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shift in gravity.

1147
01:29:41,604 --> 01:29:44,767
None of this is real.
You're in a dream.

1148
01:29:49,578 --> 01:29:51,808
Now, the easiest way
for you to test yourself...

1149
01:29:52,014 --> 01:29:56,075
...is to try and remember how you
arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?

1150
01:29:56,919 --> 01:29:58,216
Yeah, I...

1151
01:29:58,387 --> 01:30:00,912
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.

1152
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:06,255
Accept the fact that you're in a dream,
and I'm here to protect you. Go on.

1153
01:30:08,264 --> 01:30:09,629
Mm-hm.

1154
01:30:12,435 --> 01:30:14,266
-You're not real?
-No.

1155
01:30:14,437 --> 01:30:17,804
No. I'm a projection
of your subconscious.

1156
01:30:17,973 --> 01:30:20,066
I was sent here to protect you
in the event...

1157
01:30:20,242 --> 01:30:23,143
...that extractors
tried to pull you into a dream.

1158
01:30:23,312 --> 01:30:26,543
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1159
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:28,674
Yeah.

1160
01:30:28,851 --> 01:30:29,943
Okay.

1161
01:30:30,853 --> 01:30:32,081
Okay.

1162
01:30:34,924 --> 01:30:36,915
Can you get me out of here?

1163
01:30:37,827 --> 01:30:40,421
Right away. Follow me.

1164
01:30:54,643 --> 01:30:55,974
Hold on a second.

1165
01:31:00,916 --> 01:31:02,747
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

1166
01:31:02,918 --> 01:31:05,182
These men were sent here
to abduct you, all right?

1167
01:31:05,354 --> 01:31:07,914
If you want my help,
you have to remain calm.

1168
01:31:09,658 --> 01:31:11,956
I need you to work
with me, Mr. Fischer.

1169
01:31:23,672 --> 01:31:27,267
If this is a dream, I should just
kill myself to wake up, right?

1170
01:31:27,443 --> 01:31:29,536
I wouldn't do that if I were you,
Mr. Fischer.

1171
01:31:29,712 --> 01:31:33,204
I believe they have you sedated,
and if you pull that trigger...

1172
01:31:33,382 --> 01:31:34,542
...you may not wake up.

1173
01:31:35,684 --> 01:31:39,984
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

1174
01:31:42,324 --> 01:31:43,985
You remember the training.

1175
01:31:45,127 --> 01:31:46,526
Remember what I said to you.

1176
01:31:47,396 --> 01:31:48,556
Give me the gun.

1177
01:32:00,376 --> 01:32:02,970
-This room should be directly below 528?
-Yeah.

1178
01:32:12,354 --> 01:32:13,844
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

1179
01:32:14,023 --> 01:32:17,857
What do you remember
from before this dream?

1180
01:32:18,227 --> 01:32:20,855
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.

1181
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:23,624
There was rain.

1182
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:25,758
Uncle Peter.

1183
01:32:26,035 --> 01:32:29,664
-Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
-Where were they holding you?

1184
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:35,973
-They had us in the back of a van.
-That explains the gravity shifts.

1185
01:32:36,178 --> 01:32:38,237
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.

1186
01:32:38,414 --> 01:32:40,678
It had something to do with, um...

1187
01:32:41,317 --> 01:32:44,184
Something to do with a safe.

1188
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:46,447
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1189
01:32:46,622 --> 01:32:49,318
It's like trying to remember a dream
after you've woken up.

1190
01:32:49,492 --> 01:32:51,221
Listen, it takes years of practice.

1191
01:32:51,393 --> 01:32:53,793
You and Browning have been pulled
into this dream...

1192
01:32:53,963 --> 01:32:56,727
...because they're trying to steal
something from your mind.

1193
01:32:56,899 --> 01:33:00,460
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1194
01:33:00,636 --> 01:33:02,263
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

1195
01:33:02,438 --> 01:33:06,169
A combination. They demanded
the first numbers to pop into my head.

1196
01:33:06,342 --> 01:33:09,072
They're trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.

1197
01:33:09,245 --> 01:33:13,011
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

1198
01:33:13,816 --> 01:33:16,944
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1199
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:19,952
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1200
01:33:20,122 --> 01:33:21,453
Five.

1201
01:33:22,424 --> 01:33:24,858
Five, two--It was something,
it was a long number.

1202
01:33:25,027 --> 01:33:27,120
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.

1203
01:33:27,296 --> 01:33:28,320
Yep.

1204
01:33:28,497 --> 01:33:32,524
-So do you use a timer?
-No, I have to judge it for myself.

1205
01:33:32,735 --> 01:33:36,000
While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1206
01:33:36,171 --> 01:33:38,298
-Well, how will you know?
-His music warns me.

1207
01:33:38,474 --> 01:33:42,410
And then when the van hits the barrier of
the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1208
01:33:42,578 --> 01:33:45,775
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

1209
01:33:45,948 --> 01:33:48,348
If it's too soon,
we won't get pulled out.

1210
01:33:48,517 --> 01:33:51,782
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.

1211
01:33:51,954 --> 01:33:55,754
-Well, why not?
-Because the van will be in freefall.

1212
01:33:56,292 --> 01:33:59,125
-Can't drop you without gravity.
-Right.

1213
01:34:04,767 --> 01:34:06,997
They're with me. Go on.

1214
01:34:31,327 --> 01:34:32,351
Mr. Charles.

1215
01:34:32,528 --> 01:34:35,497
-Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
-Yeah, I think so.

1216
01:34:35,664 --> 01:34:37,723
They were trying to put you under.

1217
01:34:38,167 --> 01:34:40,226
-I'm already under.
-Under again.

1218
01:34:40,402 --> 01:34:42,962
What do you mean,
a dream within a dream?

1219
01:34:43,572 --> 01:34:46,040
Hey. I see you've changed.

1220
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:47,835
I'm sorry?

1221
01:34:48,344 --> 01:34:52,212
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.

1222
01:34:52,381 --> 01:34:53,643
Oh.

1223
01:34:53,816 --> 01:34:55,943
Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

1224
01:34:56,619 --> 01:34:59,554
No, no, no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.

1225
01:34:59,722 --> 01:35:01,587
Let's follow him
and see how he behaves.

1226
01:35:01,757 --> 01:35:03,725
-Why?
-Because how he acts will tell us...

1227
01:35:03,892 --> 01:35:07,225
...if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.

1228
01:35:07,396 --> 01:35:08,420
Shh.

1229
01:35:13,002 --> 01:35:15,493
-Uncle Peter.
-You said you were kidnapped together?

1230
01:35:15,671 --> 01:35:19,107
Well, not exactly. They already
had him. They were torturing him.

1231
01:35:19,274 --> 01:35:20,741
And you saw them torture him?

1232
01:35:28,283 --> 01:35:30,114
The kidnappers are working for you?

1233
01:35:31,086 --> 01:35:32,553
Robert.

1234
01:35:32,721 --> 01:35:36,555
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?

1235
01:35:36,959 --> 01:35:41,191
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.

1236
01:35:41,363 --> 01:35:43,729
I'm not gonna throw away
my inheritance.

1237
01:35:43,899 --> 01:35:48,063
I couldn't let you rise
to your father's last taunt.

1238
01:35:48,871 --> 01:35:51,897
-What taunt?
-The will, Robert. That will?

1239
01:35:52,074 --> 01:35:54,008
That's his last insult.

1240
01:35:54,176 --> 01:35:57,805
A challenge for you to build something
for yourself...

1241
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:01,780
...by telling you you're not worthy
of his accomplishments.

1242
01:36:07,456 --> 01:36:12,826
-What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
-I'm sorry.

1243
01:36:14,196 --> 01:36:17,290
But he's wrong.

1244
01:36:18,033 --> 01:36:20,661
You can build a better company
than he ever did.

1245
01:36:20,836 --> 01:36:23,270
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.

1246
01:36:23,439 --> 01:36:25,532
-How do you know?
-Trust me, it's what I do.

1247
01:36:25,708 --> 01:36:28,472
He's hiding something,
and we need to find out what that is.

1248
01:36:29,678 --> 01:36:33,079
I need you to do the same thing to him
that he was going to do to you.

1249
01:36:35,651 --> 01:36:39,712
We'll enter his subconscious and find
out what he doesn't want you to know.

1250
01:36:40,989 --> 01:36:42,456
All right.

1251
01:36:48,430 --> 01:36:49,692
-He's out.
-Wait.

1252
01:36:49,865 --> 01:36:51,924
Whose subconscious are
we going into exactly?

1253
01:36:52,101 --> 01:36:53,432
We're going into Fischer's.

1254
01:36:53,602 --> 01:36:56,298
I told him it was Browning's
so he'd be a part of our team.

1255
01:36:56,472 --> 01:36:58,804
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

1256
01:36:58,974 --> 01:37:00,532
That's right.

1257
01:37:00,709 --> 01:37:02,768
Security's gonna run you down hard.

1258
01:37:02,945 --> 01:37:05,277
And I will lead them on a merry chase.

1259
01:37:05,848 --> 01:37:08,476
-Just be back before the kick.
-Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1260
01:37:13,689 --> 01:37:14,883
You good?

1261
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:19,391
Hey. You ready?

1262
01:37:19,561 --> 01:37:23,156
Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.

1263
01:37:35,711 --> 01:37:37,042
Cobb?

1264
01:37:37,713 --> 01:37:40,147
Cobb? What's down there?

1265
01:37:43,519 --> 01:37:46,113
Hopefully, the truth
we want Fischer to learn.

1266
01:37:46,288 --> 01:37:48,188
I mean, what's down there for you?

1267
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:26,543
Did you see that?

1268
01:40:45,033 --> 01:40:46,864
Eames, this is your dream.

1269
01:40:47,035 --> 01:40:50,129
I need you to draw the security away
from the complex, understand?

1270
01:40:50,305 --> 01:40:52,102
-Who guides Fischer in?
-Not me.

1271
01:40:52,274 --> 01:40:54,742
If I know the route,
everything could be compromised.

1272
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:57,435
-I designed the place.
-No, you're with me.

1273
01:40:57,612 --> 01:40:59,136
I could do it.

1274
01:40:59,581 --> 01:41:02,015
All right. Brief him on the route
into the complex.

1275
01:41:02,184 --> 01:41:06,382
-Fischer, you'll be going with him.
-All right. What about you?

1276
01:41:06,555 --> 01:41:09,388
You keep this live.
I'll be listening in the whole time.

1277
01:41:09,558 --> 01:41:13,688
The windows on that upper floor are big
enough for me to cover you from that tower.

1278
01:41:13,862 --> 01:41:15,159
You're not coming in?

1279
01:41:15,330 --> 01:41:17,662
In order to find out the truth
about your father...

1280
01:41:17,833 --> 01:41:20,859
...you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.

1281
01:41:21,737 --> 01:41:23,204
Come on, Fischer!

1282
01:42:18,293 --> 01:42:21,956
-Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
-Go, go, go!

1283
01:42:22,130 --> 01:42:23,654
Move!

1284
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:26,258
Go!

1285
01:42:41,483 --> 01:42:42,507
Sod it.

1286
01:42:53,695 --> 01:42:55,356
I hope you're ready.

1287
01:43:04,106 --> 01:43:05,869
No, it's too soon.

1288
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:13,574
Cobb, do you hear that?

1289
01:43:13,748 --> 01:43:17,309
I first noticed it about 20 minutes
ago, I thought it was the wind up here.

1290
01:43:17,853 --> 01:43:20,344
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.

1291
01:43:20,522 --> 01:43:21,921
So, what do we do?

1292
01:43:22,090 --> 01:43:23,489
We move fast.

1293
01:43:28,997 --> 01:43:31,227
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.

1294
01:43:33,101 --> 01:43:35,467
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1295
01:43:36,404 --> 01:43:38,497
-Hey!
-That's him!

1296
01:43:39,174 --> 01:43:40,903
-Which gives us what?
-Sixty minutes.

1297
01:43:41,076 --> 01:43:44,341
-Can they make that route in an hour?
-They have to climb to the terrace.

1298
01:43:44,513 --> 01:43:47,380
Then they need a new route,
a more direct route.

1299
01:43:58,593 --> 01:44:00,220
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1300
01:44:00,395 --> 01:44:02,863
There must be access routes
that cut through the maze.

1301
01:44:03,031 --> 01:44:04,623
Eames?

1302
01:44:27,722 --> 01:44:28,984
Did Eames add any features?

1303
01:44:29,157 --> 01:44:30,624
I don't think I should tell you.

1304
01:44:30,792 --> 01:44:33,090
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?

1305
01:44:33,528 --> 01:44:36,292
He added an air-duct system
that can cut through the maze.

1306
01:44:36,464 --> 01:44:37,658
Good. Explain it to them.

1307
01:44:37,832 --> 01:44:39,060
-Saito?
-Go ahead.

1308
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,958
Paradox.

1309
01:46:23,838 --> 01:46:25,897
-What was that?
-The kick.

1310
01:46:26,508 --> 01:46:28,408
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?

1311
01:46:28,576 --> 01:46:30,271
Yeah, we missed it.

1312
01:46:30,445 --> 01:46:31,639
Man.

1313
01:46:31,813 --> 01:46:36,113
Couldn't someone have dreamt up
a goddamn beach? Huh?

1314
01:46:36,284 --> 01:46:37,546
Uh-huh.

1315
01:46:38,286 --> 01:46:40,447
Well, what the hell do we do now?

1316
01:46:40,622 --> 01:46:42,453
We finish the job before the next kick.

1317
01:46:42,624 --> 01:46:44,717
-What next kick?
-When the van hits the water.

1318
01:47:07,582 --> 01:47:11,018
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

1319
01:47:11,186 --> 01:47:13,017
If you need help, hang up...

1320
01:47:13,254 --> 01:47:16,553
How do I drop you without gravity?

1321
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:21,722
Arthur has a couple minutes,
and we have about 20.

1322
01:47:45,153 --> 01:47:46,814
You okay?

1323
01:47:51,292 --> 01:47:55,160
Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!

1324
01:47:55,330 --> 01:47:56,854
Go, go, go!

1325
01:47:59,033 --> 01:48:00,193
There's something wrong.

1326
01:48:00,368 --> 01:48:02,700
They're heading your way,
like they know something.

1327
01:48:03,938 --> 01:48:06,168
Just buy us more time, all right?

1328
01:48:06,341 --> 01:48:08,172
-Come on!
-On my way.

1329
01:48:08,343 --> 01:48:10,038
Come on! Move!

1330
01:49:34,229 --> 01:49:35,753
All right.

1331
01:49:47,942 --> 01:49:50,740
Okay. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.

1332
01:49:50,912 --> 01:49:54,404
-Does the strong room have windows?
-It wouldn't be very strong if it did.

1333
01:49:54,582 --> 01:49:56,812
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

1334
01:49:58,453 --> 01:50:01,786
-Are those projections his subconscious?
-Yes.

1335
01:50:01,956 --> 01:50:05,323
-Are you destroying parts of his mind?
-No. They're just projections.

1336
01:50:31,619 --> 01:50:33,348
-We're here.
-You're clear, but hurry.

1337
01:50:33,521 --> 01:50:35,352
There's an entire army headed your way.

1338
01:51:02,183 --> 01:51:03,548
I'm in.

1339
01:51:08,856 --> 01:51:09,982
There he is.

1340
01:51:52,634 --> 01:51:55,330
-There's someone in there.
-Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.

1341
01:51:56,504 --> 01:51:59,064
Come on. Come on, a little lower.

1342
01:52:04,812 --> 01:52:05,972
Cobb.

1343
01:52:06,614 --> 01:52:09,139
No, she is not real.

1344
01:52:09,751 --> 01:52:10,979
How do you know that?

1345
01:52:11,152 --> 01:52:14,781
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.

1346
01:52:18,793 --> 01:52:20,317
Hello.

1347
01:52:24,999 --> 01:52:28,196
Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!

1348
01:53:12,113 --> 01:53:14,980
-What happened?
-Mal killed Fischer.

1349
01:53:17,251 --> 01:53:19,276
I couldn't shoot her.

1350
01:53:19,954 --> 01:53:23,321
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.

1351
01:53:23,491 --> 01:53:24,549
It's all over.

1352
01:53:26,294 --> 01:53:27,921
So that's it, then? We failed?

1353
01:53:28,563 --> 01:53:30,724
We're done. I'm sorry.

1354
01:53:34,602 --> 01:53:37,230
It's not me that doesn't get back
to my family, is it?

1355
01:53:37,939 --> 01:53:41,841
Shame. I wanted to know what was gonna
happen in there. I swear we had this.

1356
01:53:42,009 --> 01:53:44,068
Let's set the charges.

1357
01:53:45,913 --> 01:53:47,403
No, there's still another way.

1358
01:53:48,716 --> 01:53:52,117
-We have to follow Fischer down there.
-Not enough time.

1359
01:53:52,286 --> 01:53:55,119
No, but there will be enough time
down there.

1360
01:53:56,257 --> 01:53:57,349
And we will find him.

1361
01:53:57,525 --> 01:54:01,461
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1362
01:54:01,629 --> 01:54:04,530
We can give him his own kick
down below.

1363
01:54:05,566 --> 01:54:07,261
Look, you get him in there.

1364
01:54:07,435 --> 01:54:10,302
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital...

1365
01:54:10,471 --> 01:54:13,269
...and we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

1366
01:54:14,475 --> 01:54:19,242
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold
the guards off while I set the charges.

1367
01:54:19,413 --> 01:54:21,506
Saito will never make it, will he?

1368
01:54:22,817 --> 01:54:26,014
-Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
-Go for it.

1369
01:54:26,187 --> 01:54:29,122
If you are not back before the kick,
I am gone with or without you.

1370
01:54:29,290 --> 01:54:32,521
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.

1371
01:54:36,764 --> 01:54:38,959
Can I trust you to do
what needs to happen here?

1372
01:54:39,133 --> 01:54:40,327
Mal's gonna be down there.

1373
01:54:40,501 --> 01:54:42,935
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

1374
01:54:43,104 --> 01:54:47,006
-How do you know?
-Because she wants me to come after him.

1375
01:54:47,175 --> 01:54:49,336
She wants me back down there with her.

1376
01:55:16,103 --> 01:55:17,127
All right?

1377
01:55:24,378 --> 01:55:27,040
-This is your world?
-It was.

1378
01:55:27,849 --> 01:55:29,783
And this is where she'll be.

1379
01:55:30,585 --> 01:55:32,075
Come on.

1380
01:56:18,566 --> 01:56:21,034
Saito. Saito.

1381
01:56:21,469 --> 01:56:25,428
I need you to take care of Fischer
while I go set some charges, okay?

1382
01:56:25,606 --> 01:56:29,042
No room for tourists on these jobs.

1383
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:32,839
Don't be silly.

1384
01:57:05,346 --> 01:57:07,405
You built all this? This is incredible.

1385
01:57:07,882 --> 01:57:09,907
We built for years.

1386
01:57:10,952 --> 01:57:12,943
Then we started in on the memories.

1387
01:57:19,994 --> 01:57:21,393
This way.

1388
01:58:03,070 --> 01:58:05,163
This was our neighborhood.

1389
01:58:05,339 --> 01:58:07,671
Places from our past.

1390
01:58:07,842 --> 01:58:09,605
That was our first apartment.

1391
01:58:09,777 --> 01:58:12,007
Then we moved to that building
right there.

1392
01:58:12,179 --> 01:58:14,704
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

1393
01:58:14,882 --> 01:58:17,680
You reconstructed all of this
from memory?

1394
01:58:17,852 --> 01:58:20,116
Like I told you, we had lots of time.

1395
01:58:20,287 --> 01:58:21,879
What is that?

1396
01:58:23,424 --> 01:58:25,187
That's the house Mal grew up in.

1397
01:58:25,359 --> 01:58:27,793
-Well, will she be in there?
-No.

1398
01:58:28,129 --> 01:58:29,153
Come on.

1399
01:58:29,330 --> 01:58:32,663
We both wanted to live in a house,
but we loved this type of building.

1400
01:58:32,833 --> 01:58:35,768
In the real world,
we'd have to choose, but not here.

1401
01:59:16,343 --> 01:59:18,368
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?

1402
01:59:18,779 --> 01:59:21,213
We're gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

1403
01:59:21,382 --> 01:59:22,781
What?

1404
01:59:23,784 --> 01:59:24,876
I'm gonna improvise.

1405
01:59:25,052 --> 01:59:29,716
Listen, there's something you should
know about me. About inception.

1406
01:59:42,803 --> 01:59:46,671
An idea is like a virus. Resilient.

1407
01:59:47,508 --> 01:59:49,066
Highly contagious.

1408
01:59:49,243 --> 01:59:52,576
And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

1409
01:59:53,647 --> 01:59:55,615
It can grow to define...

1410
01:59:56,650 --> 01:59:58,208
...or destroy you.

1411
02:00:01,355 --> 02:00:04,119
The smallest idea, such as:

1412
02:00:04,725 --> 02:00:07,091
"Your world is not real."

1413
02:00:07,361 --> 02:00:11,127
Simple little thought
that changes everything.

1414
02:00:12,366 --> 02:00:16,860
So certain of your world.
Of what's real.

1415
02:00:17,037 --> 02:00:18,834
Do you think he is?

1416
02:00:20,641 --> 02:00:23,542
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?

1417
02:00:24,678 --> 02:00:26,168
I know what's real, Mal.

1418
02:00:28,249 --> 02:00:30,547
No creeping doubts?

1419
02:00:31,252 --> 02:00:33,880
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1420
02:00:34,188 --> 02:00:35,519
Chased around the globe...

1421
02:00:35,689 --> 02:00:38,351
...by anonymous corporations
and police forces...

1422
02:00:38,526 --> 02:00:41,154
...the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1423
02:00:42,763 --> 02:00:44,253
Admit it.

1424
02:00:45,566 --> 02:00:48,399
You don't believe in
one reality anymore.

1425
02:00:48,569 --> 02:00:50,093
So choose.

1426
02:00:50,271 --> 02:00:52,535
Choose to be here.

1427
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:54,530
Choose me.

1428
02:01:20,401 --> 02:01:21,663
You know what I have to do.

1429
02:01:21,835 --> 02:01:24,497
I have to get back to our children
because you left them.

1430
02:01:25,839 --> 02:01:27,363
Because you left us.

1431
02:01:27,541 --> 02:01:29,338
-You're wrong.
-I'm not wrong.

1432
02:01:29,510 --> 02:01:31,535
You're confused.

1433
02:01:32,646 --> 02:01:34,705
Our children are here.

1434
02:01:35,482 --> 02:01:38,747
And you'd like to see their
faces again, wouldn't you?

1435
02:01:38,919 --> 02:01:41,979
Yes, but I'm gonna see them
up above, Mal.

1436
02:01:55,636 --> 02:01:57,627
Up above?

1437
02:01:58,539 --> 02:02:02,168
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.

1438
02:02:02,710 --> 02:02:04,075
Watch.

1439
02:02:04,578 --> 02:02:06,273
James? Phillipa?

1440
02:02:06,447 --> 02:02:08,881
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.

1441
02:02:09,049 --> 02:02:11,517
You keep telling yourself that,
but you don't believe it.

1442
02:02:11,685 --> 02:02:13,585
-No, I know it.
-What if you're wrong?

1443
02:02:13,988 --> 02:02:16,286
What if I'm what's real?

1444
02:02:17,491 --> 02:02:19,721
You keep telling
yourself what you know.

1445
02:02:21,295 --> 02:02:23,525
But what do you believe?

1446
02:02:24,498 --> 02:02:25,726
What do you feel?

1447
02:02:27,868 --> 02:02:29,301
Guilt.

1448
02:02:30,504 --> 02:02:32,734
I feel guilt, Mal.

1449
02:02:33,274 --> 02:02:37,210
And no matter what I do,
no matter how hopeless I am...

1450
02:02:37,378 --> 02:02:41,644
...no matter how confused,
that guilt is always there...

1451
02:02:41,815 --> 02:02:44,340
...reminding me of the truth.

1452
02:02:44,852 --> 02:02:46,149
What truth?

1453
02:02:48,589 --> 02:02:53,822
That the idea that caused you to
question your reality came from me.

1454
02:02:57,197 --> 02:03:00,325
You planted the idea in my mind?

1455
02:03:01,835 --> 02:03:03,325
What is she talking about?

1456
02:03:04,238 --> 02:03:09,505
The reason I knew inception was possible
was because I did it to her first.

1457
02:03:10,544 --> 02:03:13,513
-I did it to my own wife.
-Why?

1458
02:03:14,248 --> 02:03:15,738
We were lost in here.

1459
02:03:16,684 --> 02:03:21,314
I knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.

1460
02:03:24,525 --> 02:03:30,191
She had locked something away,
something deep inside.

1461
02:03:30,964 --> 02:03:35,094
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

1462
02:03:36,070 --> 02:03:38,197
And she couldn't break free.

1463
02:03:40,908 --> 02:03:43,638
So I decided to search for it.

1464
02:03:44,211 --> 02:03:49,080
I went deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.

1465
02:03:49,249 --> 02:03:51,149
And I broke in...

1466
02:03:51,719 --> 02:03:53,880
...and I planted an idea.

1467
02:03:54,621 --> 02:03:58,387
A simple little idea
that would change everything.

1468
02:04:03,630 --> 02:04:05,996
That her world wasn't real.

1469
02:04:18,812 --> 02:04:22,009
That death was the only escape.

1470
02:04:29,423 --> 02:04:31,186
You're waiting for a train.

1471
02:04:33,494 --> 02:04:36,224
A train that'll take you far away.

1472
02:04:37,398 --> 02:04:40,390
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

1473
02:04:41,502 --> 02:04:43,527
...but you can't know for sure.

1474
02:04:44,705 --> 02:04:46,229
Yet it doesn't matter.

1475
02:04:47,674 --> 02:04:50,837
-Now, tell me why!
-Because you'll be together!

1476
02:04:55,182 --> 02:04:59,243
But I never knew that that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...

1477
02:04:59,420 --> 02:05:01,820
...that even after she woke...

1478
02:05:04,725 --> 02:05:07,193
That even after
you came back to reality...

1479
02:05:10,130 --> 02:05:13,099
...that you'd continue to believe
your world wasn't real.

1480
02:05:15,869 --> 02:05:18,269
That death was the only escape.

1481
02:05:18,439 --> 02:05:21,101
Mal, no! Jesus!

1482
02:05:21,275 --> 02:05:24,972
-You infected my mind.
-I was trying to save you.

1483
02:05:25,145 --> 02:05:26,544
You betrayed me.

1484
02:05:27,381 --> 02:05:31,078
But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.

1485
02:05:31,251 --> 02:05:34,277
We can still be together, right here...

1486
02:05:34,455 --> 02:05:36,923
...in the world we built together.

1487
02:06:57,738 --> 02:07:00,070
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1488
02:07:00,941 --> 02:07:02,238
You can't have him.

1489
02:07:03,277 --> 02:07:06,713
-If I stay here, will you let him go?
-What are you talking about?

1490
02:07:11,184 --> 02:07:13,015
Fischer is on the porch.

1491
02:07:13,587 --> 02:07:16,181
-Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
-Cobb, you can't do this.

1492
02:07:16,356 --> 02:07:18,984
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.

1493
02:07:34,641 --> 02:07:37,735
He's here! And it's time,
but you have to come now!

1494
02:07:37,911 --> 02:07:41,574
-You take Fischer with you, all right?
-You can't stay here to be with her.

1495
02:07:44,151 --> 02:07:46,847
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.

1496
02:07:47,020 --> 02:07:50,512
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.

1497
02:07:52,526 --> 02:07:55,620
I can't stay with her anymore,
because she doesn't exist.

1498
02:07:55,796 --> 02:07:59,197
I'm the only thing
you do believe in anymore.

1499
02:07:59,366 --> 02:08:00,697
No.

1500
02:08:01,868 --> 02:08:03,301
I wish.

1501
02:08:04,905 --> 02:08:07,396
I wish more than anything, but...

1502
02:08:08,508 --> 02:08:11,238
...I can't imagine you
with all your complexity...

1503
02:08:11,411 --> 02:08:13,936
...all your perfection,
all your imperfection.

1504
02:08:15,048 --> 02:08:16,072
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1505
02:08:16,249 --> 02:08:18,080
Look at you.

1506
02:08:19,319 --> 02:08:24,256
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.

1507
02:08:24,691 --> 02:08:27,319
And you were the best
that I could do, but...

1508
02:08:28,161 --> 02:08:30,595
...I'm sorry, you're
just not good enough.

1509
02:08:30,764 --> 02:08:32,391
Does this feel real?

1510
02:08:34,801 --> 02:08:37,395
-What are you doing?
-Improvising.

1511
02:08:46,013 --> 02:08:47,708
No, no, no!

1512
02:08:48,682 --> 02:08:51,082
In there, now. Go, go, go.

1513
02:09:35,929 --> 02:09:37,829
I was dis--

1514
02:09:39,533 --> 02:09:41,865
I was dis--Disa--

1515
02:09:42,736 --> 02:09:45,261
-I know, Dad.
-Dis--

1516
02:09:51,278 --> 02:09:53,371
I know you were disappointed...

1517
02:09:54,181 --> 02:09:55,546
...I couldn't be you.

1518
02:09:55,949 --> 02:09:57,439
No.

1519
02:09:57,951 --> 02:09:59,179
No, no, no.

1520
02:10:00,220 --> 02:10:02,211
I was disappointed...

1521
02:10:03,957 --> 02:10:05,891
...that you tried.

1522
02:10:29,149 --> 02:10:30,810
What?

1523
02:10:40,260 --> 02:10:41,386
Come on, come on.

1524
02:11:11,625 --> 02:11:13,115
Dad?

1525
02:11:51,465 --> 02:11:54,525
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

1526
02:12:07,380 --> 02:12:10,816
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

1527
02:12:10,984 --> 02:12:12,645
I will!

1528
02:12:52,392 --> 02:12:55,555
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

1529
02:12:55,729 --> 02:12:56,821
Yes.

1530
02:12:56,997 --> 02:13:00,057
You said you dreamt
that we'd grow old together.

1531
02:13:02,769 --> 02:13:04,259
But we did.

1532
02:13:06,206 --> 02:13:08,572
We did. You don't remember?

1533
02:13:13,246 --> 02:13:16,079
I miss you more than I can bear...

1534
02:13:18,451 --> 02:13:20,442
...but we had our time together.

1535
02:13:21,788 --> 02:13:23,847
And I have to let you go.

1536
02:13:25,959 --> 02:13:27,756
I have to let you go.

1537
02:14:19,012 --> 02:14:20,309
I'm sorry, Robert.

1538
02:14:47,974 --> 02:14:51,637
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

1539
02:14:52,712 --> 02:14:54,737
...not just to live for him.

1540
02:14:56,349 --> 02:14:58,874
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1541
02:15:08,662 --> 02:15:09,890
What happened?

1542
02:15:10,363 --> 02:15:12,058
-Cobb stayed.
-With Mal?

1543
02:15:12,232 --> 02:15:13,494
No, to find Saito.

1544
02:15:15,769 --> 02:15:17,532
He'll be lost.

1545
02:15:20,073 --> 02:15:21,904
No, he'll be all right.

1546
02:15:37,924 --> 02:15:39,892
Have you come to kill me?

1547
02:15:44,164 --> 02:15:46,632
I'm waiting for someone.

1548
02:15:51,104 --> 02:15:53,868
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1549
02:15:56,609 --> 02:15:58,008
Cobb?

1550
02:15:59,946 --> 02:16:01,709
Impossible.

1551
02:16:02,248 --> 02:16:04,842
We were young men together.

1552
02:16:06,453 --> 02:16:08,785
I'm an old man.

1553
02:16:10,023 --> 02:16:12,082
Filled with regret.

1554
02:16:15,228 --> 02:16:17,924
Waiting to die alone.

1555
02:16:21,101 --> 02:16:23,262
I've come back for you.

1556
02:16:26,539 --> 02:16:30,407
To remind you of something.

1557
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:36,046
Something you once knew.

1558
02:16:38,918 --> 02:16:41,148
That this world is not real.

1559
02:16:46,059 --> 02:16:50,553
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

1560
02:16:51,397 --> 02:16:54,161
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1561
02:17:00,273 --> 02:17:01,604
Come back...

1562
02:17:04,144 --> 02:17:07,511
...so we can be
young men together again.

1563
02:17:11,284 --> 02:17:13,252
Come back with me.

1564
02:17:16,356 --> 02:17:17,789
Come back.

1565
02:17:27,534 --> 02:17:29,229
Hot towel, sir?

1566
02:17:29,869 --> 02:17:32,736
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

1567
02:17:32,906 --> 02:17:35,204
Do you need immigration forms?

1568
02:17:37,310 --> 02:17:38,641
Thank you.

1569
02:17:39,112 --> 02:17:40,739
Hot towel, sir?

1570
02:17:41,748 --> 02:17:44,740
-No.
-Do you need immigration forms?

1571
02:18:56,122 --> 02:18:57,180
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1572
02:18:58,324 --> 02:18:59,951
Thank you, sir.

1573
02:19:44,003 --> 02:19:45,368
Welcome.

1574
02:19:45,838 --> 02:19:47,237
This way.

1575
02:20:08,428 --> 02:20:11,886
James? Phillipa?

1576
02:20:15,635 --> 02:20:16,897
Look who's here.

1577
02:20:22,508 --> 02:20:23,566
Hey.

1578
02:20:24,677 --> 02:20:27,373
-Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
-Daddy! Daddy!

1579
02:20:27,547 --> 02:20:29,811
-Daddy!
-How are you?

1580
02:20:30,917 --> 02:20:32,509
Look what I've been building!

1581
02:20:32,685 --> 02:20:36,382
-What are you building?
-We're building a house on the cliff!

1582
02:20:36,556 --> 02:20:39,423
On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

1583
02:20:39,592 --> 02:20:42,152
-Let's go.
-Come on, Daddy!
