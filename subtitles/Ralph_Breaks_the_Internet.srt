1
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. My turn, my turn.
Um, I got one.</font>

2
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great, but can you make it</font>

3
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a little more challenging
this time?</font>

4
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:59,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Check this out.</font>

5
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:03,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spy with my little eye...</font>

6
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something yellow...</font>

7
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:11,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and round,
and it eats dots.</font>

8
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously, Ralph?</font>

9
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, seriously.
You're never gonna get it.</font>

10
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, obviously,
it's Pac-Man.</font>

11
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's not...</font>

12
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is that obvious?</font>

13
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Name one other thing
in this whole arcade</font>

14
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that is yellow and round
and eats dots.</font>

15
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can name two things.</font>

16
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Pac-Man
and Baby Pac-Man.</font>

17
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boom!
I accept your apology.</font>

18
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:33,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you're right. Okay.
But was it Pac-Man?</font>

19
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you got me.</font>

20
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:38,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knew it.
All right, riddle me this...</font>

21
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:42,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do you or do you not think
that Zangief waxes?</font>

22
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way. Look at the guy.
He looks like a yeti.</font>

23
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

24
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, if the fur
were confined to his chest,</font>

25
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:48,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I might agree...</font>

26
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but look at those
two very specific</font>

27
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">tuffets of shin hair...</font>

28
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">poking out of his boots.</font>

29
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:56,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That does not just happen,
Ralph. That is a choice.</font>

30
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're totally right, kid.</font>

31
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's baby smooth
everywhere else.</font>

32
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I rest my case.</font>

33
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:05,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mind is blown!</font>

34
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:06,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go get a root beer.</font>

35
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's see
what you got, kid.</font>

36
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh!</font>

37
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice one. Okay.</font>

38
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I got one
in the chamber.</font>

39
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ew!</font>

40
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:20,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Gross.
- Thank you.</font>

41
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, wanna sneak into Tron?</font>

42
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't that game
have a virus?</font>

43
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I'm sure
they fixed it.</font>

44
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:27,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

45
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:30,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna beat
my speed record!</font>

46
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:31,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, wait for me!</font>

47
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:41,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralph.</font>

48
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>

49
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
they fixed the game.</font>

50
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... No.</font>

51
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:49,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>

52
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:51,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Tron!</font>

53
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:53,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tronny!</font>

54
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tronny boy!</font>

55
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>

56
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you realize</font>

57
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're basically just, like,
zeroes and ones...</font>

58
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:07,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">floating around the universe
like tiny specks of dust?</font>

59
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, doesn't the very nature</font>

60
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of our existence
make you wonder...</font>

61
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if there's more to life
than this?</font>

62
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would I wonder
if there's more to life</font>

63
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when the life
I got is perfect?</font>

64
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, sure. Doesn't
look so hot on paper.</font>

65
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm just a bad guy
from some old video game</i></font>

66
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>who wrecks a building.</i></font>

67
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And yeah, for 27 years,</i></font>

68
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I was a total zero
without any friends.</i></font>

69
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:28,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now,
I got a best friend...</font>

70
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:29,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who just happens to be</font>

71
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:31,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the coolest kid
in the whole arcade.</font>

72
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, thanks, pal.</font>

73
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:34,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch this.</font>

74
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:38,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Home run!</font>

75
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:40,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's go
watch the sunrise.</font>

76
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you really saying</font>

77
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's not one single,
solitary thing...</font>

78
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:47,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about your life
that you would change?</font>

79
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:49,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, think about it.</font>

80
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:51,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and me get to
goof off all night long.</font>

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Litwak shows up, we go to
work, we put in our hours.</font>

82
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then the arcade closes</font>

83
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:58,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we get to do it
all over again.</font>

84
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:00,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only thing I might do
different in that scenario...</font>

85
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would be not having
to go to work.</font>

86
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Other than that,
I wouldn't change a thing.</font>

87
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

88
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where'd our sunrise go?</font>

89
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:12,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right,
let's get you plugged in.</font>

90
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a plug-in alert.</font>

91
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:18,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Litwak hasn't plugged in
a new game in forever.</font>

92
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's go see what it is!
- Yeah!</font>

93
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse us. Excuse us.
Minor emergency.</font>

94
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Felix, Calhoun,
what's getting plugged in?</font>

95
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Ralph, Sonic thinks</font>

96
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's gonna be
a new pinball machine.</font>

97
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think,
lady love?</font>

98
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:33,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll bet you a shiny nickel
it's a blood pressure machine.</font>

99
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Kids love those things.
- Ooh.</font>

100
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:39,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please be a racing game.
Please be a racing game.</font>

101
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please be a racing game.</font>

102
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:46,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Whiffee"? Or, "Wifey"?</font>

103
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:49,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's either wiffle ball,
or an arranged marriage game.</font>

104
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:51,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's actually pronounced
"Wi-Fi," Ralph.</font>

105
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's what I said.</font>

106
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:54,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Wi-Fi is the Internet...</font>

107
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is an online community</font>

108
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where human beings
go to shop...</font>

109
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:58,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and play games and socialize.</font>

110
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, fun!</font>

111
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, it is not.</font>

112
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:04,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That sign right there
says "Wi-Fi."</font>

113
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What it should say
is "Die-Fi."</font>

114
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a little humor there.</font>

115
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:12,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But seriously, the Internet
is nothing to laugh at.</font>

116
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:14,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is new, it is different,</font>

117
00:05:14,716 --> 00:05:16,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and therefore
we should fear it.</font>

118
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:18,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So keep out, for Pete's sake,
and get to work.</font>

119
00:05:18,553 --> 00:05:20,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The arcade's about to open.</font>

120
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:23,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Figures, we finally get
something new plugged in...</font>

121
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:25,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we're not even allowed
to go in there.</font>

122
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Totally not fair.</font>

123
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A new racing game
would've been cool.</font>

124
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:31,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something wrong
with your game?</font>

125
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:32,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.</font>

126
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:35,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just every bonus level's
been unlocked.</font>

127
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:37,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know every shortcut.</font>

128
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:39,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, I'd kill for even
just a new track.</font>

129
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:42,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">New track? You already got,
like, three choices.</font>

130
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know,
but don't you ever wish</font>

131
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:45,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something new
and different...</font>

132
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:46,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would happen in your game?</font>

133
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:47,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope.</font>

134
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:50,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Well,
agree to disagree.</font>

135
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:52,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, I don't wanna disagree.</font>

136
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:54,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. It's just
a fancy way to say</font>

137
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we don't have to
argue about it.</font>

138
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:57,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're arguing?
I don't wanna argue.</font>

139
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:00,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax. Stop making it
a thing.</font>

140
00:06:00,562 --> 00:06:03,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to work. I'll see you
tonight, stench vessel.</font>

141
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:04,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

142
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:11,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She wants a new track,
I'll give her a new track.</font>

143
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:18,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Nafisa!
Let's play Sugar Rush!</font>

144
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:20,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pick Vanellope, Swati.</font>

145
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's got
the best superpower.</font>

146
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:24,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, the glitch. I love her.</font>

147
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:25,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Drivers,</i></font>

148
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:28,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>start your engines.</i></font>

149
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:31,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna lose today,
Princess.</font>

150
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:34,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While, yes, I am technically
a princess, Taffyta...</font>

151
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd rather you just think of
me as plain old Vanellope...</font>

152
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:39,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the racer who's about to
kick your butt.</font>

153
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:42,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>3, 2, 1, go!</i></font>

154
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:49,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And pardon me, excuse me,
coming through.</font>

155
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:54,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo-hoo!</font>

156
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:55,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

157
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:01,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And 1, 2, 3 gumballs
right on cue.</font>

158
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I love it
when she glitches.</font>

159
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:09,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh! Huh.</font>

160
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:11,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.
I must have fallen asleep.</font>

161
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, fun. I'm winning.</font>

162
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:17,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Vanellope takes a huge lead.</i></font>

163
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:20,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No one's gonna catch her now.</i></font>

164
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's gonna love this.</font>

165
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:29,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right on time.</font>

166
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:32,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

167
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:34,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Looking for something new...</font>

168
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and different?</font>

169
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:40,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Then take this track."</font>

170
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:42,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Ralph,
you old son-of-a-gun.</font>

171
00:07:42,164 --> 00:07:44,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd say I got a little time
for a detour.</font>

172
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:46,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

173
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:48,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, look, I think
I unlocked a new track.</font>

174
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:51,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never seen that before.</font>

175
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is awesome!</font>

176
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:57,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, thanks, Ralph!</font>

177
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:59,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome!</font>

178
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:00,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back up
on the track, Swati.</font>

179
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:02,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to lose.</font>

180
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:04,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't.
It's like it's driving itself.</font>

181
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:09,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

182
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:11,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is wrong with
this thing?</font>

183
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:14,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

184
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:22,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no!</font>

185
00:08:22,604 --> 00:08:23,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kid!</font>

186
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:32,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, no, no, no!</font>

187
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:34,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kid! Kid!</font>

188
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, kid, I'm so sorry,
are you okay?</font>

189
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh.</font>

190
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What an amazing track!</font>

191
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:42,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Ralph! Thank you,
thank you, thank you!</font>

192
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome!</font>

193
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:46,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I take my duty
as your hero very seriously.</font>

194
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:48,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.</font>

195
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You took a serious
doody where?</font>

196
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:53,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vanellope, get up here.</font>

197
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:55,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a situation.</font>

198
00:08:56,338 --> 00:09:00,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Litwak, the Vanellope
racer wasn't working...</font>

199
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:03,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I think maybe I
turned the wheel too hard.</font>

200
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:05,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Whoa.
- I'm real sorry.</font>

201
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:06,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, Swati.</font>

202
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:08,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I can get it back
on there pretty easy.</font>

203
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:10,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did you do, Ralph?
- Nothing.</font>

204
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:11,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave him alone.</font>

205
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:13,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was just trying to
make the game more exciting.</font>

206
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:16,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, why don't you relax,
Taffyta? Litwak will fix it.</font>

207
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, on you...</font>

208
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:20,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

209
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:22,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Still not a problem.</font>

210
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:23,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll just order a new part.</font>

211
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'd order a new part...</font>

212
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:26,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the company
that made Sugar Rush</font>

213
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:28,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">went out of business
years ago.</font>

214
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:30,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can try to find one
on the Internet.</font>

215
00:09:30,906 --> 00:09:32,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good idea.
- Oh, me too.</font>

216
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:33,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck, that'll be like
finding a needle in a...</font>

217
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:35,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found one! On ebay!</font>

218
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:37,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? How about that?</font>

219
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:39,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? Those kids
have it under control.</font>

220
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:41,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're just gonna get
another wheel from the eboy.</font>

221
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:43,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you
kidding me? How much?</font>

222
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:45,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's more than this game
makes in a year.</font>

223
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:47,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, I hate to say it,</font>

224
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:49,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but my salvage guy
is coming on Friday...</font>

225
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:52,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it might be time to sell
Sugar Rush for parts.</font>

226
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:55,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Aww.
- Where's he going?</font>

227
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Litwak's gonna
unplug the game.</font>

228
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of here!
Go, scram, let's go, run!</font>

229
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, run, run,
run, run!</font>

230
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:00,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's go!
- Run!</font>

231
00:10:08,744 --> 00:10:10,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gangway!</font>

232
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:11,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah,
you heard him, gangway!</font>

233
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it! No running!</font>

234
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:15,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you people doing
out of your game,</font>

235
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:16,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for Peter's sake?</font>

236
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:18,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The arcade is open!</font>

237
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:20,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sugar Rush</i>
is getting unplugged.</font>

238
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:30,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're homeless!
- Yeah, yeah, we're homeless!</font>

239
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:32,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, what are we going to do?</font>

240
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:36,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Y'all, calm down, calm down.
Get a hold of yourselves.</font>

241
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:37,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to be gameless.</font>

242
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:41,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An unplugging.
Good Lord.</font>

243
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't seen
this many gameless characters</font>

244
00:10:43,112 --> 00:10:45,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">since Space Invaders
went down.</font>

245
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:46,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

246
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are we gonna live?</font>

247
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:51,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you can stay here until
the arcade closes, I guess...</font>

248
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:52,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then we'll figure out</font>

249
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:54,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where the heck
we're gonna put you all.</font>

250
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:10,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

251
00:11:11,474 --> 00:11:13,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

252
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:14,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I raided Gene's fridge.</font>

253
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:16,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good news, he's got pie.</font>

254
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Took a bunch of his pillows
and junk, too.</font>

255
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:21,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm thinking we make a fort
up here, or like a yurt.</font>

256
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:23,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or we could take
these pillows...</font>

257
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:24,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we stack them right,</font>

258
00:11:24,853 --> 00:11:26,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can make an igloo
out of pillows.</font>

259
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:30,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a pillow igloo.
Pigloo. Pigloo!</font>

260
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what do you think, kid?</font>

261
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:34,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fort, yurt, or the obvious
best choice, pigloo?</font>

262
00:11:35,798 --> 00:11:39,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe I don't have
a game anymore.</font>

263
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:42,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, like, what am I
gonna do all day?</font>

264
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:45,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Come on,
are you kidding?</font>

265
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sleep in,
you do no work,</font>

266
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:48,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then you go to Tapper's
with me every night.</font>

267
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:50,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've literally
just described paradise.</font>

268
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:52,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I loved my game.</font>

269
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:53,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on.</font>

270
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were just bellyaching
about the tracks</font>

271
00:11:55,118 --> 00:11:56,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">being too easy.</font>

272
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:58,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that doesn't mean
I didn't love it.</font>

273
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:02,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, sure,
it was kind of predictable...</font>

274
00:12:02,192 --> 00:12:06,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but still I never really knew
what might happen in a race.</font>

275
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:08,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's that,
it's that feeling,</font>

276
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:11,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that not-knowing-what's-
coming-next feeling.</font>

277
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:15,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the stuff.
That feels like life to me.</font>

278
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if I'm not a racer,
Ralph...</font>

279
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:22,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what am I?</font>

280
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:23,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you're my best friend.</font>

281
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:24,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not enough.</font>

282
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:26,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

283
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:27,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I just...</font>

284
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:30,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry,
I know I'm being weird.</font>

285
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:36,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think maybe I just need
to be alone right now.</font>

286
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:37,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

287
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:41,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

288
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:43,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll meet you over at Tapper's
in a little while, I guess.</font>

289
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:46,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want.</font>

290
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:50,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All right, now...</i></font>

291
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:51,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>we found some good homes</i></font>

292
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:53,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>for so many of our chums</i>
from Sugar Rush...</i></font>

293
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we're just hoping
a few more of you</font>

294
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:56,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will open your doors...</font>

295
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:58,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and your hearts
to those in need.</font>

296
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:01,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I suppose
that large green olive</font>

297
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:02,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will fit in nicely
with my decor.</font>

298
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:05,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a sour ball.</font>

299
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:07,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, beggars can't be
choosers, can they?</font>

300
00:13:07,924 --> 00:13:09,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come along, condiment.</font>

301
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-kay.</font>

302
00:13:11,227 --> 00:13:14,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marvelous.
That just leaves the racers.</font>

303
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:16,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're, like, adorable.</font>

304
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure are.</font>

305
00:13:18,368 --> 00:13:20,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, any takers?</font>

306
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:24,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

307
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:26,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone?</font>

308
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:32,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Felix, I know
we've never once talked about</font>

309
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:34,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">having a family before, but...</font>

310
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:36,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, it feels
like the kind of thing</font>

311
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:37,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you just jump into
with both feet...</font>

312
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:39,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and nary a plan.</font>

313
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:42,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Felix and I will
give them sanctuary.</font>

314
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:44,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I get a quick word
with you two?</font>

315
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:49,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I get it.</font>

316
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've been married
6 years,</font>

317
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:52,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're looking to
spice things up...</font>

318
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:54,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but trust me,
adopting 15 children</font>

319
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:56,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is the wrong kind of spice.</font>

320
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those things
are basically feral.</font>

321
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:03,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pardon me, sir, but those
youngsters are lambs.</font>

322
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lost little lambs in need of
two kind, caring shepherds.</font>

323
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:08,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

324
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:11,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, how hard
can parenting be?</font>

325
00:14:11,522 --> 00:14:13,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You treat the child
like your best friend...</font>

326
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:15,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you give them
everything they want...</font>

327
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:16,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you just love
their little socks off.</font>

328
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, Tammy?</font>

329
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:19,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darn-tootin'.</font>

330
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:21,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

331
00:14:22,332 --> 00:14:23,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come and get it.</font>

332
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:24,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your own candle.</font>

333
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:27,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Mom,
why does your lame TV</font>

334
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">only have one channel?</font>

335
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:31,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well,
hate to say I told ya...</font>

336
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:33,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow!</font>

337
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:45,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Tapper?</font>

338
00:14:45,155 --> 00:14:47,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Ralph.
I haven't seen Vanellope.</font>

339
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:50,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not since the last time
you asked me 30 seconds ago.</font>

340
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:52,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. I'm just
worried about her.</font>

341
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:56,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's glitching like crazy,
and acting super insecure.</font>

342
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. And get this,
she said...</font>

343
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:01,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">being friends with me
wasn't enough for her.</font>

344
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:04,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not enough?
I'm a great friend!</font>

345
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, Tapper? Right?</font>

346
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:08,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
Who's acting insecure?</font>

347
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:09,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralph, come on.</font>

348
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:12,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The kid just lost her game.
Give her a break.</font>

349
00:15:13,484 --> 00:15:15,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you are... Oh.</font>

350
00:15:15,352 --> 00:15:16,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Ralph.</font>

351
00:15:16,454 --> 00:15:19,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Felix. Since when
do you drink root beer?</font>

352
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:20,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since tonight.</font>

353
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:22,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I hear you, buddy.</font>

354
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:24,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, listen. This one was
supposed to be for Vanellope.</font>

355
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:25,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess you can have it.</font>

356
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:27,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't look like
she's coming.</font>

357
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:28,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

358
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:30,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
I can't help but think</font>

359
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:32,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this whole mess
is somehow...</font>

360
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:35,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">partially my fault.</font>

361
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:38,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It figures. Just when
my life was perfect.</font>

362
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:40,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mine was, too.</font>

363
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, hey,
now I'm a father of 15.</font>

364
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:46,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't that just a blessing?</font>

365
00:15:49,753 --> 00:15:53,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eeeee-oh-boy!</font>

366
00:15:53,157 --> 00:15:55,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. What'd
you say, Felix?</font>

367
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:57,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, isn't that
just a blessing?</font>

368
00:15:57,628 --> 00:15:59,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, the weird sound thing.</font>

369
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Eeeee-oh-boy?</font>

370
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Eee-oh...</font>

371
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:04,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, say it again?</font>

372
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:06,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Eeeee-oh-boy.
- Eeeee-oh-boy!</font>

373
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:08,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Eee-oh-boy!
- Eee-boy! Say it again?</font>

374
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:09,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Eeeee-oh-boy!
- Eeeee-oh-boy.</font>

375
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:11,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Eeeee-oh-boy...
- eboy! eboy! eboy!</font>

376
00:16:11,742 --> 00:16:12,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- eboy? eboy?
- eboy.</font>

377
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:14,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

378
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:15,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, what are you getting
at there, Ralph?</font>

379
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That kid out in the arcade</font>

380
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:19,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">said there was
a steering wheel part...</font>

381
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:22,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the Internet, it's
something called eboy or...</font>

382
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:24,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ebay! That's it,
it was ebay!</font>

383
00:16:24,788 --> 00:16:26,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralph, are you thinking about</font>

384
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:28,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">going to the Internet
and finding that part?</font>

385
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:29,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Getting that part's
the only thing</font>

386
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:31,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's gonna fix the game
and that's the only thing</font>

387
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:33,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's gonna make
Vanellope happy again.</font>

388
00:16:33,832 --> 00:16:35,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if Sugar Rush is fixed,</font>

389
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all those lovable scamps
living in my house...</font>

390
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:40,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and destroying my sanity</font>

391
00:16:40,204 --> 00:16:42,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will have homes
of their own again!</font>

392
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralph, this is an important mission.
A noble mission!</font>

393
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:46,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will cover for you.</font>

394
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:48,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, pal.</font>

395
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:51,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralph, what about your tab?
You owe me for the root beer.</font>

396
00:16:51,348 --> 00:16:53,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Felix is gonna
cover for me.</font>

397
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:55,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drinks on the house, everybody!
Felix is paying.</font>

398
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoryuken!</font>

399
00:16:57,856 --> 00:16:59,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eeeee-oh-boy.</font>

400
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:08,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boo!</font>

401
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:10,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralph, what is wrong
with you?</font>

402
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:11,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start churning butter</font>

403
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and put on your church

players like DirtySocks537</font>

804
00:33:42,263 --> 00:33:44,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and BabeRaham_Linkin...</font>

805
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but if we just let them win,</font>

806
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where's the life lesson?
You know?</font>

807
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:52,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mmm.
- Yeah, but to Pyro's point...</font>

808
00:33:52,173 --> 00:33:54,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, those players
work so hard to get here.</font>

809
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:56,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear you, Felony...</font>

810
00:33:56,377 --> 00:33:58,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but imagine a game
without challenges.</font>

811
00:33:58,546 --> 00:34:01,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The same predictable thing
every single time...</font>

812
00:34:01,516 --> 00:34:02,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who wants that?</font>

813
00:34:02,718 --> 00:34:03,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shank's right.</font>

814
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:06,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just saw a really
insightful TED talk...</font>

815
00:34:06,822 --> 00:34:08,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I can't really remember
what the guy said.</font>

816
00:34:08,857 --> 00:34:10,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was more about
how he made me feel.</font>

817
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:13,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I think, ultimately,
the point was...</font>

818
00:34:13,394 --> 00:34:16,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I honor your journeys, guys.</font>

819
00:34:16,564 --> 00:34:18,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we honor yours,
Butcher Boy.</font>

820
00:34:18,634 --> 00:34:19,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

821
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:20,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Shank,</font>

822
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:22,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">did you ever wonder
what it would be like...</font>

823
00:34:22,571 --> 00:34:24,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if someone actually
did get your car?</font>

824
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:25,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I know one thing...</font>

825
00:34:25,908 --> 00:34:28,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whoever does will have to
be the best of the best.</font>

826
00:34:32,246 --> 00:34:34,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good day to you, madam.</font>

827
00:34:34,182 --> 00:34:35,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

828
00:34:35,383 --> 00:34:38,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here from the, uh,
Department of Noise.</font>

829
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:40,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the thing is, we've been
getting some complaints</font>

830
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">down at HQ.</font>

831
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:44,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, Larry's the one
who takes the calls.</font>

832
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:45,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyways, someone told Larry...</font>

833
00:34:45,861 --> 00:34:47,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we've been
hearing a lot of</font>

834
00:34:47,195 --> 00:34:48,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">gun sounds
and screaming sounds...</font>

835
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:50,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and what-have-you.
That sort of thing.</font>

836
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:53,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! This is nice.</font>

837
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:58,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where have you been
all my life?</font>

838
00:34:58,306 --> 00:35:00,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, so I came to
check on things.</font>

839
00:35:00,408 --> 00:35:01,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm sorry, who did
you say you were again?</font>

840
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:04,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm Larry?</font>

841
00:35:04,446 --> 00:35:06,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, you said
Larry took the call.</font>

842
00:35:13,756 --> 00:35:15,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good job, Larry!</font>

843
00:35:15,724 --> 00:35:18,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, worked like a charm!</font>

844
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Are you kidding me?
Someone got Shank's car?</i></font>

845
00:35:26,435 --> 00:35:28,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I need yours. Sorry.</font>

846
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:32,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm just...
I'm just gonna go.</i></font>

847
00:35:35,477 --> 00:35:37,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the worst day
of my life!</font>

848
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:40,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a shame
we have to leave so soon.</font>

849
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:41,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This game is cool.</font>

850
00:35:41,984 --> 00:35:43,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get us out of here</font>

851
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:45,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so we can get this car
to Spamley and get paid.</font>

852
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:46,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No problem.</font>

853
00:35:48,724 --> 00:35:49,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.</font>

854
00:35:49,892 --> 00:35:51,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this guy
coming in hot.</font>

855
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:10,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mess with the bull, you
get the horns, little girl!</font>

856
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:16,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still have value,
Butcher Boy.</font>

857
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:22,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no!
It's that Shank lady.</font>

858
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:23,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She looks upset.</font>

859
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:26,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, don't worry,
I'll lose her.</font>

860
00:36:34,837 --> 00:36:36,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going?</font>

861
00:36:36,472 --> 00:36:38,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kid, get back on the track.
I'm gonna lose my cookies.</font>

862
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:41,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no track.
I can drive anywhere.</font>

863
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

864
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:58,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, kid, she's coming up
right behind us.</font>

865
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:00,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hello!</font>

866
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:02,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe you have
something of mine.</font>

867
00:37:02,364 --> 00:37:03,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, come and get it.</font>

868
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh!</font>

869
00:37:18,747 --> 00:37:20,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This girl can drive.</font>

870
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you hurry up
and lose her?</font>

871
00:37:33,129 --> 00:37:34,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying!</font>

872
00:37:35,832 --> 00:37:37,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on, chumbo!</font>

873
00:37:44,107 --> 00:37:45,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like this!</font>

874
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! Mother Hubbard,
this lady can really drive.</font>

875
00:38:00,723 --> 00:38:02,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kid, fire!
Do you see the fire?</font>

876
00:38:02,591 --> 00:38:03,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dead end! Dead end!</font>

877
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not for me. Bye-bye, Shanky.</font>

878
00:38:07,797 --> 00:38:09,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo-hoo!</font>

879
00:38:09,065 --> 00:38:10,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, yeah!
- That's the stuff.</font>

880
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:11,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good job, kid.</font>

881
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:14,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah,
I feel like me again.</font>

882
00:38:14,771 --> 00:38:16,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One exit straight ahead.</font>

883
00:38:35,524 --> 00:38:36,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not gonna lose me
that easy.</font>

884
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:37,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you...?</font>

885
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:39,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, you might wanna keep
your eyes on the road.</font>

886
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:40,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kid!</font>

887
00:38:48,004 --> 00:38:51,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, Department of Noise,
get out of my car!</font>

888
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:53,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man,
what are we gonna do?</font>

889
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:55,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just stay put,
don't panic.</font>

890
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:56,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna talk to her.</font>

891
00:38:56,179 --> 00:38:57,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralph, be careful.</font>

892
00:38:57,714 --> 00:39:00,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fine.
This is what heroes do.</font>

893
00:39:03,486 --> 00:39:04,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My bottom is stuck.</font>

894
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:10,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This car is not designed
for a big boy.</font>

895
00:39:10,627 --> 00:39:12,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you that. Hi.</font>

896
00:39:12,495 --> 00:39:14,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys really thought
you could just steal my car?</font>

897
00:39:14,998 --> 00:39:17,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, let me tell you
what's gonna happen now.</font>

898
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:20,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, wait, listen. We aren't
normally car thieves.</font>

899
00:39:20,136 --> 00:39:23,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friend here,
she's a candy kart racer.</font>

900
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should see her
racing around</font>

901
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:26,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">her sweet little track...</font>

902
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:27,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in her cookie wafer car
we built together.</font>

903
00:39:29,112 --> 00:39:33,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, well, the thing is, her
perfect little game broke...</font>

904
00:39:33,783 --> 00:39:35,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it was my fault...</font>

905
00:39:35,785 --> 00:39:37,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so we're here
to try to fix it...</font>

906
00:39:37,954 --> 00:39:39,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we need money to do that,</font>

907
00:39:39,122 --> 00:39:40,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and someone was
gonna pay us money...</font>

908
00:39:40,857 --> 00:39:42,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- to steal your car...
- Okay, okay.</font>

909
00:39:42,558 --> 00:39:44,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...and so we took it.
- You can stop crying.</font>

910
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:45,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Though I do respect</font>

911
00:39:45,862 --> 00:39:47,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your wonderful display
of vulnerability.</font>

912
00:39:47,563 --> 00:39:49,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

913
00:39:49,266 --> 00:39:51,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it, I do.</font>

914
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:53,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friendship is
everything to us, too.</font>

915
00:39:53,703 --> 00:39:56,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right, guys?
- Word. We're like family.</font>

916
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:57,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's really great.</font>

917
00:39:57,874 --> 00:39:59,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, does this mean
we can keep your car?</font>

918
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:02,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely not.
But I do want to help.</font>

919
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:04,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you got
your phone on you?</font>

920
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:06,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know it.
- Let's make a video.</font>

921
00:40:06,182 --> 00:40:08,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pyro, hit big boy
with the blow and go.</font>

922
00:40:08,285 --> 00:40:09,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd love to.</font>

923
00:40:09,552 --> 00:40:10,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. What's the...?</font>

924
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:13,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

925
00:40:13,656 --> 00:40:15,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say something, first thing
that comes to your mind.</font>

926
00:40:16,592 --> 00:40:19,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna wreck it!</font>

927
00:40:19,196 --> 00:40:21,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. All right.
Turn it off.</font>

928
00:40:21,298 --> 00:40:23,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow.</font>

929
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:25,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the heck
did you do that for?</font>

930
00:40:25,202 --> 00:40:26,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

931
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:29,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are much better ways
to make money on the Internet</font>

932
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than stealing cars...</font>

933
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">such as becoming
a BuzzzTube star.</font>

934
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:35,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I supposed to know
what that is?</font>

935
00:40:35,945 --> 00:40:38,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on.
Everybody knows BuzzzTube.</font>

936
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:40,115

00:40:40,117 --> 00:40:41,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just starting
your account...</font>

938
00:40:41,818 --> 00:40:44,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, there you go.</font>

939
00:40:44,154 --> 00:40:47,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If this thing goes viral,
you can make a lot of money.</font>

940
00:40:47,924 --> 00:40:50,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A friend of mine,
chick named Yesss...</font>

941
00:40:50,027 --> 00:40:51,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she's the head algorithm
over there.</font>

942
00:40:51,928 --> 00:40:53,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell her I sent you.</font>

943
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:54,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yesss will hook you up.</font>

944
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:56,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, that's really nice
of you.</font>

945
00:40:56,966 --> 00:40:58,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure if "nice"
is the right word.</font>

946
00:40:58,935 --> 00:41:00,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, thank you.</font>

947
00:41:00,837 --> 00:41:02,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should be thanking you,
little sister.</font>

948
00:41:02,206 --> 00:41:03,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That race was fun.</font>

949
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:05,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

950
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:06,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, thank you again.</font>

951
00:41:07,044 --> 00:41:08,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... You know...</font>

952
00:41:08,078 --> 00:41:10,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While we're talking shop,
what move did you do</font>

953
00:41:10,981 --> 00:41:12,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to get through
that tunnel of fire?</font>

954
00:41:12,915 --> 00:41:15,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was it a power drift into
a drift jump, maybe, or...?</font>

955
00:41:15,618 --> 00:41:17,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>

956
00:41:17,154 --> 00:41:19,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you ever wanna come back
for a rematch...</font>

957
00:41:19,256 --> 00:41:21,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be happy
to kick your butt again.</font>

958
00:41:21,158 --> 00:41:22,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you.</font>

959
00:41:36,806 --> 00:41:37,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

960
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:39,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show-off.</font>

961
00:41:40,277 --> 00:41:42,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, oh, man,
that place was scary.</font>

962
00:41:42,846 --> 00:41:45,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.
It was so exciting!</font>

963
00:41:45,015 --> 00:41:46,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, exciting is
when you smile.</font>

964
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:48,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scary is when
you clench your butt,</font>

965
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:50,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and my butt
is still clenched.</font>

966
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:52,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on, are you
honestly telling me...</font>

967
00:41:52,322 --> 00:41:55,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Shank lady wasn't the
coolest person you ever met?</font>

968
00:41:55,658 --> 00:41:58,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool? Name one cool thing
about her.</font>

969
00:41:58,162 --> 00:42:00,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, let's see, she looks
cool, she talks cool...</font>

970
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:02,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she drives cool, her hair
is cool, her car is cool...</font>

971
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:05,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute, are you
saying my hair isn't cool?</font>

972
00:42:05,002 --> 00:42:09,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No! I'm just saying
the game was next-level.</font>

973
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:11,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was no one telling you
what to do or where to go.</font>

974
00:42:11,842 --> 00:42:14,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, just where do you think
you're going?</font>

975
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:16,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To BuzzzTube.
It's this way.</font>

976
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. We're going
back to Spamley's.</font>

977
00:42:18,348 --> 00:42:20,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He can give us
some easier loot to find.</font>

978
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:23,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we're supposed to
see Shank's friend.</font>

979
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:25,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on. I don't trust
that Shank one bit.</font>

980
00:42:25,756 --> 00:42:27,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, I do.
- Well, I...</font>

981
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:29,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello, mister.
- Who are you?</font>

982
00:42:29,893 --> 00:42:31,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm your friendly
ebay alert messenger.</font>

983
00:42:31,795 --> 00:42:34,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh. An actual eboy.</font>

984
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:37,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just here to let you know your
bid expires in 8 hours.</font>

985
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:40,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">8 hours.
Okay, thanks, eboy.</font>

986
00:42:40,704 --> 00:42:42,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it, Jackson!</font>

987
00:42:42,339 --> 00:42:46,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chumbo, if we nickel-and-dime
it with Spamley...</font>

988
00:42:46,243 --> 00:42:48,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it will take 20 years</font>

989
00:42:48,078 --> 00:42:49,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to make enough money
to buy the wheel.</font>

990
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:52,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, fine.
We'll do it your way.</font>

991
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:54,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm telling you right now,
that BuzzzTube place</font>

992
00:42:54,751 --> 00:42:56,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a terrible idea.</font>

993
00:43:03,427 --> 00:43:06,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, there are all kinds of
videos in here.</font>

994
00:43:06,897 --> 00:43:09,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, if you like
babies and cats.</font>

995
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:11,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look, there's you!
- Oh, yeah.</font>

996
00:43:11,235 --> 00:43:12,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm gonna wreck it!</i></font>

997
00:43:15,706 --> 00:43:17,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder
why those little guys</font>

998
00:43:17,107 --> 00:43:18,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are giving your video
all those hearts?</font>

999
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:20,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because obviously
they love me.</font>

1000
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you this place
was a good idea.</font>

1001
00:43:22,346 --> 00:43:24,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah,
sure you did, doof.</font>

1002
00:43:24,214 --> 00:43:26,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, who we supposed to see
about getting paid again?</font>

1003
00:43:26,783 --> 00:43:30,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The head algorithm.
Her name is Yesss.</font>

1004
00:43:30,087 --> 00:43:32,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No. No.</font>

1005
00:43:32,756 --> 00:43:35,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uninspired, cliched...</font>

1006
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:37,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh! YouTube's got this one.</font>

1007
00:43:37,294 --> 00:43:39,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chewbacca Dad? Really?</font>

1008
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:43,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's like Chewbacca Mom,
but it's a daddy.</font>

1009
00:43:43,233 --> 00:43:44,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1010
00:43:44,768 --> 00:43:47,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heyo! Are you
the head of Al Gore?</font>

1011
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:51,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am the head algorithm
of BuzzzTube...</font>

1012
00:43:51,775 --> 00:43:53,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which means
I curate the content...</font>

1013
00:43:53,478 --> 00:43:56,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the Internet's most
popular video-sharing site.</font>

1014
00:43:56,347 --> 00:43:58,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which means, I don't
have time to trifle...</font>

1015
00:43:58,115 --> 00:44:00,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with every shoeless,
mouth-breathing hobo</font>

1016
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:02,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that trundles
into my office.</font>

1017

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call security, Maybe.</font>

1018
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:07,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. But, Yesss,
this is the leaf blower guy.</font>

1019
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:08,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who?</font>

1020
00:44:08,293 --> 00:44:09,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The man
with the undulating jowls.</font>

1021
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:11,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So?</font>

1022
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:13,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His video has
1.3 million hearts.</font>

1023
00:44:13,797 --> 00:44:15,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well!</font>

1024
00:44:15,466 --> 00:44:17,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you tell me</font>

1025
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:19,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was in the presence
of a genius?</font>

1026
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab him a drink.</font>

1027
00:44:21,406 --> 00:44:23,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, this lady
named Shank...</font>

1028
00:44:23,006 --> 00:44:24,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she actually made the video.</font>

1029
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:26,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's the one who told us
to come see you.</font>

1030
00:44:26,477 --> 00:44:28,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No wonder
your video's so dope.</font>

1031
00:44:28,812 --> 00:44:30,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shank is for real cool.</font>

1032
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:31,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>

1033
00:44:31,815 --> 00:44:33,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She is not.</font>

1034
00:44:33,184 --> 00:44:35,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the cool one
getting all the hearts.</font>

1035
00:44:35,153 --> 00:44:38,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's right,
you big baby.</font>

1036
00:44:39,022 --> 00:44:40,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1037
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:41,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, what'd you say
your name was?</font>

1038
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralph, Wreck-It Ralph.</font>

1039
00:44:43,026 --> 00:44:46,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Wreck-It Ralph,
you are trending!</font>

1043
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:58,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, not to buzzkill
the lovefest</font>

1044
00:44:58,042 --> 00:44:59,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you guys got going on here...</font>

1045
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but Shank kinda
told us that</font>

1046
00:45:01,379 --> 00:45:04,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">viral videos can make,
like, actual money?</font>

1047
00:45:04,848 --> 00:45:06,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hearts are money, honey.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Buzzzy account converts
hearts into dollars.</font>

1051
00:45:12,323 --> 00:45:15,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kid, we only needed $27,001.
We're done.</font>

1052
00:45:15,293 --> 00:45:18,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, no.</font>

1053
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:20,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's $43.</font>

1054
00:45:20,198 --> 00:45:24,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">43? That's not even
half of 27,001.</font>

1055
00:45:24,235 --> 00:45:27,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we only have
8 hours left to save my game.</font>

1056
00:45:27,538 --> 00:45:30,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh. Well, I hate to say it,
but that ain't happening.</font>

1057
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:32,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your video is tapped out.</font>

1058
00:45:32,176 --> 00:45:33,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I thought
I was trenching?</font>

1059

1064
00:45:43,154 --> 00:45:44,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are we gonna do, kid?</font>

1065
00:45:44,389 --> 00:45:47,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, pal, I have
an idea. And hear me out.</font>

1066
00:45:47,325 --> 00:45:50,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if we go back
to Slaughter Race</font>

1067

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to miss you.</font>

1196
00:51:06,311 --> 00:51:08,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be fine, too.</font>

1197
00:51:08,581 --> 00:51:10,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The more hearts
your videos get,</font>

1198
00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:12,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the faster
we'll get the wheel.</font>

1199
00:51:12,317 --> 00:51:13,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then we can go home.</font>

1200
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, we'll be celebrating</font>

1201
00:51:15,454 --> 00:51:17,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at Tapper's this time
tomorrow, buddy.</font>

1202
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:20,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I guess you're right.</font>

1203
00:51:21,226 --> 00:51:22,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye!</font>

1204
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:25,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be careful, huh?
Don't be a dummy.</font>

1205
00:51:29,602 --> 00:51:31,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So where exactly
are you sending her?</font>

1206
00:51:31,604 --> 00:51:33,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since candy girl
comes from an arcade game...</font>

1207
00:51:33,873 --> 00:51:35,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm thinking she'd be good
in the gaming district.</font>

1208
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:38,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, no, no.
Bad idea.</font>

1209
00:51:38,945 --> 00:51:41,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those games are dangerous,
and they rot your brain.</font>

1210
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:42,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't we
send her somewhere</font>

1211
00:51:42,882 --> 00:51:45,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a little more totally
different than that...</font>

1212
00:51:45,551 --> 00:51:47,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and nowhere near there?</font>

1213
00:51:47,954 --> 00:51:51,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see.
Family Friendly Fansites.</font>

1214
00:51:51,223 --> 00:51:53,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That sounds safe, and she is
technically a princess...</font>

1215
00:51:53,459 --> 00:51:55,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so how about this one here</font>

1216
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:56,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the sweet little
pink castle?</font>

1217
00:51:56,929 --> 00:51:58,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love it.</font>

1218

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez Louise, this place
is bonkers! Whoa!</font>

and cartoon characters?</font>

1223
00:52:26,959 --> 00:52:29,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, easy there.</font>

1224
00:52:29,662 --> 00:52:31,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I mean,
no offense or anything.</font>

1225
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:34,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, time to get to work.</font>

1226
00:52:34,967 --> 00:52:36,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And for your final question.</font>

1227
00:52:36,502 --> 00:52:39,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"My friends
would describe me as?"</font>

1228
00:52:39,572 --> 00:52:42,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Smart, funny,
kind, or brave."</i></font>

1230
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:46,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kind, I guess?</font>

1231
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:50,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Based on your answers,
your princess BFF is</font>

1277
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,059

if you haven't.</font>

1278
00:54:41,962 --> 00:54:44,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh. What kind of
a princess are you?</font>

1279
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind?</font>

1280

Should I call the police?</font>

1287

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I have to assume
you made a deal</font>

sea witch...</font>

1290
00:55:00,948 --> 00:55:03,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in exchange
for a pair of human legs?</font>

1291
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:05,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! Good Lord,
who would do that?</font>

1292
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:07,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever had
True Love's Kiss?</font>

1293

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ew! Barf!</font>

1294

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither do we!</font>

1297
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:15,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now for
the million-dollar question.</font>

1298
00:55:15,428 --> 00:55:17,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do people assume
all your problems got solved</font>

1299
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:19,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because a big strong man
showed up?</font>

1300
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:21,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! What is up with that?</font>

1301
00:55:21,969 --> 00:55:23,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She is a princess!</font>

1302
00:55:24,972 --> 00:55:26,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who made your gown?</font>

1303
00:55:26,673 --> 00:55:28,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen
anything quite like it.</font>

1304

1305
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:31,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'd so love to
have one of my own.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh! I want one, too,
you guys!</font>

1309
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get my mice on this.</font>

1310
00:55:40,187 --> 00:55:42,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So this is love.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">All hail Princess Vanellope,
the queen of comfy!</font>

1316
00:55:55,469 --> 00:55:57,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah. Shirt.</font>

1317
00:55:57,905 --> 00:56:01,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> I once had a dream

Wait! What's going on?</font>

1319
00:56:04,511 --> 00:56:06,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, she's singing.</font>

1320
00:56:06,013 --> 00:56:09,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but there was like music
and a spotlight.</font>

1321
00:56:09,182 --> 00:56:11,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, you all
saw it too, right?</font>

1322
00:56:11,018 --> 00:56:12,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what happens</font>

1323
00:56:12,219 --> 00:56:14,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when a princess
sings about her dreams.</font>

to me. I mean, not even once.</font>

1325
00:56:17,824 --> 00:56:19,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you give it
a try?</font>

1326
00:56:19,726 --> 00:56:22,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it you really want?
Sing about that.</font>

1327
00:56:22,696 --> 00:56:24,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Uh, sure.</font>

1328
00:56:24,164 --> 00:56:25,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh. I could do that.
Um, let's see.</font>

1329
00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:32,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Oh, steering wheel
Oh, steering wheel</i></font>

1330
00:56:32,706 --> 00:56:36,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Oh, yes
I want a steering wheel </i></font>

1331
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there is a lot
to unpack here.</font>

1332
00:56:41,515 --> 00:56:42,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-hmm.</font>

1333
00:56:42,849 --> 00:56:45,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, this steering wheel
you sing of,</font>

1334
00:56:45,185 --> 00:56:46,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's a metaphor?</font>

1335
00:56:46,787 --> 00:56:48,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, no, it's not
a metaphor. I just...</font>

1336
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I literally want
a steering wheel.</font>

1337
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:53,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think the issue is
I was a little pitchy.</font>

1338
00:56:53,794 --> 00:56:55,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe a little.</font>

1339
00:56:55,229 --> 00:56:58,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But sometimes
your song can't start...</font>

1340
00:56:58,632 --> 00:57:00,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until you go someplace
to reflect.</font>

1341
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:03,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What works for some of us...</font>

1342
00:57:03,237 --> 00:57:06,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is finding a form of water
and staring at it.</font>

1343
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:08,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1344
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:11,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes, I like to stare
at a wishing well!</font>

1345
00:57:11,212 --> 00:57:12,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I stare at the ocean.</font>

1346
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:13,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Horse trough.</font>

1347
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soap bubbles!</font>

1348
00:57:14,915 --> 00:57:17,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, you're saying if I just
stare at some water...</font>

1349
00:57:18,286 --> 00:57:20,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, important water.</font>

1350
00:57:20,088 --> 00:57:22,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Of course.
"Important water."</font>

1351
00:57:22,923 --> 00:57:25,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I stare at
the important water...</font>

1352
00:57:25,259 --> 00:57:28,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and somehow magically I'll
start singing about my dream?</font>

1353
00:57:28,595 --> 00:57:29,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- For sure.
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

1354
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:32,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, yeah, I don't think so,
ladies, but thanks.</font>

1355
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 minutes,
Princesses.</font>

1356
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:38,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another "Which Disney Princess
Are You?" quizlet</font>

1357
00:57:38,272 --> 00:57:39,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">starts in 5 minutes.</font>

1358
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:42,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, thank you.</font>

1359
00:57:42,276 --> 00:57:45,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I guess it's back
to the gowns, girls.</font>

1360
00:57:45,313 --> 00:57:47,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was lovely to meet you,
Vanellope.</font>

1361
00:57:47,581 --> 00:57:49,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And best of luck
finding your song.</font>

1362
00:57:56,257 --> 00:57:57,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh.</font>

1363
00:57:57,992 --> 00:57:59,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did she just say?</font>

1364
00:57:59,293 --> 00:58:01,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't know.
We can't understand her.</font>

1365
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:02,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's from
the other studio.</font>

1366
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:04,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>

1367
00:58:04,664 --> 00:58:06,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, everybody.
Wreck-It Ralph here...</font>

1368
00:58:06,867 --> 00:58:09,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a little box
I'm gonna open.</font>

1369
00:58:09,603 --> 00:58:11,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see what we got here.</font>

1370
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:14,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A "Pancake Milkshake
Fun Set." Huh.</font>

1371
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:15,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got a little heft to it.</font>

1372
00:58:15,877 --> 00:58:17,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something wobbling
around in there.</font>

1373
00:58:17,677 --> 00:58:19,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wonder if we got
the kitty or the bunny.</font>

1374
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:20,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's open it up.</font>

1375
00:58:24,718 --> 00:58:26,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, who would've
guessed a bee pun</font>

1376
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would be the thing
to put us over the top?</font>

1377
00:58:28,289 --> 00:58:30,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh. That's the Internet
for you.</font>

1378
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:33,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, it is uploading.</font>

1379
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:34,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, mister!</font>

1380
00:58:34,328 --> 00:58:35,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Hi, eboy.</font>

1381
00:58:35,695 --> 00:58:36,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just here to let you know</font>

1382
00:58:36,964 --> 00:58:39,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your bid does expire
in 30 minutes.</font>

1383
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:41,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, little eboy.</font>

1384
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:42,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it, chairman.</font>

1385
00:58:43,371 --> 00:58:44,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hear that, Yesss?</font>

1386
00:58:44,704 --> 00:58:46,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have
a lot of time left.</font>

1387
00:58:46,174 --> 00:58:47,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. We just gotta...</font>

1388
00:58:47,341 --> 00:58:49,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.</font>

1389
00:58:49,676 --> 00:58:51,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! Not you!</font>

1390
00:58:51,379 --> 00:58:53,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Why are you
angry at the lollipop?</font>

1391
00:58:53,047 --> 00:58:54,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does that mean?</font>

1392
00:58:54,215 --> 00:58:55,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The file's not loading.</font>

1393
00:58:55,817 --> 00:58:57,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If this doesn't load,
we're not gonna make it.</font>

1394
00:58:57,752 --> 00:59:00,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hmm.
- You don't have enough hearts.</font>

1395
00:59:00,654 --> 00:59:02,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralph, where are you going?</font>

1396
00:59:02,023 --> 00:59:03,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going down to the floor
to get some hearts.</font>

1397
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:05,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah! Genius! Good thinking.</font>

1398
00:59:05,193 --> 00:59:07,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, someone get me
tech support in here, stat!</font>

1399
00:59:11,332 --> 00:59:13,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only one person.</font>

1400
00:59:13,234 --> 00:59:14,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys, come and
check out my video,</font>

1401
00:59:14,735 --> 00:59:15,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're gonna love it.</font>

1402
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:18,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, right over here.
Yep, here we go.</font>

1403
00:59:18,706 --> 00:59:20,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you...
You guys!</font>

1404
00:59:20,341 --> 00:59:22,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw. A cat?</font>

1405
00:59:22,243 --> 00:59:26,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna like this better
than some dusty old cat.</font>

1406
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:28,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw.</font>

1407
00:59:28,216 --> 00:59:29,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1408
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:31,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that hose, partner.</font>

1409
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:34,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know you love me, give me those hearts.
There we go.</font>

1410
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:37,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, folks, where are you going?
Give my video a heart.</font>

1411
00:59:37,391 --> 00:59:40,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.
Let's see who's in here.</font>

1412
00:59:40,728 --> 00:59:41,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

1413
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:44,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody in here?</font>

1414
00:59:47,101 --> 00:59:49,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the heck is this place?</font>

1415
00:59:50,771 --> 00:59:52,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some kind of libary?</font>

1416
00:59:53,941 --> 00:59:56,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Wreck-It Ralph is back."</font>

1417
00:59:56,043 --> 00:59:58,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, they're talking about me.</font>

1418
00:59:58,746 --> 01:00:01,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gee whiz,
the Internet is so positive.</font>

1419
01:00:01,816 --> 01:00:04,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Fix-It Felix, Jr.</i>
was my favorite game."</font>

1420
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:06,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm. Mine, too.</font>

1421
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Ralph's videos stink."</font>

1422
01:00:08,956 --> 01:00:10,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1423
01:00:10,091 --> 01:00:12,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"So stupid."</font>

1424
01:00:12,126 --> 01:00:14,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Ralph is the worst."</font>

1425
01:00:15,363 --> 01:00:17,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I hate him."</font>

1426
01:00:17,965 --> 01:00:20,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"He's so fat and ugly."</font>

1427
01:00:23,004 --> 01:00:27,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Just a worthless bum,
alone on a pile of bricks."</font>

1428
01:00:34,449 --> 01:00:37,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, Ralph,
you in here, dude?</font>

1429
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:38,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I got to show you...</font>

1430
01:00:40,087 --> 01:00:41,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1431
01:00:42,023 --> 01:00:44,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First rule
of the Internet...</font>

1432
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:47,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do not read the comments.</font>

1433
01:00:47,028 --> 01:00:48,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should have told you that.</font>

1434
01:00:49,398 --> 01:00:50,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>

1435
01:00:50,532 --> 01:00:53,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This place can bring out
the worst in some people...</font>

1436
01:00:53,834 --> 01:00:55,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you gotta ignore all this.</font>

1437
01:00:55,437 --> 01:00:58,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't about you, Ralph.
It's about them.</font>

1438
01:00:58,839 --> 01:01:00,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care.
It's fine.</font>

1439
01:01:02,444 --> 01:01:05,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People hated me my whole life
for being the bad guy.</font>

1440
01:01:06,448 --> 01:01:08,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a good reminder</font>

1441
01:01:08,049 --> 01:01:09,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that this is the only heart</font>

1442
01:01:09,418 --> 01:01:10,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that really matters.</font>

1443
01:01:11,118 --> 01:01:12,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vanellope gave me this...</font>

1444
01:01:12,853 --> 01:01:14,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and as long as she likes me...</font>

1445
01:01:14,289 --> 01:01:16,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need anybody else.</font>

1446
01:01:16,124 --> 01:01:17,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I sure
don't need the Internet.</font>

1447
01:01:17,792 --> 01:01:19,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on.</font>

1448
01:01:19,261 --> 01:01:21,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not all bad.</font>

1449
01:01:21,296 --> 01:01:23,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Internet
can also be a place...</font>

1450
01:01:23,298 --> 01:01:25,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where you find a steering
wheel at one website...</font>

1451
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and make enough money
to buy it at another one.</font>

1452
01:01:29,137 --> 01:01:31,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations, Ralph.
You did it.</font>

1453
01:01:31,273 --> 01:01:32,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, really?</font>

1454
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:34,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, check your
Buzzzy account.</font>

1455
01:01:34,909 --> 01:01:37,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You needed 27K,
you got over 30 grand!</font>

1456
01:01:37,878 --> 01:01:39,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh!</font>

1457
01:01:39,114 --> 01:01:40,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is great!</font>

1458
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:42,482

<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's the thing,
I want this to be my normal.</font>

1591
01:08:22,385 --> 01:08:24,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want this to be my life.</font>

1592
01:08:25,287 --> 01:08:26,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't go home now.</font>

1593
01:08:28,692 --> 01:08:29,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't.</font>

1594
01:08:38,267 --> 01:08:39,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

1595
01:08:40,302 --> 01:08:41,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
where I come from,</font>

1596
01:08:41,405 --> 01:08:43,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's called
a kick in the face.</font>

1597
01:08:43,707 --> 01:08:45,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe it.</font>

1598
01:08:45,642 --> 01:08:48,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A straight-up donkey kick
to the teeth.</font>

1599
01:08:48,612 --> 01:08:50,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's supposed to be
my best friend.</font>

1600
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, this can't be right.</font>

1601
01:08:53,984 --> 01:08:55,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, she's been brainwashed.</font>

1602
01:08:55,819 --> 01:08:57,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what this is.</font>

1603
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because the Vanellope I know</font>

1604
01:08:58,355 --> 01:08:59,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would never abandon me
like that.</font>

1605
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:01,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta get her out
of there now.</font>

1606
01:09:01,558 --> 01:09:03,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, easy now, tiger.</font>

1607
01:09:03,827 --> 01:09:04,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I admire the impulse...</font>

1608
01:09:04,961 --> 01:09:07,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you charge in there
like some white knight...</font>

1609
01:09:07,497 --> 01:09:08,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she's liable to hold it
against you.</font>

1610
01:09:08,999 --> 01:09:11,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what? I'm supposed to
just let her stay in a game</font>

1611
01:09:11,435 --> 01:09:12,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's obviously bad for her?</font>

1612
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:13,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course not.</font>

1613
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:15,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then how do I make her leave?</font>

1614
01:09:15,706 --> 01:09:18,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She thinks it's so cool
and exciting in there.</font>

1615
01:09:18,809 --> 01:09:22,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless you know how I can
make the game boring or...</font>

1616
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:26,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. You know about viruses
and stuff, right, Spamley?</font>

1617
01:09:26,483 --> 01:09:28,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who's asking?
- Whoa.</font>

1618
01:09:28,452 --> 01:09:29,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back home, me and the kid</font>

1619
01:09:29,786 --> 01:09:32,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">used to goof off
in this game called Tron.</font>

1620
01:09:32,389 --> 01:09:34,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then it got a virus that
made the motorbikes go slow...</font>

1621
01:09:34,958 --> 01:09:36,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then Vanellope stopped
wanting to hang out in there.</font>

1622
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, is there a way</font>

1623
01:09:38,628 --> 01:09:40,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to do something
like that to Slaughter Race?</font>

1624
01:09:40,797 --> 01:09:41,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, there's ways.</font>

1625
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

1626
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:50,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got mothers' maiden names...</font>

1627
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">social security numbers,
PIN numbers...</font>

1628
01:09:52,976 --> 01:09:54,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this area down here</font>

1629
01:09:54,411 --> 01:09:55,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is what's called the Darknet.</font>

1630
01:09:55,979 --> 01:09:57,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot of shady characters
hang out down here...</font>

1631
01:09:57,848 --> 01:10:00,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so try to keep a low profile.
Gord!</font>

1632
01:10:00,016 --> 01:10:01,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, there you are.</font>

1633
01:10:01,818 --> 01:10:04,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now Gord here, he's
dabbled in virus-making.</font>

1634
01:10:04,354 --> 01:10:06,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But his cousin, this guy
we're gonna go see...</font>

1635
01:10:06,356 --> 01:10:09,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Double Dan, this dude
is a virus-making machine.</font>

1636
01:10:10,494 --> 01:10:11,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, oh, here we go.</font>

1637
01:10:11,528 --> 01:10:13,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure this is safe?</font>

1638
01:10:13,563 --> 01:10:15,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it safe?
Of course it is.</font>

1639
01:10:15,398 --> 01:10:18,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just whatever you do, do not
look at his little brother.</font>

1640
01:10:18,368 --> 01:10:19,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, he has a little brother?</font>

1641
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Double Dan!</font>

1642
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:26,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Long time no see.</font>

1643
01:10:26,877 --> 01:10:28,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

1644
01:10:28,378 --> 01:10:29,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">JP Spamley.</font>

1645
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:31,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, we met one time
over at Friendster...</font>

1646
01:10:31,782 --> 01:10:35,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which tells you
it had to be a long time ago.</font>

1647
01:10:35,418 --> 01:10:36,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oye. What are you looking at?
- Nothing.</font>

1648
01:10:36,888 --> 01:10:37,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you looking at my brother?</font>

1649
01:10:37,989 --> 01:10:39,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, sir.
- Don't you look</font>

1650
01:10:39,056 --> 01:10:40,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at my little brother.</font>

1651
01:10:40,024 --> 01:10:42,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, no, I wasn't.
- He's very self-conscious!</font>

1652
01:10:45,395 --> 01:10:46,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You?</font>

1653
01:10:46,663 --> 01:10:48,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

1654
01:10:48,532 --> 01:10:49,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

1655
01:10:49,766 --> 01:10:52,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The reason I came to
your neck of the face...</font>

1656
01:10:52,003 --> 01:10:54,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, there's a face
in your neck. I mean, woods.</font>

1657
01:10:54,805 --> 01:10:57,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neck of the woods. The reason
I'm here is 'cause I...</font>

1658
01:10:57,141 --> 01:10:59,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I heard
a little tumor, rumor...</font>

1659
01:10:59,609 --> 01:11:01,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard a rumor
that you could, well,</font>

1660
01:11:01,045 --> 01:11:03,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">give me a harmless virus
kind of thing...</font>

1661
01:11:03,446 --> 01:11:04,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that might be able to</font>

1662
01:11:04,414 --> 01:11:06,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">slow down
the Slaughter Race game?</font>

1663
01:11:06,416 --> 01:11:08,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>

1664
01:11:08,152 --> 01:11:10,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My cousin Gordon told me
that you wanted to crash it.</font>

1665
01:11:10,988 --> 01:11:12,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crash it? No!</font>

1666
01:11:12,089 --> 01:11:13,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.</font>

1667
01:11:13,958 --> 01:11:15,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want
anyone getting hurt.</font>

1668
01:11:15,559 --> 01:11:16,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

1669
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:18,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If there's a way
to just, uh...</font>

1670
01:11:18,763 --> 01:11:19,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know...</font>

1671
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:22,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just make the cars
go slow or something...</font>

1672
01:11:22,066 --> 01:11:24,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so the game is boring...</font>

1673
01:11:24,668 --> 01:11:26,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and my friend
comes back home to me.</font>

1674
01:11:26,804 --> 01:11:30,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow me to
introduce you to Arthur.</font>

1675
01:11:32,076 --> 01:11:34,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy there, boy.</font>

1676
01:11:34,111 --> 01:11:35,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's keen.</font>

1677
01:11:35,947 --> 01:11:39,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arthur's what I call
an insecurity virus.</font>

1678
01:11:39,784 --> 01:11:42,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Means he looks for
little flaws and weaknesses</font>

1679
01:11:42,619 --> 01:11:44,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that make a program insecure.</font>

1680
01:11:47,058 --> 01:11:49,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You release him into that
Slaughter Race game,</font>

1681
01:11:49,827 --> 01:11:52,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arthur will find some defect
in the code.</font>

1682
01:11:52,562 --> 01:11:54,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then he'll copy that defect</font>

1683
01:11:54,131 --> 01:11:56,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and spread it
all over the game...</font>

1684
01:11:56,868 --> 01:12:00,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until everything becomes,
quote, unquote, "boring"...</font>

1685
01:12:00,503 --> 01:12:02,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just like you wanted.</font>

1686
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:04,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1687
01:12:04,108 --> 01:12:06,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just to be super clear here...</font>

1688
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:07,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no one gets hurt, right?</font>

1689
01:12:07,477 --> 01:12:08,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you stupid?</font>

1690
01:12:08,613 --> 01:12:09,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, uh...</font>

1691
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because the only way
anyone gets hurt...</font>

1692
01:12:11,983 --> 01:12:13,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is if you are stupid.</font>

1693
01:12:13,483 --> 01:12:14,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All you have to do...</font>

1694
01:12:14,986 --> 01:12:18,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is make sure the virus stays
in Slaughter Race.</font>

1695
01:12:18,522 --> 01:12:20,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Don't be stupid.</font>

1696
01:12:20,524 --> 01:12:21,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure it doesn't get out
of Slaughter Race.</font>

1697
01:12:21,859 --> 01:12:22,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goiter it. Gah!</font>

1698
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Got it! Got it.
- Get out!</font>

1699
01:12:24,128 --> 01:12:25,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you,
you're a cyst face.</font>

1700
01:12:25,663 --> 01:12:26,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Out!
- I mean, assistance.</font>

1701
01:12:26,831 --> 01:12:28,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for your
cyst face... Assistance.</font>

1702
01:12:28,699 --> 01:12:30,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get out!
- Goodbye!</font>

1703
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:31,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh.</font>

1704
01:12:34,872 --> 01:12:36,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah! Fiddlesticks!
Well, that's game.</font>

1705
01:12:36,707 --> 01:12:38,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, beginner's luck.</font>

1706
01:12:38,042 --> 01:12:39,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, kid.
I know a hustle</font>

1707
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:40,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I see one.</font>

1708
01:12:41,946 --> 01:12:43,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Player's on the way.
- Thanks, Bob.</font>

1709
01:12:43,915 --> 01:12:45,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's roll!
- Game faces on, guys.</font>

1710
01:12:45,516 --> 01:12:47,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show time. You ready
for your first race?</font>

1711
01:12:47,618 --> 01:12:50,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, yeah. I think so.</font>

1712
01:12:50,021 --> 01:12:52,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, don't be nervous.
You're gonna be great.</font>

1713
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:54,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, no, I know.
I'll be fine.</font>

1714
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:56,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. You didn't tell
Ralph yet, did you?</font>

1715
01:12:58,062 --> 01:12:59,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not exactly.</font>

1716
01:12:59,897 --> 01:13:02,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, V.
He's your best friend.</font>

1717
01:13:02,533 --> 01:13:03,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta let him know</font>

1718
01:13:03,834 --> 01:13:05,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're planning on
staying here for a while.</font>

1719
01:13:05,569 --> 01:13:08,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. But he's gonna
get really upset.</font>

1720
01:13:08,572 --> 01:13:10,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he might,
but you guys...</font>

1721

- Hmm.</font>

1863
01:21:17,464 --> 01:21:18,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, delightful!</font>

1864
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:20,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're that courteous
little cherub</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">who says "please"

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can KnowsMore
help you find today?</font>

1867
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:24,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a whole...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whole Foods,
a hole in the ozone...</font>

01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:33,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friend...</font>

1872
01:21:33,747 --> 01:21:35,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This would probably be
an appropriate time</font>

1873
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:36,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for me to shutter my site.</font>

1874
01:21:44,724 --> 01:21:46,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long you think</font>

1875
01:21:46,091 --> 01:21:47,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before they get in here?</font>

1876
01:21:47,461 --> 01:21:49,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Precisely one second.</font>

1877
01:21:51,598 --> 01:21:53,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow!</font>

1878
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, hey!</font>

01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:55,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me!
It's the real me!</font>

1880
01:21:55,669 --> 01:21:58,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow!</font>

1881
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:00,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ralph?
- My apologies.</font>

1882
01:22:00,574 --> 01:22:01,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I followed those things here.</font>

1883
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:03,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think they're looking
for you, kid.</font>

1884
01:22:04,144 --> 01:22:07,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you think?
What did you do?</font>

1885
01:22:07,247 --> 01:22:10,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.
I don't how this happened.</font>

1886
01:22:10,383 --> 01:22:11,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I think
it's fairly obvious.</font>

1887
01:22:11,485 --> 01:22:14,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It happened because
an insecurity virus cloned...</font>

1888
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all of your needy, clingy,
self-destructive behavior.</font>

1889
01:22:16,623 --> 01:22:18,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The very behavior
which left unchecked</font>

1890
01:22:18,325 --> 01:22:19,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can destroy friendships...</font>

1891
01:22:19,693 --> 01:22:23,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and in this particular case,
the entire Internet!</font>

1892
01:22:25,265 --> 01:22:27,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">KnowsMore!
You have all the answers.</font>

1893
01:22:27,133 --> 01:22:28,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Official query...</font>

1894
01:22:28,435 --> 01:22:30,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what do I do if clones of me</font>

1895
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:33,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are trying to capture
my friend? Search.</font>

1896
01:22:34,374 --> 01:22:36,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I find two results
for your query.</font>

1897
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:38,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Either you put all the clones
in therapy.</font>

1898
01:22:38,712 --> 01:22:40,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not very realistic.</font>

1899
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or, the anti-virus district
is surrounded</font>

1900
01:22:42,649 --> 01:22:44,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by a gate made from
security software.</font>

1901
01:22:44,718 --> 01:22:45,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Vanellope could somehow</font>

1902
01:22:45,685 --> 01:22:47,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lead all of the clones
through the gate...</font>

1903
01:22:47,187 --> 01:22:49,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they would be deleted
all at once.</font>

1904
01:22:49,189 --> 01:22:52,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sort of a co-dependent
pied piper situation.</font>

1905
01:22:52,392 --> 01:22:55,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. We know a pied piper.</font>

1906
01:22:55,128 --> 01:22:56,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We do?
- Yesss.</font>

1907
01:22:56,563 --> 01:22:58,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who?
- Yesss!</font>

1908
01:22:58,131 --> 01:22:58,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but who is it?</font>

1909
01:23:01,201 --> 01:23:02,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you mean Yesss!</font>

1910
01:23:06,573 --> 01:23:09,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for your help,
KnowsMore.</font>

1911
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:11,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a bit of an empty gesture
at this point,</font>

1912
01:23:11,177 --> 01:23:13,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wouldn't you say?</font>

1913
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess I forgot
to tell Ralph</font>

1914
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:16,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that when you
break the Internet...</font>

1915
01:23:16,516 --> 01:23:19,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you don't literally
have to break the Internet.</font>

1916
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:20,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe he did this.</font>

1917
01:23:20,554 --> 01:23:23,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, I mean,
dude obviously made</font>

1918
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:25,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">some real questionable
choices here.</font>

1919
01:23:25,325 --> 01:23:29,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he also made a bee pun to
save his best friend's game...</font>

1920
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:33,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so what can I say, kid,
life's complicated.</font>

1921
01:23:34,334 --> 01:23:36,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ready to pied the piper?</font>

1922
01:23:39,339 --> 01:23:41,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yoo-hoo! Up here!</font>

1923
01:23:42,777 --> 01:23:45,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me, your bestest friend
in the whole wide world...</font>

1924
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who you can't live without!</font>

1925
01:23:48,248 --> 01:23:49,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friend!</font>

1926
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:55,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, from up here I can see
how I do come across as...</font>

1927
01:23:55,622 --> 01:23:57,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">needy, and clingy,</font>

1928
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:59,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and self-destructive
like KnowsMore said.</font>

1929
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, kid...</font>

1930
01:24:02,462 --> 01:24:03,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't blame you</font>

1931
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for not wanting
to be my friend anymore.</font>

1932
01:24:05,599 --> 01:24:07,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never said I didn't
want to be your friend.</font>

1933
01:24:07,768 --> 01:24:11,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said you were acting like
a bad friend. Which you were.</font>

1934
01:24:11,471 --> 01:24:13,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I was, but I...</font>

1935
01:24:13,206 --> 01:24:14,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, my babies!</font>

1936
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:17,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the anti-virus district
straight ahead. Whoo!</font>

1937
01:24:17,477 --> 01:24:19,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, to be
continued, okay?</font>

1938
01:24:26,821 --> 01:24:28,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo-hoo!
We're gonna make it!</font>

1939
01:24:44,839 --> 01:24:46,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys okay?</font>

1940
01:24:46,272 --> 01:24:47,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine!</font>

1941
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:50,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, all good.
Look, we can still do this.</font>

1942
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:52,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, big man.
Help me turn this thing over.</font>

1943
01:24:53,948 --> 01:24:56,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

1944
01:24:56,282 --> 01:24:58,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, guys?</font>

1945
01:25:08,863 --> 01:25:12,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friend?</font>

1946
01:25:12,298 --> 01:25:14,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is unsettling.</font>

1947
01:25:18,406 --> 01:25:19,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friend.</font>

1948
01:25:20,408 --> 01:25:21,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get Vanellope out of here now.</font>

1949
01:25:21,976 --> 01:25:23,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about you, Ralph?</font>

1950
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:25,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just go. I got a date with
the man in the mirror.</font>

1951
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:27,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you!</font>

1952
01:25:30,484 --> 01:25:32,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You keep away from her!</font>

1953
01:25:32,953 --> 01:25:35,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna wreck it!</font>

1954
01:25:37,825 --> 01:25:40,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not your friend!</font>

1955
01:25:41,429 --> 01:25:43,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's my friend!</font>

1956
01:25:44,331 --> 01:25:45,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here it is, this way.</font>

1957
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:47,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, kid.
We gotta move.</font>

1958
01:26:00,347 --> 01:26:01,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eeeee-oh-boy!</font>

1959
01:26:18,766 --> 01:26:19,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1960
01:26:20,868 --> 01:26:22,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

1961
01:26:22,536 --> 01:26:25,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vanellope!</font>

1962
01:26:30,377 --> 01:26:32,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Let go of me!</font>

1963
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:36,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Kid!
- Ralph!</font>

1964
01:26:41,622 --> 01:26:43,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1965
01:26:43,357 --> 01:26:45,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, get back here!</font>

1966
01:26:45,793 --> 01:26:46,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1967
01:26:48,562 --> 01:26:49,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You put her down!</font>

1968
01:26:49,997 --> 01:26:51,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

1969
01:27:13,922 --> 01:27:15,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vanellope!</font>

1970
01:27:31,739 --> 01:27:35,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, you're acting
like a real bad guy here!</font>

1971
01:27:35,676 --> 01:27:38,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1972
01:27:38,079 --> 01:27:39,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you are!</font>

1973
01:27:39,613 --> 01:27:41,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I will never
be your friend!</font>

1974
01:27:45,753 --> 01:27:47,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, doofus!</font>

1975
01:27:47,956 --> 01:27:48,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralph!</font>

1976
01:27:56,697 --> 01:27:58,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Catch me if you can,
you big dummy!</font>

1977
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:07,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you, little sister.</font>

1978
01:28:10,745 --> 01:28:12,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now go!
Get out of here!</font>

1979
01:28:12,413 --> 01:28:14,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ralph!
- Go!</font>

1980
01:28:14,082 --> 01:28:16,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!
Don't hurt him!</font>

1981
01:28:17,551 --> 01:28:18,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, no!</font>

1982
01:28:23,424 --> 01:28:25,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it!
You're squishing him!</font>

1983
01:28:27,629 --> 01:28:29,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna
kill my best friend!</font>

1984
01:28:33,835 --> 01:28:36,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine! You win!
You win, okay?</font>

1985
01:28:39,608 --> 01:28:41,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just please put him down.</font>

1986
01:28:44,546 --> 01:28:47,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be your
only friend, okay?</font>

1987
01:28:47,082 --> 01:28:49,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just let him go.</font>

1988
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:50,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No, kid.</font>

1989
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:52,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1990
01:28:54,556 --> 01:28:56,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.
That's it. Yeah.</font>

1991
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:59,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put him down
and I'll go with you...</font>

1992
01:28:59,661 --> 01:29:01,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we'll be
best friends forever.</font>

1993
01:29:02,530 --> 01:29:04,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just me and you.</font>

1994
01:29:04,666 --> 01:29:05,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what you want, right?</font>

1995
01:29:09,137 --> 01:29:10,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well,
that's not what I want!</font>

1996
01:29:12,207 --> 01:29:14,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not right to hold
a friend back from her dreams!</font>

1997
01:29:14,776 --> 01:29:16,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't own her!</font>

1998
01:29:16,912 --> 01:29:19,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not how
friendship works!</font>

1999
01:29:19,714 --> 01:29:21,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to let her go!</font>

2000
01:29:23,685 --> 01:29:24,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

2001
01:29:28,723 --> 01:29:29,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to let her go.</font>

2002
01:29:32,861 --> 01:29:35,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. It's gonna hurt
a little bit when you do.</font>

2003
01:29:37,899 --> 01:29:39,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, who am I kidding?
It's gonna hurt a lot.</font>

2004
01:29:41,703 --> 01:29:43,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're gonna be okay.</font>

2005
01:29:46,574 --> 01:29:48,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we're gonna be okay.</font>

2006
01:29:48,276 --> 01:29:49,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, kid?</font>

2007
01:29:51,179 --> 01:29:53,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course we are. Always.</font>

2008
01:29:55,984 --> 01:29:59,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? No matter
where she goes...</font>

2009
01:29:59,054 --> 01:30:01,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or where she lives...</font>

2010
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:04,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she's always gonna
be our friend.</font>

2011
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:06,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we just gotta trust her.</font>

2012
01:30:06,628 --> 01:30:09,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because that's what
best friends do.</font>

2013
01:30:10,165 --> 01:30:11,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>

2014
01:30:26,248 --> 01:30:27,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, buddy.</font>

2015
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:30,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!</font>

2016
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:34,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel good about this.</font>

2017
01:30:34,589 --> 01:30:36,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

2018
01:30:36,591 --> 01:30:38,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

2019
01:30:40,962 --> 01:30:42,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralph, look!</font>

2020
01:30:42,131 --> 01:30:44,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you fixed
your insecurity!</font>

2021
01:30:46,068 --> 01:30:47,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.</font>

2022
01:30:47,303 --> 01:30:49,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo-hoo!</font>

2023
01:30:49,637 --> 01:30:50,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralph, no!</font>

2024
01:30:52,807 --> 01:30:54,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

2025
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:56,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Park it right here, Ralph!</font>

2026
01:30:56,312 --> 01:30:58,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your ol' pal
JP Spamley's gotcha!</font>

2027
01:30:58,646 --> 01:31:00,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

2028
01:31:02,151 --> 01:31:03,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, that didn't work.</font>

2029
01:31:07,856 --> 01:31:09,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look up there!</font>

2030
01:31:09,758 --> 01:31:11,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a big strong man
in need of rescuing.</font>

2031
01:31:20,269 --> 01:31:21,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hah!</font>

2032
01:32:10,119 --> 01:32:12,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

2033
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:16,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thanks, Frogger.</font>

2034
01:32:16,658 --> 01:32:17,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.</font>

2035
01:32:18,327 --> 01:32:19,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are all of you?</font>

2036
01:32:19,962 --> 01:32:21,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're friends of Vanellope's.</font>

2037
01:32:21,997 --> 01:32:24,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, and any friend
of Vanellope's</font>

2038
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:25,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a friend of ours.</font>

2039
01:32:25,801 --> 01:32:27,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>

2040
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:29,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralph!</font>

2041
01:32:29,038 --> 01:32:31,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looking good, big fella!</font>

2042
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:32,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heyo!</font>

2043
01:32:33,876 --> 01:32:35,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This dress is not made
for a big boy.</font>

2044
01:32:35,077 --> 01:32:37,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's going right up
the back alley there.</font>

2045
01:32:37,079 --> 01:32:38,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me just make
a little adjustment.</font>

2046
01:32:38,747 --> 01:32:41,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There we go.</font>

2047
01:32:41,183 --> 01:32:42,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Internet users are breathing</i></font>

2048
01:32:42,785 --> 01:32:45,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>a collective sigh
of relief tonight.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Just as mysteriously

has vanished.</i></font>

2051
01:32:56,098 --> 01:32:58,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what
I just realized?</font>

2052
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sun never rises
or sets here...</font>

2053
01:33:00,936 --> 01:33:02,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because everything's
always on.</font>

2054
01:33:02,905 --> 01:33:05,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, now, isn't that
an astute observation?</font>

2055
01:33:05,474 --> 01:33:07,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, right?</font>

2056
01:33:07,042 --> 01:33:08,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
other than KnowsMore,</font>

2057
01:33:08,244 --> 01:33:10,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm probably the smartest guy
on the Internet.</font>

2058
01:33:10,012 --> 01:33:12,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

2059
01:33:12,047 --> 01:33:15,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, V. We're about to come
back online. You ready?</font>

2060
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:16,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be right there!</font>

2061
01:33:16,452 --> 01:33:19,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Ralph,
don't be a stranger!</font>

2062
01:33:19,121 --> 01:33:21,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I can't be much stranger
than you, Shank.</font>

2063
01:33:21,724 --> 01:33:24,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. That's a good dad joke.</font>

2064
01:33:25,428 --> 01:33:27,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, don't forget.</font>

2065
01:33:27,129 --> 01:33:29,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know Shank added
my code and everything,</font>

2066
01:33:29,064 --> 01:33:30,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I'll be able
to regenerate.</font>

2067
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna be totally safe.</font>

2068
01:33:32,034 --> 01:33:34,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I know.
It's gonna be great.</font>

2069
01:33:34,471 --> 01:33:36,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You found your dream game.</font>

2070
01:33:36,071 --> 01:33:37,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I did.</font>

2071
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:39,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did.</font>

2072
01:33:40,109 --> 01:33:42,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, uh...</font>

2073
01:33:42,244 --> 01:33:45,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I should probably
head in there now, you know?</font>

2074
01:33:45,281 --> 01:33:48,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, before you go,
I wanted to give you this.</font>

2075
01:33:49,318 --> 01:33:52,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm so sorry
I broke it, Ralph.</font>

2076
01:33:52,154 --> 01:33:54,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. It's okay.</font>

2077
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:56,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we can both
have a half. See?</font>

2078
01:33:58,295 --> 01:33:59,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

2079
01:34:06,869 --> 01:34:08,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you so much.</font>

2080
01:34:09,939 --> 01:34:11,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm really gonna miss you.</font>

2081

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna miss you too, kid.</font>

2082
01:34:16,313 --> 01:34:17,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really am.</font>

2083
01:34:23,453 --> 01:34:24,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

2084
01:34:26,356 --> 01:34:28,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, getting a little clingy
on me, here.</font>

2085
01:34:31,194 --> 01:34:33,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on. Get out of here.</font>

2086
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:34,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world's
waiting for you, kid.</font>

2095
01:35:48,038 --> 01:35:50,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, golly. I'm sorry
you didn't win, Taffyta.</font>

2096
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:53,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pfft! Our friendship
is much more important to me</font>

2097

to you two,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">how on earth did you
tame those things?</font>

2105
01:36:07,023 --> 01:36:08,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's simple, Surge.</font>

2106
01:36:08,391 --> 01:36:10,992

<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that is the secret
to raising perfect children.</font>

2109
01:36:21,638 --> 01:36:25,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, I wish every parent

And how about you, Ralph?</font>
