1
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,347
Four billion years ago,
the first marine life forms.

2
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:42,019
First came the fish...then slowly
other life forms evolved.

3
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,979
Therefore, our ancestors...

4
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,898
...came from fish.

5
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:47,608
Everyone, come and see this.

6
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,361
Cretaceous Tyrannosaurus.

7
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,488
Ferocious!

8
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:58,869
Red,

9
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,079
Pong!

10
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,999
Isn't this a gecko?

11
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,419
How else can I get a 15 ton T-Rex in here?

12
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:11,048
With our advanced technology, I shrank it down.

13
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,842
There's also the Panthera tigris.

14
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,930
That's a dog!

15
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:22,643
Lucky is a genuine Panthera tigris balica.

16
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,186
You call it Lucky?

17
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,355
Lucky's a dog's name!

18
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,231
What...Lucky?

19
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,274
When did I say Lucky?

20
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,402
"Lucky"

21
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,486
Hurry, your turn!

22
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,238
So what if it's called Lucky...

23
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,075
...it's still Panthera tigris balica!

24
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,912
Hey man...you're expecting
a lot for only ten bucks.

25
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:49,420
Nature is truly wonderful.

26
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,006
To adapt to different environments...

27
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:55,801
...creatures from land, sea and sky crossbreed
and humans are no exception.

28
00:02:56,594 --> 00:03:00,931
Take for example...the scientific name of a man
that can fly is called "Batman".

29
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:05,561
In Chinese, it's Batman.
In English, it's still Batman.

30
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,606
Miss, why are you eating Batman's ear?

31
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,526
I thought they're chicken wings.

32
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,071
Even if you don't respect Batman,
you should respect yourself!

33
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:17,823
Put the chicken wing back!

34
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,284
Not chicken wing...l mean Batman's ear.

35
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,542
Anything else to see?

36
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,628
Yes, of course, silly.

37
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:32,963
How did you guess that?

38
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,674
I've got a mermaid back here.

39
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:39,595
Wow, you're really switched on!

40
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,974
Isn't this salted fish?

41
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,435
Such a fool!

42
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,437
Of course, specimens are
always preserved with salt!

43
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,481
The exhibition's over. Goodbye!

44
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,441
I don't believe you! You're lying!

45
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:53,609
Refund!

46
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:54,693
Right, refund!

47
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:57,655
Refund! Refund! Refund!

48
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,913
Enough! I've worked damn
hard to run this place!

49
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:09,333
You idiots want to ruin me. It ain't happening!

50
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,335
Open the door! Let them see it!

51
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,045
Are you sure?

52
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,338
Open it!

53
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,419
I am a mermaid...

54
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,718
My heart...Help!

55
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:08,434
Okay, is that really necessary?

56
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:15,065
Hey...I'm just trying to make a living, okay?

57
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,443
Don't worry...be happy!

58
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,320
Let's take a picture.

59
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,655
Damn you

60
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,999
1O billion

61
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,793
10.05 billion

62
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,841
2O billion

63
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,760
20 billion once...

64
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,095
2O billion twice...

65
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:46,680
20.01 billion

66
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,182
20.02 billion

67
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:49,975
20.03 billion

68
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:50,934
20.04 billion

69
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,853
20.05 billion, 20.06 billion

70
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,605
Please...be calm.

71
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,440
20.07 billion

72
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,192
20.08 billion

73
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,486
20.08 billion once...

74
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:03,155
20.08 billion twice...Come on...

75
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,116
20.08 billion. Deal!

76
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,660
Mr. Liu, why would you pay 300% for this land?

77
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,496
About this land in Green Gulf...

78
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,415
...our group wants to develop it into
the most environmental and ecological project.

79
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,751
So it cannot be measured by
money, right? Thank you!

80
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,491
Uncle Rich

81
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,452
- Liu...
- Ruo4an“.

82
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,662
Cheng, you're on time today!

83
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,915
I heard you bought Green Gulf and opened
a bottle of '90 Romanée Conti.

84
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,084
I have to be on time for once!

85
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,296
I'm...I'm really sorry.

86
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,339
When it's this good, I have to act fast!

87
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,176
Look at this land in Green Gulf.

88
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,343
Spectacular...so beautiful!

89
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,555
Let's celebrate!

90
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,976
Are you sure about Green Gulf?

91
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,979
You really don't know anything
about real estate!

92
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,856
Have you worked out the numbers?

93
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:01,899
No...

94
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,318
...but Uncle Rich and Ruo-lan did.

95
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,821
No matter how much they bid,
I just outbid them...

96
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,324
...and always just by one more.

97
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,744
The cost of one bid is nothing! Not even enough
to build my own toilet!

98
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,872
What did the legendary Bruce Lee teach us?

99
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,374
Be like water, my friend!

100
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,168
Just go with the flow.

101
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,507
"Being invincible is lonely,"

102
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,802
"so lonely."

103
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,306
"Being invincible is empty,"

104
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,518
"so empty."

105
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,103
Stop that awful song!

106
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,399
If Rue-Ian had got Green Gulf,
it would have been a failure.

107
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,319
She would have just raised
the land prices in the area...

108
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,322
...and boost the sales of their own properties.

109
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,866
You're an idiot!

110
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,201
You just bought a piece of crap!

111
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,953
There's nothing there!

112
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,248
You've got some nerve...talking about Bruce Lee!

113
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,958
What were you thinking, you idiot!

114
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,294
Mr. Liu is offering us his Romanée Conti.

115
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,338
Be nice or he'll change his mind.

116
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,214
Ruo4an“.

117
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,758
You're adding insult to injury!

118
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:14,930
Liu's project...l estimate he would
lose about 20 billion...

119
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,432
...but it would also raise our market value.

120
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,811
Without even trying,
we'll be earning 3O billion...

121
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,648
...and now we're drinking
his million dollar wine.

122
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,317
Aren't we greedy savages?

123
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,406
You're igniting yourself to illuminate us!

124
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,491
You...

125
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,285
...are a great man!

126
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:38,996
You're my idol!

127
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,666
You're far too generous!
I could never repay you in my lifetime,

128
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,335
or even in the next one.

129
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,216
Brutal!

130
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,636
If Green Gulf could be reclaimed,
the profits would be huge!

131
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,765
Reclamation?

132
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:03,186
Green Gulf is a conservation area
with plenty of dolphins there.

133
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,898
Otherwise, why would I sell you that
piece of crap land right next to it?

134
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,484
You really think I would do this for you?

135
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,194
I heard that the dolphins are moving away.

136
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,863
What are you talking about?

137
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,158
What's this?

138
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,367
Reclamation permit.

139
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,244
Is this for real?

140
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,163
Of course!

141
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,589
That's it...I'm leaving!

142
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,632
Cheng...

143
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,261
I thought we're okay.
What are doing with the pesticides?

144
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,598
Pesticides? You idiot!

145
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,311
This is our newly acquired high-tech Jetpack.

146
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,313
Take it off...you haven't even had a drink yet!

147
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,314
I'm not taking it off!

148
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,232
Why don't you make me?

149
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:52,903
You son of a bitch!

150
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,155
God damn you!

151
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:12,381
Wow...the granite wall!

152
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,757
I feel so bad for...

153
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:14,591
The granite...

154
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,760
Cheng can be such a jackass.

155
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,261
Can't people just talk reasonably?

156
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,097
Why throw a tantrum?

157
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,974
You're smart...you're a great man!

158
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,770
Open the door and let him fly out!

159
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,815
Green Gulf is a profitable project.

160
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:30,941
How about doing it together?

161
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,276
It's my honor, Uncle Rich!

162
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,154
That's great! Now that I'm retired...

163
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,489
...you can work together with Ruo-Lan.

164
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,699
Deal?

165
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,203
We have a big party today...let's have fun!

166
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,201
Whoever gets this watch...it's yours.

167
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,498
You're so weird.

168
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,585
Who are you? Are you trying to humiliate us?

169
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,546
How much can her watch be worth?

170
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,591
Not much...just 8 million!

171
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:47,392
Miss Ruo-lan, you just threw
8 million into the water?

172
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:51,271
Spending 8 million to open
your eyes is well worth it.

173
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,940
Now you can see their true colors.

174
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:54,983
Very clearly!

175
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:00,280
They're young people...
working hard for their money.

176
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,449
I highly respect that!

177
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:03,658
Aren't we all the same?

178
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:11,625
You came from nothing. It takes great ability
to achieve what you have now.

179
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,544
You even manage to get the reclamation permit.

180
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,672
Those second generation rich
brats can't even compare.

181
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,674
Cut the crap...let's work together.

182
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,259
How do you wanna do it?

183
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,345
You've got such a promising project...

184
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,681
...and I've got the biggest brand name realty.
What do you think we should do?

185
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,227
Join forces...raise the stock price...

186
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,395
...and make a killing on the stock market.

187
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,147
Of course!

188
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,275
3O billion should buy me 50%.

189
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,276
40%.

190
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,153
Aren't you worried I'd be upset?

191
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,321
No.

192
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:50,997
Happy now?

193
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,792
At least 45%.

194
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,210
Deal.

195
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,006
Mr. Liu...

196
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,346
Mr. Liu, I...

197
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,856
What the hell are you guys doing?
How did she get in here?

198
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,024
Stop! What are you doing?

199
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,861
Don't go over there!
People like that have diseases!

200
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,404
It's fine. I'll just take a look, okay?

201
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,905
Then go ahead. I'm leaving!

202
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,414
Boss, this person is not on
our list of dancers.

203
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:34,791
Who are you?

204
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,210
Mr. Liu, my name is Shan.

205
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,921
Sorry, I sneaked in.

206
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,548
You're so handsome!

207
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,716
Of course! Take her away.

208
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,885
- Let's go...
- Wait!

209
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,930
This is my number. Please call me okay?

210
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,181
I'm begging you.

211
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:52,976
Okay-

212
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,312
You will call me. Right?

213
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,939
You promised! You call me anytime.

214
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:02,068
Thank you! I'm so grateful!

215
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,904
You're so handsome!

216
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,036
It's pathetic!

217
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,930
Smells good!

218
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,723
Come, try it.

219
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,146
Thank you.

220
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,189
A bucket of fish food,

221
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,274
a bottle of anti-inflammatory solution.

222
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,443
Okay, thank you!

223
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,049
Shan...

224
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,259
How is our plan going?

225
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,429
I gave my number to Liu Xuan.

226
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,056
He promised to call me.

227
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:36,973
That's great!

228
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,602
That bastard Liu Xuan destroyed Green Gulf!

229
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,229
He destroyed our home and killed so many of us!

230
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,900
Finally...we can take revenge!

231
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:57,368
Together with Haichang Holdings, we have opened
an aquarium in Dalian Tiger Beach.

232
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:01,122
The polar theme park in Shanghai Dishui Lake...

233
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,291
...will also be completed in 2017.

234
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,418
Its scale is comparable with Disney.

235
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,756
The PR department is currently promoting
the conservation of marine animals.

236
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:10,423
Alright...

237
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,134
Haichang is the leading
pioneer in this industry.

238
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,844
Let's leave it to them to protect the Earth.

239
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:18,723
I'm shallow...I'm only interested in money.

240
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,059
Let's talk about the Green Gulf project.

241
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,187
We've placed sonar transmitters in Green Gulf.

242
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,648
It's been producing effective results.

243
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:31,111
No dolphins have been found within a radius
of 5O nautical miles from Green Gulf.

244
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,571
So, no problems with the reclamation work.

245
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,574
What guarantees are there
that the dolphins won't be back?

246
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,204
The sonars, this time are different
from the earlier ones.

247
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:44,040
They're more powerful and destructive.

248
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,418
We can also adjust the frequencies
to target different species.

249
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,840
This is a simulation of what the dolphins
will experience from the sonars.

250
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,300
Here's a cute goldfish.

251
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:55,927
Switch on.

252
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,311
Oh my God!

253
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,147
- That's too cruel!
- Game over!

254
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,815
I'm dizzy.

255
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,192
Take a photo for me. That's so scary!

256
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,993
The dolphins won't be back for sure.

257
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,995
Anyone dare to try it?

258
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:26,749
In fact, the sonar can also
help us to explore the ocean.

259
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,377
The research shows that...

260
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,339
...one of the frequencies is not from dolphins.

261
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:45,620
In ancient times, both humans
and our ancestors were apes.

262
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,748
With the land changing...

263
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:53,336
...some apes were forced to live in the sea.

264
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,845
Their legs were of no use...

265
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:06,349
...and evolved into fishtails.

266
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,853
Mermaids and humans should have
coexisted side by side.

267
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,359
But ever since ancient times...

268
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:23,491
...whenever humans spotted us,
they hunted us down.

269
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:31,124
Since then, we stayed away from humans.

270
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:35,962
However, the more advanced they've gotten,
the more violent they've become.

271
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,574
So humans are evil.

272
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,661
But...

273
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,794
But what?

274
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,508
Shitai fell asleep again...

275
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,679
...but she's right. All humans are evil!

276
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,682
Chemical wastes...bombs...everything.

277
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:31,851
It's already very hard for us to avoid these...

278
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:36,439
...but now with the sonars all over the ocean,
there's no way to escape!

279
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,941
Now we're stuck in Green Gulf.

280
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,362
There's no way out, not by land or sea!

281
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,282
We have to kill Liu Xuan...he's responsible!

282
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,867
Thats's our only hope to return to the ocean.

283
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,870
Everyone knows Liu Xuan is a pervert.

284
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,664
Look at the news...you'll know.

285
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,710
So we sent our beauty,
Shan with a modified tail.

286
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,088
She's gone through intense training...

287
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,256
...always sneaking into the human world
and getting our daily supplies.

288
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,966
She's very experienced.

289
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,677
See how devoted she is to her dancing!

290
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,471
She's fearless.

291
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,515
I think she dances better than MacDonald.

292
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,183
It's Madonna, okay?

293
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,935
I say Madonna...so what?

294
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,528
Here's our plan...a honey trap.

295
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:26,197
First, we send our beauty...

296
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,408
...to seduce the target.

297
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:32,245
Then we send our assassins to kill him.

298
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,707
Simple as that!

299
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,918
There's foam coming out of your mouth!

300
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,963
Because of this poisonous arrow.

301
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:48,511
Alcohol can remove this poison,
but not my hatred.

302
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:51,222
Kill Liu Xuan!

303
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,516
But the one I hate the most is not Liu Xuan.

304
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,977
It's you bitch!

305
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,437
Why did you shoot me?

306
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,439
Liu Xuan is the target, not me!

307
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,816
It was an accident.

308
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,652
What? That definitely was no accident!

309
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,863
Hey, I had to test it, right?

310
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:09,699
To make sure it worked.

311
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:10,575
Right?

312
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:13,411
You're fired! Dismiss!

313
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:16,706
<i>Sham, come here.</i>

314
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,750
You always bring back roast chicken.

315
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,003
You're the only one who likes it.
What about the others?

316
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:23,171
I'm sorry.

317
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,672
Liu Xuan is a typical pervert.

318
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,633
He may kiss you when you seduce him.

319
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,759
Do you have any experience?

320
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:29,469
No.

321
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,637
I think it's my duty to practice with you.

322
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:32,597
Okay-

323
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,197
Did you feel anything?

324
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:50,031
No.

325
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,032
Impossible!

326
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,283
Nothing at all.

327
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,160
You must have felt something. Don't be shy.

328
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,703
Don't hold back your feelings.

329
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,122
Release your emotions and feel it. Okay?

330
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,124
There's nothing, you fool!

331
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,169
That's a relief.

332
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,545
What's next?

333
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:06,964
Wait for the call!

334
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,635
The frequency is very strange...

335
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,471
...possibly from an unknown species on Earth.

336
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,014
Are there aliens?

337
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,600
What aliens? ET?

338
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,435
Just give me the report in 3 days.

339
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,229
Why do you always suppress me?

340
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,356
Not suppress, just pressing.

341
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:34,158
Mr Chairman has something
urgent to take care of.

342
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,743
Please leave immediately!

343
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,037
You're bad!

344
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,207
Don't...

345
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,756
Still no call yet. ls there something
wrong with our plan?

346
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,176
The honey trap depends on the honey.

347
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,220
Shan is pretty...shouldn't be any problems.

348
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,390
No, no...I'm just an ordinary girl.

349
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,393
Not ordinary at all!
Her eyes are especially small...

350
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,811
...and her nose is huge...

351
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,398
...with very sharp teeth like a hound.

352
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:09,151
Very flat chested...seems like
they were run over by a tank.

353
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:11,946
Thank you.

354
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:15,741
Good...yes, very good.

355
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:20,663
You're crazy.

356
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,916
Aren't you? We're two of a kind.

357
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,169
No, we're not the same.

358
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,380
We have different traits.

359
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,674
How different?

360
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,803
The difference between nobleman and lowlife.

361
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,973
Just like a beggar...

362
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,601
...dress up as a prince...

363
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,437
...but inside he's still a beggar!

364
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:48,983
The prostitute from the party last night
just cost two hundred bucks...

365
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,319
...yet you still want her.

366
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,533
All your actions show your lowlife traits.

367
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:10,713
Hello.

368
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,798
This is Liu Xuan...where are you?

369
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:13,633
Home.

370
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:14,592
Where's that?

371
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,011
Guillotine Cliff...Grindstone Mountain...
Green Gulf.

372
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:18,512
I'll pick you up in 10 minutes.

373
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:19,639
Okay-

374
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,098
What is it?

375
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,686
Liu Xuan said he'll pick me up in 10 minutes.

376
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,192
My lowlife traits are like cancer in my bones.

377
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,402
The doctor said it's terminal.

378
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,237
It can't be cured.

379
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,032
What do you mean?

380
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,959
Kill Liu Xuan!

381
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,171
Kill Liu Xuan!

382
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,710
Miss, Mr. Liu sent us to pick you up.

383
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,476
Shan...

384
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,146
Who are you?

385
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,397
I'm her uncle.

386
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,774
Yes, he's my uncle.

387
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,568
You forgot your bag.

388
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,279
Don't waste this chance...have fun.

389
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:41,947
We'll wait for you at home.

390
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,037
What's this?

391
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,541
Mister, it's an octopus I caught.

392
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,501
It escaped earlier.

393
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:54,919
Don't touch it! It's ferocious!

394
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,837
I'll kill it now!

395
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,798
Let me help you.

396
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:00,466
No!

397
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,760
There's bacteria on your knife.

398
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:05,429
Put it down. Be a good boy.
Listen to me, it's alright.

399
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,139
Well done...Uncle loves you.

400
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,975
What are you doing? Stop pulling...

401
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,352
Stop pulling! I can't sell it
if you mess it up.

402
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:13,229
I need it as a whole big piece for BBQ.

403
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,355
Let me help you.

404
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,942
What's up with you again?

405
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,693
Where do all these weapons come from?

406
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,028
Mostly from the internet, also...

407
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,071
Okay, fine!

408
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,073
Let me think again.

409
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,157
No BBQ...

410
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,408
...sashimi would be better.

411
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,702
Mister, let go...let go.

412
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:29,912
Mister...

413
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:31,914
Damn you!

414
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:33,290
Son of a...

415
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,041
Knock it off!

416
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,877
I'm sorry. I've never seen such a big octopus.

417
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:37,670
I'm just too excited!

418
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,047
Excitement is good for young people,

419
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,215
But personally,

420
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,884
I think you should focus your energy on girls...

421
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,971
instead of wasting it on an innocent octopus.

422
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,264
You sick bastard

423
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,181
Yes.

424
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,391
Sorry Uncle.

425
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,986
Boss will be here soon.

426
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,637
Miss, we have to do a security check.

427
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:29,555
Stand up.

428
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:45,404
What's inside your shoes?

429
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:46,280
Nothing!

430
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,407
Please take them off.

431
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,409
No, it's very difficult to take them off!

432
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,370
Don't worry...just put your feet on the table...

433
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,997
...and we'll take them off for you.

434
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:58,959
Please.

435
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:16,685
Hold on!

436
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,323
That's why...it's fine now. I'm sorry.

437
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:38,624
What's this?

438
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,125
Sea urchin.

439
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:44,254
And this?

440
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:46,423
Sea urchins opener

441
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,050
What for?

442
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,259
To eat it!

443
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,929
You always carry around sea urchins to eat?

444
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,306
Is it illegal?

445
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,266
Not illegal!

446
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,519
You scared me to death.

447
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,647
You're being very sneaky
with these glasses of water.

448
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,818
Did you put in poison?

449
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:10,322
I was just kidding!

450
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:13,492
You really scared me to death this time.

451
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,994
That's what I was trying to do.

452
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,620
You scared the crap out of me!

453
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:21,417
Let's have a drink.

454
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,421
Which one is mine?

455
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,256
Don't worry...no one touched them yet.

456
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:27,923
Cheers!

457
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,592
Any problem?

458
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:32,553
No problem.

459
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,871
This lemon is so sour!

460
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,081
I thought you were poisoned...

461
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:02,082
What?

462
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,710
I thought you were poisoned...

463
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,462
Mr. Liao!

464
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:11,258
Stop it!

465
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,301
What are you doing?

466
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,261
He'll be fine if he drinks some alcohol.

467
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,305
Mr. Liao, are you okay?

468
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,389
What happened?

469
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,599
You fainted.

470
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,059
Have some water, Mr. Liao.

471
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,981
Mr. Liao, are you okay?

472
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,525
Just get lost!

473
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:31,195
I'm going to kill you!

474
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:35,199
You worthless pice of...

475
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,869
I could have kill you!

476
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:39,536
Boss.

477
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:40,579
Go to hell!

478
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:30,003
Damn you!

479
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,547
Can't even handle one simple task!

480
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:33,674
Stop standing here like dogs!

481
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:34,883
Idiots!

482
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,677
Get it done now!

483
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,976
Hey you!

484
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,019
Nothing...don't worry about it.

485
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:47,938
What's up?

486
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:56,613
Okay-

487
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:08,792
Mr. Liu, the door is fixed.

488
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:38,906
"Being invincible is lonely, so lonely."

489
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:46,705
"Being invincible is empty, so empty."

490
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,376
"Standing alone on a high mountain top,"

491
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:55,505
"the cold wind blows."

492
00:36:55,631 --> 00:37:02,512
"No one understand my loneliness..."

493
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:09,895
"Being invincible is lonely, so lonely."

494
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:19,071
"Being invincible is empty, so empty."

495
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:27,079
"Will she hear my voice from far away?"

496
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,834
What? What is it?

497
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:40,384
Mr. Liu, you asked me to come...

498
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:41,426
...because you like me, right?

499
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:42,302
Stop!

500
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:46,598
I was not serious about meeting you.

501
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,642
I was just saying it.

502
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:50,185
- I thought you were serious.
- Okay, okay.

503
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,603
Give her $100,000.

504
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:53,355
Just leave!

505
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:55,899
I don't want your money!

506
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,610
You deserved that hit!

507
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,112
You think it's not enough?

508
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:03,573
Here's another $100,000.

509
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,158
Come, let me hit you again!

510
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:06,535
I really don't want your money!

511
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:10,205
You don't want money? You want even more!!!

512
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,708
You haven't even undressed! What do I get?

513
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,001
Any tricks for me?

514
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,752
Sure, with a chicken.

515
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:19,756
Of course with a chicken!

516
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,508
Are you kidding me?

517
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:23,719
You don't think I can do it?

518
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,262
Do what?

519
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:26,847
First you have to pluck it.

520
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:29,766
Pluck it? What for?

521
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:33,103
Of course, you have to pluck it!

522
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:35,147
Really?

523
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,566
Let me show you.

524
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,279
Okay, I can't let you do this!

525
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:44,323
Then you can have a mouthful of
it when you eat it.

526
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,699
What? I have to eat it too?

527
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:49,786
If no plucking and no eating...
then I can't do business with you!

528
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:52,414
I can't take this anymore! Take her away!

529
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:56,793
What are you doing? Let go of me!

530
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,510
In this whole wide world,

531
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:07,637
you're the most beautiful...

532
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,848
...most pure and innocent girl I've ever met.

533
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:11,892
Let's go have some fun.

534
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,895
You changed your mind pretty quick

535
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,691
So what? I just like you!

536
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:21,735
Let's go.

537
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,489
Ruo-lan, you're looking for me?

538
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,783
Nothing important. Just go on
with your business.

539
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:30,786
Then I'll go now. If you need me,
call me anytime.

540
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,288
Take care of Miss Li. I'm leaving.

541
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:36,458
Bitch!

542
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:41,630
So I'm worse than that bitch!

543
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,798
Sorry Miss Li.

544
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,300
Miss Li, would you like anything else?

545
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,426
To hell with you!

546
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,636
I can arrange that!

547
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:48,887
To hell with your mother!

548
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:50,514
Not a problem!

549
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:51,181
Move out of my way!

550
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:51,890
Yes.

551
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,572
Do you want to get out
or shall I throw you out?

552
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,867
Hey...why the sudden change?

553
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,412
What do you want from me?

554
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,205
Just take the money and get lost.

555
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,044
My work place is right ahead.

556
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:21,962
Come and try!

557
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:22,838
What?

558
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:24,798
Trust me! I guarantee you'll like it.

559
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,425
Okay! Stop here.

560
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:31,596
Come on...over there.

561
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,560
Should I wait for you, boss?

562
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,646
You idiot! Can't you see she's crazy?

563
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:40,814
Go!

564
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,320
This smells good.

565
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,256
So, this is the chicken you were talking about?

566
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,049
Of course...what were you thinking?

567
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:10,635
Come and sit.

568
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,804
I thought you meant poached chicken.

569
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:13,805
Here, try!

570
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,684
Why would I eat in such a place like this?

571
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:19,686
Eat...it's very tasty.

572
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,147
Are you kidding me?

573
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:24,024
Trust me!

574
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,840
It's so delicious...it makes you want to cry.

575
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,510
The first time I ate this, I cried too.

576
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,762
This reminds me of my dad.

577
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,931
When I was little...

578
00:41:57,516 --> 00:41:59,017
...my family was so poor.

579
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,729
We had to search for food on the streets.

580
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:04,606
One day...

581
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:08,401
...my dad brought back half a chicken leg.

582
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,161
It tasted just the same as this.

583
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,221
So I was determined that...

584
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:39,224
Your lips are greasy.

585
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:45,397
So I was determined that when I grew up...

586
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,816
...I would make a lot of money.

587
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,859
Why make so much money?

588
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,237
What's more important than money in this world?

589
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,241
What if there's not even a drop of clean water...

590
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,535
...and not a breath of fresh air on this planet?

591
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,538
Wouldn't it be meaningless...
even with so much money?

592
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:03,582
Do...

593
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,001
Do you understand what you're talking about?

594
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:07,752
It's you who doesn't understand.

595
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:11,172
That's why I'm here...right in front of you.

596
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:20,432
Boss.

597
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:24,352
Thank you for buying me the chicken.
Here's 1 million.

598
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:49,127
Who are you? What do you want?

599
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,797
I'm just an ordinary girl. I admire you!

600
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,966
What do you really want?

601
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,760
How about I sing you a song?

602
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,012
There's nothing I haven't seen.

603
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:01,848
Stock market crash in 1987...the financial crisis
in 1997...SARS in 2002.

604
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,516
I survived.

605
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:05,226
I'm tough!

606
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,811
How dare you challenge me?

607
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:15,945
"Being invincible is lonely, so lonely."

608
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:23,370
"Being invincible is empty, so empty."

609
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:32,003
"Standing alone on a high mountain top,
the cold wind blows."

610
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:41,012
"No one understands my loneliness."

611
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:47,310
"Is this the highest mountain in the world?"

612
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:54,401
"Or are there places higher than the sky?"

613
00:44:55,902 --> 00:45:01,157
"Are there places in the world
higher than this mountain?"

614
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:08,206
"But I cannot find one person
more loving than you are."

615
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:15,922
-"No one can compare to you."
-"There are always higher mountains."

616
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:20,176
-"True love is like the sky."
-"Love is higher."

617
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:23,847
"it's incredible"

618
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,529
Okay, Okay...you win!

619
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,452
Your moustache is fake!

620
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,746
Hey, give it back to me!

621
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:50,373
- You are so cute.
- I'm warning you.

622
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:53,334
So stupid.

623
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:56,045
So silly...Let's go play!

624
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:59,799
You're crazy! Why would I want to
play on a spaceship?

625
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,217
Let's fly!

626
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:34,083
You farted!

627
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,752
It was you!

628
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:37,378
Mine smells like this.

629
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,047
That stinks!

630
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:50,058
My place is right ahead.

631
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:54,813
This bay is mine!

632
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,398
This ocean is mine!

633
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,525
Amazing!

634
00:46:58,525 --> 00:46:59,359
Of course!

635
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,860
So everything belongs to you?

636
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,486
Yes!

637
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:03,238
So I'm yours too?

638
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:11,996
Hello?

639
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:15,333
I'm home, thanks.

640
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:19,879
I'll go now.

641
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,339
I'll walk you there.

642
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:00,670
Good night.

643
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,011
Do you want to come in for a cup of tea?

644
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:12,098
Okay-

645
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:30,742
If there's only one minute left in your life...

646
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:32,535
...what would you do?

647
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,914
I would do nothing. Just look at you like now.

648
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,309
Can you see me clearly?

649
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:59,562
Okay, let's not rush it.

650
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:00,939
Let's turn on all the lights inside.

651
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:02,774
Then I can have a good look at you.

652
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,025
I love you.

653
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:14,953
It's late now. You should go!

654
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:28,591
Why did you let him go?

655
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:31,511
I couldn't do it!

656
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:39,727
I'm tired. I'm drying out.

657
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:41,729
I really couldn't do it.

658
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:47,777
We were so close!

659
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:52,073
Liu Xuan is a lucky son of a bitch!

660
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:00,707
Hello?

661
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:08,214
Was that Liu Xuan?

662
00:50:09,966 --> 00:50:10,633
Yes.

663
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:12,885
He wants to take me out tomorrow.

664
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:16,556
We can't mess up this time!

665
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:24,188
Kill Liu Xuan!

666
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:06,856
Hello.

667
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,150
- Hello...
- Hello.

668
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:10,318
You know each other?

669
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:11,319
He's my uncle.

670
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,530
Uncle, it's you!

671
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,990
Yes, it's you again!

672
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,534
Oh, you've got another octopus?

673
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:19,786
I knew you'd be here for teppanyaki...

674
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,663
...so I brought you some fresh ingredients.

675
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:25,208
Please let us.

676
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:25,833
No.

677
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:28,586
Please go ahead. Let's try Uncle's cooking.

678
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:29,337
No way.

679
00:51:33,216 --> 00:51:33,800
Okay-

680
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:35,676
I'll do it.

681
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,568
Your uncle is interesting.

682
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:55,196
He's very proud of his cooking.

683
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:02,787
So full of himself.

684
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:13,881
He loves to perform.

685
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:46,205
What happened?

686
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,124
He flew out.

687
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,668
He also performs magic tricks.

688
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:53,171
Go clean up.

689
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:53,671
Yes.

690
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:54,380
Everyone out!

691
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:05,975
You're not human.

692
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,025
Your hand.

693
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,490
Marry me!

694
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,452
Didn't you say you adored me?

695
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:25,828
I want to marry you.

696
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,834
You got it all wrong.

697
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,127
It's alright.

698
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,296
You wear outdated fashion...

699
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:37,298
...you look funny when you eat.
Also you got a strange walk...

700
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:38,799
...and you talk funny.

701
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,134
So what?

702
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:41,177
I like it!

703
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:43,012
Stop joking around with me!

704
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:45,556
There are so many beautiful women around you.

705
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:48,976
They just want my money, but you don't.

706
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,229
I have everything now...

707
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:52,939
...but I'm lonely.

708
00:53:54,357 --> 00:53:56,525
No one understands me in this world...

709
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:57,818
...but you.

710
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:01,072
But we just met last night!

711
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:04,158
This is my style...efficient,
accurate and fierce.

712
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,703
I make business decisions within seconds,
worth tens of billions...

713
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:10,456
...but I thought about this for the whole night.

714
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,003
Enough! Don't say anymore!

715
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:16,837
<i>..</i>

716
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,051
It's wrong! It's all wrong!

717
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,428
Why are you so foolish?

718
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,347
You're the foolish one!

719
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,766
Do you know how amazing you are?

720
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:31,310
You're not human...you're an angel!

721
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,188
Knowing you is the best thing
that's ever happened to me!

722
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:35,982
Have you ever thought that I was fooling you?

723
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:38,401
Fine, go ahead and fool me...
fool me as long as I live.

724
00:54:38,401 --> 00:54:40,820
Stop! I don't want to hear this!

725
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,571
Don't say anything or I'll change my mind.

726
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,073
I'm suppose to kill you!

727
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:07,388
Out of my sight for one day
and you're reckless again.

728
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:14,854
<i>Sham!</i>

729
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:18,065
I'm losing my patience!

730
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:19,900
I should be the one!

731
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:21,986
Stop stalking me!

732
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,365
Why can't I be here? Why would I stalk you?

733
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,412
Not only do you stalk me...

734
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:32,705
---You bug me too!

735
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,415
Having so much fun?

736
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,666
Our business is worth
tens of billions of dollars.

737
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,418
So what if I bug you?

738
00:55:37,585 --> 00:55:39,920
Getting so close to this strange girl.

739
00:55:40,046 --> 00:55:41,547
I think you're crazy!

740
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:42,965
I want out of this deal!

741
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,259
You want out?

742
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,011
I beg of you.

743
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,471
Do it quick!

744
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:03,569
Octopus...

745
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:07,448
Have you ever thought about cutting off
another tentacle to wear pants?

746
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,784
You think you're so funny?

747
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:11,410
Yes, I'm funny...

748
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:15,664
...but I'm even more romantic.

749
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:16,791
If I want to wear pants...

750
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,876
...I can still do it with three tentacles.

751
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:22,463
See?

752
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:23,672
Right?

753
00:56:23,923 --> 00:56:24,590
Sorry!

754
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:25,800
That's okay!

755
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:29,804
Right now...l only care about killing Liu Xuan.

756
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:33,974
We're always failing! Why is it?

757
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,647
You like him, don't you?

758
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,775
I never liked him!

759
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:47,029
I dare you to look into
my eyes and say it again!

760
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:48,155
Of course I can!

761
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,994
How can I look at you when are you spinning?

762
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:56,539
Who the hell switched on the fan?

763
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:58,833
I did! Don't you feel hot?

764
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,918
No! Switch it off!

765
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,545
Enough!

766
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:05,840
I'm not an actor or a killer!

767
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:07,466
I can't do it!

768
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,717
Who is it?

769
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:22,857
Switch off the fan! Help!

770
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,359
Help! Hurry!

771
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,499
You placed sonars in our ocean!

772
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:42,376
You're responsible for all the deaths!

773
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:44,712
Because of you...

774
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:48,841
...many of us died and we got
separated from our families.

775
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:53,262
Do you know how much damage you've done!

776
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,558
Who gave you the right to destroy our homes?

777
00:57:58,684 --> 00:57:59,602
Today...

778
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:01,854
...we, the mermaids...

779
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,439
...sentence you...

780
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,901
...to the eighteenth level of hell.

781
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:08,235
Execute!

782
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:11,238
Wait!

783
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,782
If you kill me, the sonars will still be there!

784
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:16,702
He's right.

785
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,830
Of course I'm right!

786
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:22,958
I didn't mean to cause you so much pain!

787
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:25,586
Let me go and I'll turn off the sonars!

788
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:27,671
Let me help you this time, okay?

789
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,632
Don't believe him!

790
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:31,759
Kill him!

791
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:36,764
I think he has a point.

792
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:39,433
Now you get it!

793
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,584
Go!

794
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:24,562
Don't tell me you're in love with him.

795
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,674
Mr. Liu.

796
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:55,384
Nice to meet you!

797
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:58,178
What can we do for you?

798
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:00,931
What I'm about to tell you...

799
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:03,392
...don't be scared.

800
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:06,478
Hey, we're the police...
we're not scared of anything.

801
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:07,896
Please begin.

802
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:10,149
I was just...

803
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:12,901
...kidnapped by a mermaid.

804
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:16,614
A mermaid?

805
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:18,490
Yes...a mermaid!

806
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:22,077
Like half human and half fish.

807
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:29,335
Not left and right. It's top and bottom.

808
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,550
Human top and fish bottom.

809
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:39,511
What about the head?

810
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:42,473
Not with that thing!

811
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:55,986
It's a girl!

812
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:58,656
Damn it...mermaids!

813
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,240
Are you making fun of me?

814
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,284
With long hair and a nice figure.

815
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:05,204
Swims with a fish tail...got it?

816
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:07,081
Got it. Please continue.

817
01:01:07,206 --> 01:01:08,415
She came to me.

818
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:10,376
She said she liked me and wanted to date me.

819
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:12,670
Then she kidnapped me...somewhere in Green Gulf.

820
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:13,754
There were mermaids everywhere...

821
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:14,963
...and an octopus too.

822
01:01:15,214 --> 01:01:17,007
An octopus! Scared?

823
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,467
You heard me?

824
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:19,885
He tried to strangle me with his tentacle.

825
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:20,678
Shan picked up a knife...

826
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:21,929
...and chopped off his tentacle.

827
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:22,888
I ran and ran...

828
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:23,931
Then I jumped into the sea.

829
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:30,729
What are you laughing at?

830
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:32,940
I was just having some happy thoughts.

831
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,149
What happy thoughts?

832
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,026
My wife just had a baby.

833
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:39,071
And you? What are you laughing at?

834
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,116
My wife also just had a baby.

835
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:45,786
Your wives are the same person?

836
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:47,371
Right...right.

837
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:55,629
No...they both gave birth on the same day.

838
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:57,256
Let me make myself clear.

839
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,299
I'm not lying!

840
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:00,008
Right...right.

841
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:04,847
Let's get back to the case.

842
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,558
That...that creature you just mentioned.

843
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:08,642
Mermaid.

844
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,519
Was she pretty?

845
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:12,771
It doesn't matter whether she's pretty or not!

846
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:14,773
She's one of a kind...

847
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,359
...that's rarely seen.

848
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:21,363
Her eyes are like peas...

849
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:23,365
...with a garlic shaped nose...

850
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:25,033
...and sharp teeth.

851
01:02:25,868 --> 01:02:27,244
She's very cute.

852
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,747
Too bad it was dark that night...

853
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:31,498
...to take a good look at her breasts.

854
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:34,710
What is it with you? I'm losing my patience!

855
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:35,794
My wife had a baby.

856
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,755
Do you think I'm that stupid?
I know you're laughing at me!

857
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,757
Mr. Liu, we're professionals.

858
01:02:39,757 --> 01:02:42,092
We won't laugh...no matter how crazy it is...

859
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:43,260
...unless we can't take it.

860
01:02:43,302 --> 01:02:44,470
Mr. Liu, how about...

861
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:45,971
...you go back home and rest first.

862
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:48,056
We'll let you know once we find out anything.

863
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,808
Alright, please do something!

864
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:50,559
Bring more enforcements!

865
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,019
We need to corner them!

866
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,528
Mr. Liu, anything else?

867
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,370
Mr. Liu?

868
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:17,127
I believe you.

869
01:03:17,169 --> 01:03:19,046
You're a tycoon with trillions.

870
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:21,840
Why would you make up
such a crazy story to fool me?

871
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:23,717
Only lunatics wouldn't believe you.

872
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:26,845
By the way, I know a great psychiatrist.

873
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:28,263
I'll ask him to come over!

874
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:31,683
Why are you calling a psychiatrist?

875
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:32,893
To have some fun together.

876
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:34,478
Okay, you think I'm crazy too!

877
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,939
Damn it! You don't believe me!

878
01:03:36,939 --> 01:03:39,399
You don't believe me! You don't believe me!

879
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:40,234
Here you are!

880
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:43,195
Where have you been? I've been so worried!

881
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:55,791
I meant well...earlier on.

882
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,669
What I said, I didn't really mean it.

883
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:01,588
Look at you. You're like a child.

884
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:10,138
You have such beautiful legs.

885
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:13,559
Not only are my legs beautiful...

886
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:16,103
...there's much more to be discovered.

887
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:19,147
Let me see.

888
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:32,953
Octopus, what should we do now?

889
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:36,915
Wait for death to come.

890
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:40,127
I didn't expect to be betrayed like this.

891
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:52,306
To save the one you love...

892
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:54,308
...you're willing to sacrifice everything.

893
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,184
This is your nature.

894
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,854
You shouldn't blame yourself.

895
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,815
A mermaid falling in love with an evil human.

896
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:03,567
Is there no justice?

897
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:06,153
Love has no law.

898
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:10,991
It is beyond any rules or boundaries.

899
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,785
In the Ming Dynasty over 600 years ago...

900
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:17,164
...we barely escaped from
the seven attacks of the human navies.

901
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,168
Thanks to the generous help of Mr. Zheng.

902
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:24,087
Otherwise, we would have been extinct.

903
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,508
Human beings can be evil...

904
01:05:29,635 --> 01:05:32,930
...but there are good ones too.

905
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:35,015
Love is all around.

906
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,518
Love is patience.

907
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:45,359
It can stand the test of time...never ending.

908
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:04,252
You've been watching this
for two hours already.

909
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:06,505
Still want to watch the kiddie shows?

910
01:06:07,214 --> 01:06:08,465
Are we destroying the environment?

911
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:11,635
Don't you want to see something
more interesting? Come over here.

912
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:15,138
haosou.com

913
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:25,732
You've seen all these already?

914
01:06:26,066 --> 01:06:27,275
Why do you care so much about these mermaids?

915
01:06:28,944 --> 01:06:32,197
There are many things you don't know about me.

916
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:35,242
Come over here and I'll show you.

917
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:38,412
I have to go. It's urgent!

918
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:39,579
Don't you dare!

919
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,584
Do you realise how lucky you are?

920
01:06:45,711 --> 01:06:48,422
Don't miss this chance.

921
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:04,271
I'm sorry!

922
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:06,481
I really have to go. It's urgent.

923
01:07:08,734 --> 01:07:10,485
I'm deeply touched.

924
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:11,820
Thanks for your offer.

925
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:12,904
Come back here!

926
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:15,407
I'll call you soon, real soon!

927
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:16,616
Come back!

928
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:37,471
Let me try the sonar.

929
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:46,313
We will now activate the sonar.

930
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,732
I have to warn you first...

931
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,567
Just cut the crap!

932
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:00,035
Ready?

933
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:03,371
Go ahead!

934
01:08:14,049 --> 01:08:14,633
Stop!

935
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,182
Mr.Liu, are you okay?

936
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:23,183
Ow...my head!

937
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:25,185
Damn it! I crapped my pants!

938
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:27,062
That's a normal reaction.

939
01:08:27,062 --> 01:08:28,897
I tried to warn you but you didn't let me.

940
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:32,192
In fact, we reduced it to
one tenth of its power.

941
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:33,360
That's impossible!

942
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,446
Mr. Liu, why do you
want to turn off the sonars?

943
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:38,907
The sonar...

944
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:43,537
...is too powerful!

945
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,413
You're really funny.

946
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:48,792
Look...your work has already started!
You designed the sonar!

947
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:51,253
I tried it and I crapped my pants!

948
01:08:51,253 --> 01:08:53,713
Human waste is not our expertise.

949
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,674
I want it turned off! Authorize it now!

950
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:57,175
- We can't do that!
-It's not possible.

951
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:58,677
What's the matter?

952
01:08:58,760 --> 01:08:59,386
Boss.

953
01:08:59,386 --> 01:09:01,096
Mr. Liu wants to turn off the sonars...

954
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:02,722
...and talking about faeces.

955
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:03,807
- That's disgusting!
- I'm sorry.

956
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:06,351
We don't understand what he's thinking.

957
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,812
No surprise. We'll never know
what he's thinking.

958
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:10,814
I agree. Turn off the sonars.

959
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:21,449
All sonars have been switched off.

960
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:22,200
Good!

961
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:26,746
Thank you, Ruo-Lan.

962
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:27,956
You're welcome.

963
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,668
You know that I'm always on your side.

964
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:33,712
You must have your reasons.

965
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:36,464
Can you tell me why you're doing this?

966
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:39,134
The sonars are deadly. I crapped my pants.

967
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:43,346
Well done, you figured it out.

968
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:53,356
Mermaids really do exist.

969
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,109
That girl, Shan...is one of them...

970
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,069
...and there's more of them!

971
01:09:58,153 --> 01:09:59,571
An octopus too!

972
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:00,739
And so?

973
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,782
Our sonars are harming the environment...

974
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,201
...and destroying all marine life.

975
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:05,744
Where are they now?

976
01:10:05,744 --> 01:10:07,078
Green Gulf.

977
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:10,123
Inside the wreck on Guillotine Cliff.

978
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:15,337
That's why I didn't want to tell you!
I really regret it!

979
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:16,421
I believe you!

980
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:23,637
Living mermaids located!

981
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:25,972
...in that wreck in Green Gulf.

982
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:27,682
Oh my God!

983
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:37,776
What is this place? What are you doing, George?

984
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:40,779
Sorry, he's working for me now.

985
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:44,699
George is not only a world
famous marine biologist...

986
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:47,619
...he's also a nutcase like you.

987
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:50,372
He's been looking for mermaids for a long time.

988
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:52,499
I'm backing his research.

989
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:55,710
Why didn't you tell me?

990
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:15,021
We've actually found two mermaids...

991
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,815
...but they were dead unfortunatly...

992
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:21,528
We've located that wreck...

993
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,530
...and there're signs of mermaid activity.

994
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:24,614
Let's go get them!

995
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:30,662
Turning off the sonars is good enough.
Why still go after them?

996
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:32,497
Are you crazy?

997
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,209
Mermaids...new species.

998
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:38,253
If we could extract their DNA...

999
01:11:38,253 --> 01:11:40,922
...then we would have the
most advanced biotechnology.

1000
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:43,425
It's a huge opportunity. You should know that!

1001
01:11:43,425 --> 01:11:46,177
- But...
- Money! Making money!

1002
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:47,762
Don't you want money?

1003
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:49,180
Yes, I want money!

1004
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:53,518
But there has to be a limit.

1005
01:11:53,852 --> 01:11:55,228
We can't go against our moral conscience!

1006
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:56,396
Conscience?

1007
01:11:57,355 --> 01:12:01,359
Earth's welfare and world peace could
rely on you then, Mr. Conscience!

1008
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:02,235
I survived that sonar!

1009
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:03,653
To hell with the sonar!

1010
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:06,614
You only care about that woman!

1011
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:09,117
I'm rich and gorgeous.

1012
01:12:09,117 --> 01:12:11,661
There's lots of men who find me desirable.

1013
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:15,457
I spent 3O billion on you,
but you treat me like dirt...

1014
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:16,958
...and go chasing some tail!

1015
01:12:17,876 --> 01:12:18,585
<i>..</i>

1016
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:23,340
Now I'm going to hunt her down
and make fish soup out of her!

1017
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:38,188
Mermaids...

1018
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:40,482
...are highly intelligent unknown species.

1019
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,317
They're fierce...

1020
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:44,527
...and capable of making weapons.

1021
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,279
They're extremely dangerous...

1022
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,656
...so as soon as you see them...

1023
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:51,034
...use full force!

1024
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:53,036
Take pre-emptive action.

1025
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:55,205
Attack them until they cannot fight back.

1026
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:57,707
I'd rather have them all dead,
than let one escape.

1027
01:13:03,755 --> 01:13:04,547
Boss!

1028
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:07,801
We've got 300 security enforcements.

1029
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:08,968
They're ready to set off any time.

1030
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,388
We'll shutting down
Rue-Ian's secret laboratory.

1031
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:12,347
No one can get in anymore.

1032
01:13:12,514 --> 01:13:13,473
Now, do you believe me?

1033
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:14,057
Now I do.

1034
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:15,350
I still can't get in touch with Shan.

1035
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:16,976
Keep calling her.

1036
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,228
Make sure the enforcements get there quickly!

1037
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:19,979
Boss, please be careful with my car.

1038
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:21,231
I only have three in this model.

1039
01:13:21,523 --> 01:13:23,024
Let me get this straight.

1040
01:13:23,108 --> 01:13:25,235
Going against Ruo-lan is like
going against money.

1041
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:27,821
But we're business men. If we go against money...

1042
01:13:27,946 --> 01:13:29,989
...then those jets, yachts, and Romanée Conti...

1043
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:31,533
...are all meaningless, right?

1044
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:33,535
Right!

1045
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:31,676
Great! Force them out of the water!

1046
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:34,053
Target under water!

1047
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:39,517
Fire!

1048
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,287
Move!

1049
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,459
Is anyone in charge?

1050
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:06,920
Where are the police?

1051
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:52,590
Bingg!

1052
01:19:11,122 --> 01:19:13,750
The sonars are off! It's safe now!

1053
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:16,836
Quick, jump! Go all the way down!

1054
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:19,672
It's safe now...let's go!

1055
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:24,385
He wasn't lying.

1056
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:30,224
They're over there!

1057
01:19:57,168 --> 01:19:57,877
Right there!

1058
01:20:04,509 --> 01:20:05,802
Out of the way!

1059
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:14,227
Go...hurry!

1060
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:35,957
Give it to me!

1061
01:20:38,835 --> 01:20:39,460
Damn it!

1062
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,690
Go...go!

1063
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:48,279
You're stuck too? What about the helicopter?

1064
01:21:48,613 --> 01:21:51,157
The pilot is what? Stuck in traffic too?

1065
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:53,367
Go to hell!

1066
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,330
Stop!

1067
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:00,374
Take my cash and car for the bike.

1068
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:01,167
No way!

1069
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,210
I'm rushing to my client for her manicure.

1070
01:22:03,711 --> 01:22:05,880
It's a Lamborghini, for godsake!
Forget about your stupid job!

1071
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:07,632
Here's a building for you...

1072
01:22:07,632 --> 01:22:09,050
...worth several billion dollars, okay?

1073
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,136
That's all I have. My final offer!

1074
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:13,763
'IO billion!

1075
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:19,977
Mr. Liu...

1076
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,316
Trying to pick up a manicure
chick on the street...

1077
01:22:25,316 --> 01:22:27,151
...for 10 billion!

1078
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:30,363
Cheng!

1079
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:41,082
Kill her!

1080
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:44,251
Quick!

1081
01:22:57,682 --> 01:22:59,016
Whoever wants to harm her...

1082
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:01,018
...First get thru me!

1083
01:23:08,985 --> 01:23:10,403
Never mind him! Go on!

1084
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:23,290
Damn you bitch!

1085
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:24,333
You actually pulled the trigger!

1086
01:23:28,838 --> 01:23:29,755
I'll send you home!

1087
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:45,563
Damn bitch!

1088
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:48,983
Forget me.

1089
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:52,194
Don't worry...I'll protect you.

1090
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:10,129
Just leave me.

1091
01:24:13,424 --> 01:24:14,759
No.

1092
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:38,884
My name is Long Jianfei.

1093
01:25:38,926 --> 01:25:40,886
Thank you very much for seeing me.

1094
01:25:41,053 --> 01:25:44,390
I was the first winner of the scholarship you
set up three years ago.

1095
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:46,725
My schoolmates and I want to
express our deepest gratitude.

1096
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:49,436
We all think that you're a great man.

1097
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:50,563
No...

1098
01:25:50,938 --> 01:25:53,399
You used to be such a successful entrepreneur.

1099
01:25:53,774 --> 01:25:57,570
Why did you donate all your money
to protect the environment?

1100
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,532
If there's not even a drop of clean water...

1101
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:03,200
...and not a breath of fresh air on this planet...

1102
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:06,245
...then it would be meaningless no matter
how much money you make.

1103
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:09,790
Yes, that's so true.

1104
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:12,251
So the mermaids...

1105
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:13,252
There are no mermaids.

1106
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:17,715
People say you deny the existence
of mermaids to protect them.

1107
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,718
After you survived that fateful day...

1108
01:26:20,718 --> 01:26:22,469
...you stayed alone...

1109
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:23,888
...waiting for the mermaid to come back.

1110
01:26:23,888 --> 01:26:25,306
This sounds like a movie.

1111
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:26,807
Mr. Liu, please take a look at this photo.

1112
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:44,241
Actually, I don't mean to offend you
with these questions.

1113
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:46,660
As a marine biology student...

1114
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:50,623
...these new findings are very important.

1115
01:26:51,457 --> 01:26:54,335
Scientists should be more objective...

1116
01:26:55,294 --> 01:26:58,130
...so don't believe in fairy tales.

1117
01:26:58,214 --> 01:26:59,131
And...

1118
01:27:00,674 --> 01:27:02,092
...I'm not alone either.

1119
01:27:03,636 --> 01:27:04,345
Lucy!

1120
01:27:04,637 --> 01:27:05,804
I'm cooking!

1121
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:07,181
Come here.

1122
01:27:07,348 --> 01:27:08,807
Okay-

1123
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,937
Lucy

1124
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:13,938
Hello.

1125
01:27:14,313 --> 01:27:14,980
Hello.

1126
01:27:16,357 --> 01:27:18,984
We live an ordinary life.

1127
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:22,613
Sometimes we cook together.

1128
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:23,948
Have tea together.

1129
01:27:24,949 --> 01:27:25,658
What else?

1130
01:27:25,658 --> 01:27:27,159
We also travel.

1131
01:27:28,494 --> 01:27:30,329
I understand.

1132
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:32,164
Go and explore new places.

1133
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:34,708
The sceneries are beautiful!

1134
01:27:36,627 --> 01:27:38,212
Very beautiful.
