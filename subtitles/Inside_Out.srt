00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,637
So, how was the first day of school?

3
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,495
It was find, I guess...

4
00:00:13,745 --> 00:00:14,890
I don't know.

5
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:18,185
Do you ever look at someone and wonder
what is going on inside their head?

6
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:22,147
- Did you guys pick up on that?
- Sure did. Something's wrong.

7
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:24,796
We're gonna find out what's happening,
but we'll need support.

8
00:00:25,046 --> 00:00:26,193
Signal the husband.

9
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,075
He's passed over to Reed,
comes across center ice...

10
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:36,984
Huh-oh.
She's looking at us.

11
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,457
- What did she say?
- Oh, sorry sir, no one was listening.

12
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,918
Is it garbage night?
We left the toilet sit up?!

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,753
What?! What is it, woman?! What?!

14
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,004
Signal him again...

15
00:00:50,762 --> 00:00:52,636
So, Riley, how was school?

16
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,659
- Seriously?!
- He's gotta be kidding me!

17
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:57,391
For this, we gave up
that Brazilian helicopter pilot?!

18
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,898
School was great, all right?

19
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:07,818
What was that?! I though you said
we were gonna "act casual"?!

20
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,486
Riley! Is everything okay?

21
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:12,072
She just rolled her eyes at us!

22
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,450
All right, make a show of force, I don't
want to have to put the foot down.

23
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:17,452
No! Not the foot...

24
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:19,788
Riley, I do not like
this new attitude.

25
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:23,333
- Oh, I show you attitude, old man!
- No! No, no, no! Breath!

26
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:25,711
What is your problem?!
Just leave me alone!

27
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,295
Reporting high levels of sass!

28
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:28,880
Take it to DEFCON 2!

29
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:29,965
DEFCON 2!

30
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:33,051
I don't know where this
disrespectful attitude came from.

31
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,635
You want a piece of this, pops?!

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,013
Yeah, well...

33
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,199
Prepare the foot!

34
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,141
Keys to safety position!

35
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:42,477
Ready to launch on your command, sir!

36
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,398
Just shut up!

37
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:47,607
Fire!

38
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,715
That's it!
Go to your room!

39
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,404
The foot is down.
The foot is down.

40
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:57,409
Good job, gentleman.
That could have been a disaster.

41
00:01:57,943 --> 00:01:59,743
Well, that was a disaster.

42
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,252
Come!
Fly with me, Caccinia.
