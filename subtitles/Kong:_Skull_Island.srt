00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,918
<i>If we can put this
tremendous machine of ours...</i>

4
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:17,829
<i>which has made this victory possieble...</i>

5
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:20,255
<i>To work for peace...</i>

6
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:24,534
<i>We can look forward to the greatest age
in the history of mankind</i>

7
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:36,379
<i>Speed of progress in the satellite project</i>

8
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:39,750
<i>Can not be taken as an index
of our progress...</i>

9
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:41,313
<i>in ballistic missiles.</i>

10
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,190
<i>I feel we are on the brink
of an areal expansion...</i>

11
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,630
<i>of knowledge about ourselves
and our surroundings..</i>

12
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:52,925
<i>Those are beyond description of
comprehension this time.</i>

13
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:59,440
<i>For the first time,
we are putting cameras in the space...</i>

14
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,534
<i>and looking down on the Earth...</i>

15
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:06,268
<i>allowing us to discover places, things
we never seen before.</i>

16
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,414
<i>The most intelligent inhabitants
of the future world...</i>

17
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:13,737
<i>won't be man or monkeys.</i>

18
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:15,163
<i>That Will be machines.</i>

19
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,148
<i>We set sail on this new sea...</i>

20
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:22,710
<i>because there is new knowledge to be gained.</i>

21
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,645
<i>Whether this new ocean...</i>

22
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,736
<i>will be a sea of â€‹â€‹peace...</i>

23
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:30,435
<i>or a new terrifying theater of war.</i>

24
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:35,495
<i>"To tame the savageness of man...</i>

25

<i>" And nature, hope the life of this world."</i>

26
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:40,744
<i>Let us dedicate ourselves to that.</i>

27
00:04:58,711 --> 00:04:59,812
<i>The city wide protests have...</i>

28
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,814
<i>Promising more gridlocks
in the days of weeks ahead...</i>

29
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:09,158
Mark my words

30
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:12,079
There will never be a more
screwed up time in Washington.

31
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,567
But we can't let it stop us.

32
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:23,902
Maybe now is not the best time to ask

33
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:26,435
Monarch is on the cast of being shut down

34
00:05:26,737 --> 00:05:27,737
Brooks. We are broke!

35
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:28,796
When this war ends,

36
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:31,190
we will never get approval
for our expedition.

37
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:36,568
I am not confident in our presentation.

38
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:38,802
I mean all of our material are loose slip.

39
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:40,800
In one day, one day...

40
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,911
I could have all this organized.

41
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:46,700
That we today,
have concluded an agreement...

42
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:50,338
to end the war
and bring peace with honor in Vietnam.

43
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:53,039
all American forces will be withdraw.

44
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,621
We don't have a day.

45
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,161
Hello there.

46
00:05:56,664 --> 00:05:58,418
Bill Randa here to see Senator Willis.

47
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,118
Of course, Mr. Randa.

48
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,702
I left you a message this morning about
rescheduling today's appointment

49
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:07,654
But he should have some thing available
in the coming weeks.

50
00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:11,357
God.

51
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,596
Al, you looking well.

52
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:14,561
You didn't get the message, Randa?

53
00:06:14,761 --> 00:06:17,333
- To reschedule?
- For the fifth time? I must have missed

54
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:18,933
It'll be quick.

55
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:21,775
Don't get comfortable. You got five minutes.

56
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:23,018
I'm late for a meeting.

57
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:26,163
What imaginary monster
are you hunting this time?

58
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,364
This is a satellite photo...

59
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:30,752
of an uncharted island in the South Pacific.

60
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:34,293
It has defied discovery until now.

61
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,054
Many civilizations spoke of it in legends.

62
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,403
Skull Island.

63
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:43,649
The land where God did not finish creation.

64
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:45,404
It is notorious for the...

65
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,839
of ships and planes that
have gone missing there.

66
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:50,356
Like the Bermuda Triangle?

67
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:56,057
Or like that baloon foil hat that
I like to wear in the weekends?

68
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:58,453
It's more like the triangle in the hat...

69
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:01,047
but we like to think
it's much more than that.

70
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:04,398
The 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear test...

71
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,168
Wasn't test.

72
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,803
They were trying to kill something.

73
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:13,233
I believe there is an ecosystem out there
in the likes of which we can't imagine

74
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:16,495
And the place to find it is this island.

75
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:19,828
A place where myth and science meet.

76
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:22,555
Randa it's a fairy tale.

77
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:30,896
Harry Truman didn't think so
when he funded Monarch in 1946.

78
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:32,696
In terms of sheer waste...

79
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:35,619
Monarch ranks right up here
in the search for alien life.

80
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,802
Yeah, but those guys are nuts.

81
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:41,288
We should have shut it down years ago.

82
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:43,575
This is an opportunity for our country.

83
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:46,970
Listen, Senator,
Landsat is setting a mission to the Island

84
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:49,453
We should piggybank on that operation.

85
00:07:49,655 --> 00:07:51,347
With your permission, of course.

86
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:52,738
What are you hoping to find?

87
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:56,865
Resources, medicine,
the cure for cancer, geological discoveries.

88
00:07:57,824 --> 00:07:59,815
The Possible alternative fuels, Senator...

89
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,020
Listen, to be honest...

90
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:03,782
we do not know for sure what's in there.

91
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:06,181
Okay. But I'll tell you what we do know.

92
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:09,144
Tomorrow night, the Russian Novosat
passes over this sector.

93
00:08:09,347 --> 00:08:11,594
In three days, they are gonna have
the same images as we have

94
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:14,150
So whatever's there...

95
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:17,865
You want us to find it first.

96
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:19,773
Right?

97
00:08:22,473 --> 00:08:24,869
I don't believe I'm saying this...

98
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:26,510
but that almost makes sense.

99
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:28,240
Thank you.

100
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,249
So I will get the piggybank for you. I will

101
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:33,744
But listen to me. this is it.

102
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,478
It's gotta end. This is it

103
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:38,582
You promise me? The last favor? ok?

104
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:41,378
Senator?

105
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,204
One last thing.

106
00:08:46,582 --> 00:08:48,789
I am going to need a military escort.

107
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:20,591
- Hey, Mills.
- Yeah?

108
00:09:20,747 --> 00:09:21,947
How many letters did you end up writing her?

109
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:24,481
Ten, fifteen.

110
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:25,628
How many letters she write you?

111
00:09:25,827 --> 00:09:26,827
I don't know, three, four.

112
00:09:28,643 --> 00:09:29,931
man, you got a shitty mom.

113
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,401
I'll be trying to telling her
when I see her in the next 48 hours.

114
00:09:36,602 --> 00:09:37,922
hey, Mile have a shitty mom.

115
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:39,836
Right?

116
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:05,213
Sir?

117
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:06,823
chapman

118
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,758
Do you need anything, sir?

119
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:13,389
Roger that

120
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:18,134
What are you gonna do
when you get back to the world, chapman

121
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:21,237
I am already set up with
the Eastern Air Lines.

122
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:24,156
Grace and Billy all moved in Atlanta...

123
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,415
Waiting on me.

124
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:28,115
That's you sir?

125
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,599
All this for what?

126
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:32,802
Sir?

127
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:37,772
Get out of here, chapman. Go have some fun.

128
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:40,429
Everything okay?

129
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,607
Tip top

130
00:10:57,046 --> 00:11:00,991
Colonel Packard!
There's a phone call for you.

131
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:05,102
This is Packard.

132
00:11:05,204 --> 00:11:06,733
Packard, General Ward.

133
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,002
You and your boys up of one last op?

134
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:11,052
I would not be opposed to that, sir.

135
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:13,226
Yours order to head home
are already processed.

136
00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:14,896
Sure you do not want to take some time?

137
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:17,769
I'm here to execute
whatever orders I'm given, sir.

138
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,169
Don't get too excited.

139
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,935
The scientists on Landsat
discovered a new island on their Satellite.

140
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:26,437
They need helicopter
transport for a survey job.

141
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:28,796
Roger that. And sir?

142
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:29,897
Yes?

143
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:31,339
Thank you.

144
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:43,080
Randa, I do not get it.
You already got us a military escort.

145
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:44,641
Why do we need a tracker? And why SAS?

146
00:11:44,714 --> 00:11:45,714
<i>SAIGON DISTRICT-GUANNÃM</i>

147
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:48,725
Former SAS.
No links to anyone.

148
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:51,818
And he rescued 12 pilots
in Danang, at 72.

149
00:11:52,018 --> 00:11:54,384
But your source says that
he spends most of his working hours...

150
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,359
Is your Yale degrees supposed to
lead us though the Jungle, Brooks?

151
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,377
My father told me never judge a man
by where he drinks...

152
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,957
Only how he hold it.

153
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,065
You aren't bored with me here?

154
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,285
You go.

155
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,307
Well. Okay.

156
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:20,676
So, How much did you tell him?

157
00:12:20,877 --> 00:12:22,993
Just Enough to get him to say yes.

158
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,227
Now there is a man worth talking to.

159
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:00,945
An uncharted island?

160
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,603
Let me list all they ways you gonna die.

161
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:07,377
Rain, heat, mud, disease carrying flies
and mosquitoes.

162
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,036
Sure you could load up on the
Atabrine for the malaria...

163
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:11,634
but what about the other bacteria?

164
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:15,707
I mean how I even started on the things
that want to eat you alive.

165
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:17,007
We'll double then.

166
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:19,734
I have no idea how dangerous this is.

167
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:21,396
I want five times that.

168
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:24,767
Plus a bonus if we make it back.

169
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:25,869
If?

170
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:29,345
Pay him.

171
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:33,490
I think Mr. Conrad should
be fairly compensating.

172
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:37,490
Here is to profit during peace.

173
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,691
One question.

174
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:41,659
You came here looking
for a tracker.

175
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,183
Who or what am I tracking?

176
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:47,743
This is all the
information that we have.

177
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:49,181
Okay? There is no map.

178
00:13:49,382 --> 00:13:50,809
Only satellite images.

179
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:52,677
So we need someone like you...

180
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:56,565
with your skill, and unique expertise
in unchartered jungle terrain...

181
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:58,686
To lead us on our ground expedition.

182
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:02,289
We are just scholers and scientists.
We need someone with experience.

183
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:05,354
In case things go sideways.

184
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:08,920
Men go to war in search
of something, Mr. Conrad.

185
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:12,586
If you would found it...

186
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:14,439
you would be home by now.

187
00:14:35,821 --> 00:14:37,199
- Weaver.
- Yeah, it's Jerry.

188
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:38,401
Hey, Jerry.

189
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:39,899
Tell me, do we get it?

190
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,684
That Landsat thing?
You got it

191
00:14:41,785 --> 00:14:42,788
I did?

192
00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:45,374
Hello?

193
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:46,946
there is the Athena docked in Bangkok.

194
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:50,027
Pier 14, 6'o clock tomorrow night.

195
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:51,682
1800 tomorrow.

196
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:54,190
Thank you. I really owe you one.

197
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,002
I don't get it. Why do you want a
gig documenting a mapping mission?

198
00:14:57,204 --> 00:14:58,604
When you're at the cover of Time?

199
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,999
Jerry, when three sources
tell you the same thing word for word...

200
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:03,825
You know they are lying.

201
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:08,200
There is something going on here,
something that nobody is talking.

202
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:15,128
<i>BANGKOK, THAILAND</i>

203
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:17,485
<i>PIER 14</i>

204
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,439
I can not believe we're doing this.

205
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,782
A day away?

206
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:35,215
One day away!

207
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,236
And no, now we gotta go to another Island...

208
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:39,902
with another jungle.

209
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:42,372
Vietnam is not a island, Dumbass.

210
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:43,935
Key West is...

211
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:46,198
and that's exactly where
I need to be right now,

212
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:47,325
with a drink in my hand.

213
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:50,489
Key West ain't an island, either.
It's a key.

214
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,788
You ain't funny, Cole.

215
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:08,727
Mason Weaver, photographer.

216
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:11,783
Mason Weaver is a woman?

217
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:14,103
last time I checked

218
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:19,154
Can I help you?

219
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:25,705
Two years in the country.
Where have you been?

220
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:27,504
Embedded with MAC V-SOG.

221
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:29,465
You in the shit.

222
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,177
I respect that.

223
00:16:31,377 --> 00:16:34,858
Cause people like you,
lost us support back home.

224
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:37,486
You aren't actually gonna blame
the people without guns...

225
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:39,086
For loosing the war, are you?

226
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,583
Camera is way more dangerous than a gun.

227
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:43,414
And we did not lose the war...

228
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:45,046
We are abondaning.

229
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:46,582
Right.

230
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:54,992
Hello and welcome.

231
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:58,610
I am Lansat field supervisor,
Victor Nieves

232
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:01,626
this is my collegue, Steve Woodward
Our data wrangler

233
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:04,975
Our expedition takes
us to a place...

234
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:09,031
Every nautical trade route known to man
has avoided for centuries.

235
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:11,168
As our satellite shows...

236
00:17:11,368 --> 00:17:14,640
the island is surrounded
by a perpetual storm system

237
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:18,074
Allowing it to remain hidden
from the outside world.

238
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:20,974
But with Colonel Packard's
helicopter transport.

239
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:23,964
we will be the first to break
through to the other side.

240
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:27,259
We, are also pleased to be
joined for the fisrt time

241
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,587
By the resource exploration team...

242
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:31,068
led by Mr. Randa...

243
00:17:31,157 --> 00:17:33,564
and the company by biologist,
Ms. San...

244
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:35,405
and geologist, Mr. Brooks.

245
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:37,956
Our focus will be on
the Island surface

246
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:40,491
There is, what lies beneath.

247
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,692
Mr Brooks.

248
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:43,178
Simple really

249
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,003
We are using explosives to shake the earth,
and create vibrations...

250
00:17:46,203 --> 00:17:48,854
Helping us to map the sub
surface of the island.

251
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:52,019
We will fly over the south shore and
then strategically drop seismic chargers

252
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,504
that will help us understand
the density of the earth.

253
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:55,705
You are dropping bombs?

254
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:58,752
Scientific instruments.

255
00:17:58,973 --> 00:17:59,973
Do you hear that, boys?

256
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:01,879
we are scientists, now

257
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:04,772
You guys are not scientists.

258
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:06,802
We'll then land, and make base camp...

259
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:09,783
for ground excursions led by Mr. Conrad.

260
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,094
Me to Jack Chapman.

261
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:13,240
All right. Once on the island...

262
00:18:13,444 --> 00:18:15,906
the storm interfarence will block
all radio contact with the ship.

263
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:18,020
That means, we will be by ourselves

264
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
Three days later, refuel team will meet us
here on north of the Island...

265
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:22,410
north of the island.

266
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:24,291
That might be our only safe departure...

267
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:25,861
for unknown period.

268
00:18:27,035 --> 00:18:28,517
So a tip for everybody...

269
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:31,217
Don't miss it, please.

270
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:53,907
What are you doing down here?

271
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,536
I could ask you the same thing.

272
00:18:57,949 --> 00:19:00,318
Why does a geological mapping mission
needs explosives.

273
00:19:02,654 --> 00:19:04,941
Seismic charges for the geological survey.

274
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:06,740
And you believe that?

275
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:08,333
I did not say that.

276
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:10,383
Have you met Colonel Packard yet?

277
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:11,584
Yeah.

278
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,233
The guy bound pretty tight

279
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:16,733
But as a decorated war hero.
It's the package they come in

280
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:18,533
And you?

281
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:22,701
Isn't shooting a mapping mission
start down for a photojournalist?

282
00:19:22,903 --> 00:19:24,986
The right photo help shape opinions.

283
00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:26,687
And win you a Pulitzer.

284
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:28,983
Well, Captain Conrad.

285
00:19:29,183 --> 00:19:30,283
What about you?

286
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:32,715
How did British Special
forces get dragged into this?

287
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:34,719
Just Conrad. I'm decommissioned.

288
00:19:36,561 --> 00:19:37,735
They offered me money.

289
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:39,425
You don't strike me as a mercenary.

290
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:41,416
You don't strike me as a war photographer.

291
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,124
Anti war photographer.

292
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,516
What are you writing there, Chap?

293
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:08,435
Letter to my boy.

294
00:20:08,536 --> 00:20:09,934
<i>DEAR BILLY</i>

295
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:12,235
"Dear Billy...

296
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:14,208
"I know I said I would at
be home by your birthday,

297
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:15,511
but I lied straight to your face.

298
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:16,984
"I'm a terrible dad.

299
00:20:17,186 --> 00:20:18,626
"I hope this letter makes out for you".

300
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,382
It's too short.

301
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:50,853
This storm look a lot
max near in person.

302
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:53,390
maybe we should consider
postponing the mission.

303
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,094
How far away is this island?

304
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,251
50 miles. maybe more.

305
00:20:57,352 --> 00:20:58,716
Take us closer.

306
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:00,411
You wanna launch, do it from here.

307
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:02,251
Can you punch through that, Colonel?

308
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,620
- Our opening is now.
- Bring This whole right here?

309
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:06,501
Yeah, it's a real low pressure pocket.

310
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,512
I appreciate your passion, Randa...

311
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:10,529
but as a field supervisor
of the controlling agency...

312
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,976
I say we abort. that's it,
we are gonna abort.

313
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:14,376
Wise call.

314
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:17,302
I'm sure the Landsat inspector
will be inspired by your courage.

315
00:21:17,503 --> 00:21:19,303
I hope you inspired by my common sense.

316
00:21:19,385 --> 00:21:20,789
This is only a map surveying

317
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,687
To one of the vast unchartered areas
on the face of the earth.

318
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:25,221
And you want to call it on account of rain?

319
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:26,727
Stay on the boat if you want to.

320
00:21:26,928 --> 00:21:29,618
It could be years
before we get another shot at this.

321
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,391
I'm told your unit is capable
of handling inclement weather, Colonel.

322
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,245
Why don't we leave it to Colonel Packard
to break the tie?

323
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:41,386
There is no way
I'm getting on that helicopter.

324
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:50,090
We did ask on those helicopters.
Should not they know why?

325
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,382
Why? And raise an alarm?

326
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:55,065
It is purely a precaution, Brooks.

327
00:21:57,139 --> 00:21:58,139
Right.

328
00:21:58,241 --> 00:21:59,908
Two mike to launch.

329
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:04,242
Two mike to launch.

330
00:22:13,768 --> 00:22:15,314
Still this end to come

331
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:18,642
Nothing he wouldn't do himself.
He is taking the lead.

332
00:22:18,843 --> 00:22:20,804
That means he miss his bed, I miss my bed.

333
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,006
Don't you miss your bed?

334
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:24,836
Do you even have a bed, Cole?

335
00:22:26,957 --> 00:22:28,673
You got a bed, right?

336
00:22:29,673 --> 00:22:31,313
See you at the rendevzous, Chapman.

337
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:32,805
Yes sir.

338
00:22:35,347 --> 00:22:36,347
<i>SEISMIC LOADS</i>

339
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,669
Complete FOB lockdown, and clear the deck.

340
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,970
One mike to launch.

341
00:22:53,513 --> 00:22:54,420
- Battery?
- Check.

342
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,468
- Generator start?
- Check.

343
00:22:56,568 --> 00:22:58,467
- Engine start?
- Checked three times.

344
00:23:00,528 --> 00:23:02,878
This is Fox. Leader of the Fox Group.

345
00:23:03,077 --> 00:23:04,580
It's time once again...

346
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:06,603
Griffin and ants show.

347
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,726
As usual, remember...

348
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:11,745
... Hold on to your butts!

349
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,574
Attention pilots. You are clear to takeoff.

350
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:19,530
Launch, launch, launch.

351
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:41,515
Combat formation.

352
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,121
Keep visual.

353
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,613
Fox five let me know when you're close.

354
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,277
Fox Five is in the slot.

355
00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:52,479
Roger that.

356
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:56,141
Fox Team, follow up on me. Keep together.

357
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,476
Let's do this!

358
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:13,713
Maintain course.

359
00:24:14,015 --> 00:24:15,655
Nothing we haven't done before.

360
00:24:16,865 --> 00:24:18,302
"Dear Billy.

361
00:24:18,881 --> 00:24:21,546
"You ever look inside a hurricane
and decide?

362
00:24:21,748 --> 00:24:24,000
"Maybe I should fly straight through it."

363
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,241
"Because that is what just happen."

364
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:31,967
You might want to hang on.

365
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:57,987
Fox Leader to Fox Group.

366
00:24:58,188 --> 00:24:59,587
Switch to inertial navigation.

367
00:25:01,322 --> 00:25:03,472
And remember the story of Icarus...

368
00:25:03,473 --> 00:25:06,516
whose father gave him wings, they flex.

369
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,162
Warned him not to fly too close to the sun.

370
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,208
But the exhilaration was too great.

371
00:25:12,408 --> 00:25:14,704
So he flew higher and higher...

372
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,858
until the sun melted his wings...

373
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,612
and he fell into the sea.

374
00:25:22,143 --> 00:25:25,811
The US Army is not an irresponsible father.

375
00:25:26,012 --> 00:25:29,845
So they gave us wings to fight hot **

376
00:25:30,046 --> 00:25:31,925
Pennsylvania steel.

377
00:25:32,855 --> 00:25:36,216
Guaranteed not to melt.

378
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:23,844
Oh wait, that's pretty, huh?

379
00:26:29,244 --> 00:26:30,794
Let's take him low and level.

380
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,849
Fox Leader to Fox Group.

381
00:27:15,146 --> 00:27:17,445
Clear up, survey as told.

382
00:27:18,545 --> 00:27:19,905
Fox Seven, prepare set her on deck.

383
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:23,449
Copy Fox Leader. Proceedl to Zone Six.

384
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:24,918
Put us down over there.

385
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:27,344
Everyone else, stay with the team leader.

386
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:33,303
Gears, get it, Come on,
Let's move it!

387
00:27:52,688 --> 00:27:53,720
<i>READY SYSTEM</i>

388
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,518
Ready for seismic **.

389
00:27:56,931 --> 00:27:57,931
Roger that.

390
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:02,215
Fox Group, let it fly.

391
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:13,694
Copy all. Fox Three.
Heading 0-9-0.

392
00:28:16,343 --> 00:28:17,701
Are you seeing what I seeing?

393
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,401
The seismic response is incredible.

394
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,710
Hey, Randy, you're not gonna believe this.

395
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:35,128
The bedrock,

396
00:28:35,928 --> 00:28:37,336
It's practically hollow.

397
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,246
Incoming!

398
00:29:03,146 --> 00:29:04,289
Look out!

399
00:29:50,985 --> 00:29:52,677
On guard, Fox Five!

400
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:54,903
Fox Eight is down! Four Fox is down!

401
00:29:55,104 --> 00:29:56,735
Respond, Fox Three!

402
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:05,179
Oh My God!

403
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,311
Does anyone know what that is?

404
00:30:09,512 --> 00:30:11,912
I don't know, man. God dammit...

405
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:14,143
Three km west of **

406
00:30:14,344 --> 00:30:15,746
Jesus! I never saw anything like it!

407
00:30:18,572 --> 00:30:20,264
Roger.

408
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:39,320
Is that a monkey?

409
00:30:39,472 --> 00:30:40,924
What the hell is that?

410
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:42,888
Somebody talk to me, man.

411
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:45,287
Turn right to 2-5-0.
Visual contact.

412
00:30:45,487 --> 00:30:46,838
Fox Leader to Fox Group.

413
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:49,629
Form a perimeter. Ready gunners position.

414
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,778
Shit!

415
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:57,378
Fox leader to Fox Group. Fire at will!

416
00:30:59,538 --> 00:31:01,266
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know!

417
00:31:18,891 --> 00:31:20,265
Pull out now. Pull out.

418
00:31:20,465 --> 00:31:21,585
I don't take orders from you!

419
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:22,774
Get us the hell out of here!

420
00:31:22,974 --> 00:31:23,974
Fox Nine is down!

421
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:30,441
Fox Six, we got  trouble.

422
00:31:31,247 --> 00:31:32,247
We are going down.

423
00:31:37,055 --> 00:31:40,096
Fox Five, this is Fox leader.
Fox Nine is down.

424
00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:42,015
1 klik north of the river bed.

425
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:43,478
Insert recovery team.

426
00:31:44,388 --> 00:31:46,117
Fox Five is hovering.

427
00:31:46,922 --> 00:31:48,313
We got men going out the door.

428
00:31:51,512 --> 00:31:52,828
I need help here. I need...

429
00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:54,147
Shit!

430
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:04,074
Kill this son of a bitch.

431
00:32:06,514 --> 00:32:07,514
Pull up!

432
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:16,944
Brace for impact!

433
00:32:22,778 --> 00:32:24,319
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday!

434
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:27,585
Yourself, you idiot!

435
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,599
Watch out!

436
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:44,493
Oh God!

437
00:32:46,794 --> 00:32:48,443
Prepare to crash!

438
00:32:48,643 --> 00:32:49,643
Brace!

439
00:32:58,543 --> 00:32:59,742
Fox Leader is down!

440
00:32:59,943 --> 00:33:01,642
Fox Five in bound to pick up!

441
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:03,142
We have him in sight.

442
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:06,208
Hold tight, Colonel Packard,
We're on our way!

443
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,160
Hang on, Briggs. I'm coming.

444
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:27,259
Going down.

445
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:29,458
I repeat, we are going down!

446
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:34,058
Listen, I want you to tell
me something right now.

447
00:33:34,257 --> 00:33:35,795
- Do you love your mama?
- I love her!

448
00:33:36,003 --> 00:33:38,323
- How much do you love your mama?
- I love her so much.

449
00:35:00,258 --> 00:35:02,657
Calling all units! Is anybody airborne?

450
00:35:02,856 --> 00:35:05,058
I repeat, is anybody airborne?

451
00:35:05,857 --> 00:35:08,806
They're all down. Everyone.

452
00:35:09,906 --> 00:35:11,635
We are on the south side of the island.

453
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:13,811
There is a river a couple
of klicks from here.

454
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,027
If we sticks to its bank,

455
00:35:15,057 --> 00:35:17,010
we make it to the EXFIL
site on the north shore.

456
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:20,213
And then what? All our choppers are down.

457
00:35:20,413 --> 00:35:21,933
We'll find a way to signal the ship.

458
00:35:22,017 --> 00:35:25,632
They'll send a search party.
We just have to make it by the exit window.

459
00:35:26,732 --> 00:35:28,545
I should be sitting at a desk.

460
00:35:28,744 --> 00:35:30,882
are we just not gonna talk about this?

461
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:33,888
My best guess is
we're scattered over 4 to 5 miles radius.

462
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:36,488
We must head north and join anyone we find.

463
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:37,804
Are you alright?

464
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:39,715
I don't know how to answer
that question right now.

465
00:35:39,915 --> 00:35:41,614
I don't know what that was either.

466
00:35:41,813 --> 00:35:44,729
All that money that they paid you?
I hope you're worth it.

467
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:47,471
You really not gonna talk about it?

468
00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:50,696
You know, this is not normal, right?
Stuff like that doesn't just happen!

469
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:54,595
This is Fox Leader to Fox group.

470
00:35:54,794 --> 00:35:58,281
Anybody with ears,
need respond.

471
00:35:58,481 --> 00:36:00,028
Flex, Chapman.

472
00:36:00,228 --> 00:36:01,437
Fox Six, Chapman.

473
00:36:01,637 --> 00:36:02,737
Say again your last.

474
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:05,165
4 klicks west, the highest peak in..

475
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:07,864
November Alpha 3-0-0.
Out.

476
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,965
Roger that, Chapman.
West highest mountain peak.

477
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:12,220
Oliver.

478
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,954
Fox Six confirmed, we're the Sea Stallion.

479
00:36:15,154 --> 00:36:17,353
Chapman, hold your position.

480
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:19,354
We will go to you. There is not

481
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:21,318
on that sea stallion to kill this thing.

482
00:36:21,518 --> 00:36:23,164
Survey your perimeter.

483
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:25,484
Locate possible ambush sites. Over.

484
00:36:27,507 --> 00:36:28,507
Chapman.

485
00:36:31,007 --> 00:36:32,007
Reles.

486
00:36:32,135 --> 00:36:34,433
Taking a non R day, you're good to go

487
00:36:34,634 --> 00:36:36,065
I'm good to go sir, sir.
506 Get him up.

488
00:36:39,766 --> 00:36:41,182
Chapman, all stations.

489
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:42,782
Recon the environment.

490
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,360
Cole, what's wrong with you?

491
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,359
How you even got an appetite right now?

492
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:06,958
Eating for living.

493
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:10,657
We just got taken down by a monkey
this size of a building!

494
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:11,857
Yeah!

495
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:15,775
That was an unconventional encounter.

496
00:37:15,976 --> 00:37:18,925
Is that all your brain
telling yourself right now?

497
00:37:19,525 --> 00:37:20,826
There was No tactical precedents.

498
00:37:21,025 --> 00:37:23,125
We did the best we could in the situation.

499
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,876
Griffin. Cole.!

500
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:35,646
Thank God you guys are okay!

501
00:37:38,946 --> 00:37:40,596
Good to see you, sir..

502
00:37:41,296 --> 00:37:42,596
How many left?

503
00:37:42,796 --> 00:37:44,401
Seven survivors.

504
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:46,500
Seven confirmed KIA.

505
00:37:49,453 --> 00:37:50,753
Slivko, and the rest are Unknown.

506
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:06,652
Where is Randa?

507
00:38:09,951 --> 00:38:10,951
How you doing?

508
00:38:11,018 --> 00:38:12,118
I'm fine. Thank you.

509
00:38:12,317 --> 00:38:13,317
Good.

510
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:15,287
Glad to hear it. I was worried about you.

511
00:38:20,026 --> 00:38:24,208
You are going to tell me
everything I do not know...

512
00:38:24,408 --> 00:38:26,418
or I'm gonna blow your head off.

513
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:30,709
Monsters exists.

514
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:31,949
No shit.

515
00:38:33,456 --> 00:38:34,481
Nobody believed me.

516
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:36,515
Yesterday, I was a crackpot.

517
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:38,698
But today.

518
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:42,168
So, This was never about geology.

519
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:44,859
You dropped those charges
to flush something out.

520
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:46,859
Who are you?

521
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:49,514
You heard of the USS Lawton?

522
00:38:49,715 --> 00:38:51,261
Neither did the public

523
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:55,440
Out of the thousand young men on the ship
I was the only survivor.

524
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,720
They told my family she
was sunk in battle...

525
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,000
but I know what I saw.

526
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,049
It had no conscience.

527
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:04,077
No reasoning, just destroy

528
00:39:04,278 --> 00:39:06,076
I spent the last 30 years...

529
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:09,276
trying to prove the truth of what
I learned that day.

530
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,821
This planet doesn't belong to us.

531
00:39:13,021 --> 00:39:17,320
ancient species owned this
earth long before mankind.

532
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,619
And if we keep our heads
buried in the sand...

533
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,119
they will take it back

534
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:23,319
My agency is known as Monarch.

535
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,119
We specialize in the hunt for
massive unidentified terrestrial organisms

536
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,319
You knew that thing was out here?

537
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:32,551
Sorry for your men, Colonel. I truly am.

538
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,539
Get us home with proof.

539
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,391
So we can send the cavalry.

540
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,218
I'm the cavalry.

541
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:55,927
It's called the Hollow Earth Theory.

542
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,728
Randa hired me...

543
00:39:57,926 --> 00:39:59,449
because I wrote paper...

544
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:02,747
Substantiating what most people think
is a crackpot idea.

545
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:06,429
That there is this massive
underground species

546
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:08,527
- Isolated from the surface world.
- Has it ways.

547
00:40:08,627 --> 00:40:11,446
Randa believed this island
may be one of those.

548
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:13,558
An emergence point for whatever lives below.

549
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,750
ancient species like what we just saw.

550
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,710
I thought he was out of his mind.

551
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,989
This is Slivko, do you read?

552
00:40:21,189 --> 00:40:22,189
Anybody out there?

553
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:24,182
We are headed north of the ex fil location

554
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,281
Everyone here seems way too calm right now.

555
00:40:27,262 --> 00:40:28,761
You copy?
Anybody?

556
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:30,141
We're out of range,
Slivko.

557
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:31,342
Shit.

558
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:33,303
Save it for when we get closer to the group.

559
00:40:44,902 --> 00:40:46,402
Nobody move.

560
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:50,203
Easy.

561
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,478
- Silvko.
- What?

562
00:41:13,177 --> 00:41:14,576
Put it down.

563
00:41:36,075 --> 00:41:39,076
These men did not die in vain.

564
00:41:40,276 --> 00:41:42,175
I swear to God...

565
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:46,375
Their deaths will not go unanswered.

566
00:41:50,835 --> 00:41:52,734
Now, Let's get to Chapman
and those munitions.

567
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:04,683
You ever heard of the story of the
mouse, lion and the Thorn?

568
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:06,490
Yeah.

569
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:07,889
There you go then.

570
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,091
In case we have see that primate again.

571
00:42:11,021 --> 00:42:14,001
You do know that the story is about a mouse
who turn a friend with a lion...

572
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,500
after taking out the thorn
out of his paw, right?

573
00:42:17,899 --> 00:42:19,320
No it's not.

574
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,730
The mouse kills the lion with the thorn.

575
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:24,788
Who told you that, Cole?

576
00:42:25,818 --> 00:42:27,218
My mother.

577
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,619
That actually explains a lot.

578
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:01,969
Watch out those tree!

579
00:43:02,169 --> 00:43:03,470
- Let's go come on!
- What is that?

580
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,670
Watch your six!

581
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:07,749
Up In the trees!

582
00:43:14,948 --> 00:43:15,948
Cole!

583
00:43:16,398 --> 00:43:17,398
No!

584
00:43:18,258 --> 00:43:19,258
We got you!

585
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:21,635
I can't get a shot!

586
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,337
Cut off the legs!

587
00:43:58,217 --> 00:43:59,317
I have you!

588
00:44:25,315 --> 00:44:28,313
Take it out, guys! Move out

589
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:34,318
Stay tight

590
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:42,618
What the hell is this?

591
00:45:29,614 --> 00:45:30,614
Go, Behind you!

592
00:45:31,314 --> 00:45:32,413
Stay Calm.

593
00:45:32,614 --> 00:45:33,614
Conrad.

594
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,112
Stay back!

595
00:45:35,757 --> 00:45:36,758
Guys.

596
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,238
Nobody shoot! Nobody shoot.

597
00:45:51,933 --> 00:45:53,583
No. No need for that.

598
00:45:53,783 --> 00:45:54,883
Come on now!

599
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:56,983
Everybody keep your wigs on now!

600
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:00,083
What?

601
00:46:00,603 --> 00:46:02,644
I did not believe it
when they said you would come.

602
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,045
I was up all night...

603
00:46:05,244 --> 00:46:08,149
Just thinking about how me and Gunpein
dreamt to this moment.

604
00:46:09,051 --> 00:46:10,350
And now Here it is.

605
00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:12,549
Twenty-eight years, 11 months...

606
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,261
8 failed attempts to get back to the world

607
00:46:15,462 --> 00:46:17,161
and instead, the world comes to me?

608
00:46:18,056 --> 00:46:19,155
Ain't that a fact?

609
00:46:21,255 --> 00:46:22,656
They Never smile.

610
00:46:23,356 --> 00:46:24,956
Did you Crash here?

611
00:46:25,955 --> 00:46:27,155
Sorry miss.

612
00:46:27,354 --> 00:46:30,101
Lt. Hank Marlow of the 45th.

613
00:46:35,537 --> 00:46:38,236
You are more beautiful..

614
00:46:38,436 --> 00:46:40,985
Than A hot dog and a beer...

615
00:46:41,185 --> 00:46:43,786
At Wrigley Field on opening day.

616
00:46:50,246 --> 00:46:52,055
But you are real.

617
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:55,395
Right?

618
00:46:57,795 --> 00:46:59,694
I told you. Did not I tell you?

619
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:01,101
I Said...

620
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,602
"It's fine".

621
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,801
There you go.

622
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,301
There's something out there, man.

623
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,999
There is a lot out there.

624
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:15,400
Now, Come on. We gotta get home.

625
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:18,199
You don't want to be out here at night.

626
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,656
You probably noticed a lot of weird things
on this Island

627
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:17,471
As long as we stay in here,
where the people live, we'll be alright.

628
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:20,057
That wall...

629
00:50:20,609 --> 00:50:22,845
Is that supposed to keep out that thing?

630
00:50:23,076 --> 00:50:25,925
No, he's not the one
we're trying to keep out.

631
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,524
What?

632
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,744
These people live up in
the top of the trees,

633
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:32,170
while we are down in the roots.

634
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:33,948
Some of them don't even seem to age.

635
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,540
No crime...

636
00:50:36,911 --> 00:50:38,588
No personal property.

637
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,427
They're past all that.

638
00:50:53,435 --> 00:50:55,599
Thank you.
Thank you.

639
00:50:57,274 --> 00:50:59,020
So Good news.

640
00:50:59,326 --> 00:51:01,145
They say you can shack up here.

641
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,769
I didn't hear them say anything.

642
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:07,025
They don't speak too much.

643
00:51:07,324 --> 00:51:11,261
been here as I long as I have,
you will start to understand, you'll see.

644
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,627
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

645
00:51:12,845 --> 00:51:15,284
We can not stay here.
We have to get off the island.

646
00:51:15,475 --> 00:51:16,899
We have lives.
I have a life.

647
00:51:17,195 --> 00:51:19,997
Nieves now is not the time. Alright?

648
00:51:20,232 --> 00:51:22,146
What lands here tends to stay here.

649
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:25,555
As far as I can tell...

650
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,611
this ship washed up about 10 years
before I did.

651
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,370
You've been here since '44?

652
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,300
Yeah

653
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,424
And What happened with the war? Do we win?

654
00:51:33,676 --> 00:51:34,676
Which one?

655
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,125
That Makes sense.

656
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,000
This is all halo ground to them.

657
00:51:40,046 --> 00:51:42,074
So if you like your hands,
don't touch anything.

658
00:51:58,069 --> 00:51:59,444
Look at that.

659
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:11,870
P s a g m e n o .com

660
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,184
The way they tell it,
for thousands of years...

661
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,810
the people of this island lived out of fear

662
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:23,115
It's hell of a long time to be scared.

663
00:52:26,925 --> 00:52:29,797
And then one day,
the damnest thing happened.

664
00:52:30,024 --> 00:52:31,904
Some of the things they were afraid of...

665
00:52:32,044 --> 00:52:35,131
Started protecting against the things
that were eating them.

666
00:52:37,346 --> 00:52:39,504
But nothing lasts forever, I guess.

667
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:49,166
And this is where they honor
the last of their saviors.

668
00:52:56,402 --> 00:52:57,403
Yeah.

669
00:52:58,675 --> 00:52:59,851
That's Kong.

670
00:53:03,944 --> 00:53:05,569
He is king down here.

671
00:53:08,347 --> 00:53:10,149
He is God to these people.

672
00:53:12,224 --> 00:53:14,105
Kong is a pretty good king.

673
00:53:14,764 --> 00:53:16,410
he's to himself mostly

674
00:53:19,644 --> 00:53:23,220
This is him home. We are just guests here.

675
00:53:24,959 --> 00:53:27,922
But you don't go into someone's house
and start dropping bombs...

676
00:53:28,324 --> 00:53:29,656
unless you're picking a fight.

677
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:32,806
Was it Kong the one who killed your friend?

678
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:35,625
No.

679
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,615
One of them did.

680
00:53:40,924 --> 00:53:42,949
Kong is God on the island...

681
00:53:43,123 --> 00:53:45,098
but the devils live below us.

682
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,809
And what are they called?

683
00:53:49,988 --> 00:53:51,422
The Iwis won't speak their name.

684
00:53:52,543 --> 00:53:54,769
But I call skull crawlers.

685
00:53:55,009 --> 00:53:56,205
Why?

686
00:53:56,715 --> 00:53:57,859
Cause it's sounds unique.

687
00:54:00,867 --> 00:54:01,867
Okay.

688
00:54:02,037 --> 00:54:04,326
I just made that name up.
I am trying to scare you.

689
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:05,699
I'm trying calling them that.

690
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:06,937
- Are you feeling it?
- Yes...

691
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,820
- I like the name...
- It's very good.

692
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,534
I never said the name out loud,

693
00:54:10,564 --> 00:54:12,573
Before It sounds stupid
now that I say just..

694
00:54:12,899 --> 00:54:14,276
You Call them whatever you want.

695
00:54:14,899 --> 00:54:17,217
Big lizard things. Nasty.

696
00:54:18,427 --> 00:54:20,143
They come from the vents.

697
00:54:20,408 --> 00:54:22,048
Deep down.
That's why Kong got so mad.

698
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:26,778
Cause bombs woke up a bunch of them.

699
00:54:30,344 --> 00:54:32,524
I tell you what, you're luckey.
He's out there too

700
00:54:32,844 --> 00:54:34,409
or you would not have made it this far.

701
00:54:35,553 --> 00:54:38,761
Like crappy basterds. Neat as hell.

702
00:54:43,175 --> 00:54:44,175
He can handle those...

703
00:54:50,324 --> 00:54:52,191
You don't want to wake up the big one.

704
00:54:52,495 --> 00:54:53,935
- How big is it?
- It's bigger than...

705
00:54:54,323 --> 00:54:55,979
The White daughter's whole family.

706
00:54:56,323 --> 00:54:58,776
Kong is the last of its kind
but he's still growing.

707
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:00,524
And you better hope he does.

708
00:55:00,722 --> 00:55:02,601
Because the Iwis say once Kong goes...

709
00:55:02,902 --> 00:55:04,943
Then the big one comes out.

710
00:55:06,628 --> 00:55:08,231
And it's good night Irene.

711
00:55:09,212 --> 00:55:10,831
Listen, There is a refueling team...

712
00:55:11,147 --> 00:55:13,676
coming to the north end of the island
in three days.

713
00:55:13,949 --> 00:55:15,250
You should come with us.

714
00:55:15,623 --> 00:55:17,110
At the north end of the island?

715
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:19,549
We're gonna get out of here.

716
00:55:19,709 --> 00:55:21,317
- In three days?
- Yes.

717
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,723
We can't get to the north end in three days.

718
00:55:29,968 --> 00:55:32,740
It is impossible. That's it. No way.

719
00:55:36,779 --> 00:55:38,248
At least not on our foot

720
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:04,684
That is one ugly ass bird.

721
00:56:21,353 --> 00:56:22,358
Dear Billy...

722
00:56:22,725 --> 00:56:24,358
this place is hell.

723
00:56:26,964 --> 00:56:28,433
The monsters exists.

724
00:56:28,724 --> 00:56:30,440
Under beds they sign to pay checks

725
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:32,889
- Come on, man.
- It seems like...

726
00:56:33,158 --> 00:56:35,522
Maybe he want's to go kill that ape
instead of get ourselves out of here?

727
00:56:35,723 --> 00:56:36,859
Yeah!

728
00:56:36,948 --> 00:56:38,008
Are we gonna make it?

729
00:56:38,058 --> 00:56:39,498
- Where?
- At the ex fil!

730
00:56:39,721 --> 00:56:41,258
We getta be there in three days!

731
00:56:41,543 --> 00:56:42,778
We'll make it, we're gonna make it.

732
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,700
Yeah, Cole but what happened to Chapman...?

733
00:56:44,904 --> 00:56:47,125
Colonel said he is there.
he's there.

734
00:56:53,524 --> 00:56:54,524
We were this close...

735
00:56:54,724 --> 00:56:55,754
to get it working.

736
00:56:55,778 --> 00:56:59,065
Gunpei and we're gonna take off
to the open sea trying to get home.

737
00:56:59,337 --> 00:57:01,060
And one of that things got him.

738
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:05,631
There she is.

739
00:57:16,784 --> 00:57:18,235
Well that's lovely.

740
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:22,442
Damn right.

741
00:57:31,123 --> 00:57:32,723
Is this thing even float?

742
00:57:33,348 --> 00:57:36,522
Me and Gunpei spent six years of our lives
to buliding this thing.

743
00:57:37,924 --> 00:57:39,714
It is called the Great Fox.

744
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,303
And she floats.

745
00:57:51,391 --> 00:57:53,008
I pulled the engine parts from my P-51...

746
00:57:53,378 --> 00:57:54,691
His old Zero.

747
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:57,235
On a B-29 on the beach
one day out or something.

748
00:57:57,618 --> 00:57:59,062
You gotta be kidding me.

749
00:57:59,255 --> 00:58:01,500
This machine is made out of pure tetanus.

750
00:58:03,177 --> 00:58:04,524
I know she isn't pretty to look at...

751
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,219
but it's nothing a couple
of extra hands can fix it.

752
00:58:07,523 --> 00:58:10,270
Unless you got a better idea,
I suggest we get craking

753
00:58:13,112 --> 00:58:14,112
Alright.

754
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:51,930
Come on, get up!

755
01:00:58,124 --> 01:00:59,948
Well, look at that.

756
01:01:01,428 --> 01:01:02,540
he Bleeds.

757
01:01:05,531 --> 01:01:06,996
We did that.

758
01:01:07,233 --> 01:01:08,768
We hook up with Chapman...

759
01:01:09,073 --> 01:01:11,578
There is enough munition
on that down Sea Stallion...

760
01:01:11,903 --> 01:01:13,477
to finish the job.

761
01:01:20,698 --> 01:01:21,895
Magnificent.

762
01:01:22,921 --> 01:01:25,235
You know why I carry
this instead of an M-16?

763
01:01:26,822 --> 01:01:29,402
I took it off a farmer
who fight for the NVA.

764
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,770
He surrendered right after
we levelled his village.

765
01:01:32,007 --> 01:01:33,424
He was 50 years old.

766
01:01:33,722 --> 01:01:35,442
Saying that he haven't see a gun
till we showed up.

767
01:01:35,626 --> 01:01:38,839
Sometimes, the enemy does not exist...

768
01:01:40,106 --> 01:01:41,783
until you are looking for one.

769
01:01:42,623 --> 01:01:45,121
What happens
when they show up on your door step?

770
01:01:45,475 --> 01:01:47,137
I still have his gun.

771
01:01:48,822 --> 01:01:51,322
Best of luck with that, soldier.

772
01:02:00,322 --> 01:02:03,067
Okay. So they have got 48 hours
to make it to the North Shore.

773
01:02:03,357 --> 01:02:04,795
Slivko, did you get to any back there?

774
01:02:05,172 --> 01:02:06,712
Yeah, pop's a mechanic.

775
01:02:06,941 --> 01:02:08,261
I can't fix this, he'll disown me.

776
01:02:09,422 --> 01:02:11,107
He never sees me again.

777
01:02:11,697 --> 01:02:13,073
Hold up on that, Churchill.

778
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:15,286
Russia was our ally.

779
01:02:15,557 --> 01:02:17,117
Now You say we're at war with them?

780
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,828
It is more of a cold war.

781
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:20,474
The Cold War like...

782
01:02:20,722 --> 01:02:22,258
That they take the summers off?

783
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:26,741
What about the Cubs?
The cubs owned a world series yet?

784
01:02:27,022 --> 01:02:28,022
The Cubs?

785
01:02:28,224 --> 01:02:29,304
No, not even close.

786
01:02:29,521 --> 01:02:30,561
Were they ever good?

787
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:32,106
That must be my team. Where are you from?

788
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:33,375
- Detroit.
- Okay.

789
01:02:33,892 --> 01:02:36,464
The tigers there.
They win all this year?

790
01:02:36,824 --> 01:02:38,527
- I do not know.
- I doubt it. Yeah.

791
01:02:40,476 --> 01:02:42,563
Hey, what do you think will win a fight?
A tiger or a Cub?

792
01:02:43,557 --> 01:02:44,785
A tiger will win.

793
01:02:45,822 --> 01:02:48,046
Yeah, because the puppies are babies.

794
01:02:48,345 --> 01:02:50,260
A full grown tiger can eat a baby.

795
01:02:52,142 --> 01:02:53,386
Think it through.

796
01:02:54,757 --> 01:02:56,893
We also put a man on the moon.

797
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,889
No kidding

798
01:02:59,222 --> 01:03:00,811
What did they do? Just leave him out there?

799
01:03:01,172 --> 01:03:02,551
What's he eating?

800
01:03:02,861 --> 01:03:04,860
Tang.

801
01:03:07,421 --> 01:03:09,079
Come on, we are loosing.

802
01:03:14,899 --> 01:03:17,288
Fox leader. this is Chapman, over.

803
01:03:18,422 --> 01:03:19,980
Fox leader. this is Chapman, over.

804
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:31,822
Dear Billy...

805
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:35,556
Sometimes life just punch you in the balls

806
01:03:36,341 --> 01:03:37,341
Dammit.

807
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,019
What kind of music is that?

808
01:04:30,026 --> 01:04:31,240
What happened to swing?

809
01:04:31,556 --> 01:04:32,573
Benny Goodman?

810
01:04:33,321 --> 01:04:34,608
You're like a time traveler man.

811
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,482
Telling you, this is the new sound.

812
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,817
<i>WRIGLEY FIELD HOME OF CHICAGO CUBS</i>

813
01:04:44,101 --> 01:04:46,377
I do not know if I'm gonna like
whoever is under this beard.

814
01:04:46,731 --> 01:04:50,019
I really hope that thing you call a boat
can get us upriver in 36 hours.

815
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:52,203
Because if we miss that window...

816
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,603
We are rather literally off the grid.

817
01:04:55,996 --> 01:04:58,402
When I first wrote that paper
on the Hollow Earth theory...

818
01:04:58,721 --> 01:05:00,636
All committee laughed out loud

819
01:05:01,756 --> 01:05:02,979
Not Randa.

820
01:05:03,571 --> 01:05:06,843
The one guy in the crowd
who actually took me seriously.

821
01:05:07,151 --> 01:05:08,561
It felt good.

822
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:11,097
Then I thought he was crazy
when he said these monsters.

823
01:05:12,444 --> 01:05:13,868
I can't tell when I am talking...

824
01:05:14,257 --> 01:05:15,737
- Or when I am not talking.
- You are talking.

825
01:05:16,076 --> 01:05:17,076
- Really?
- Yes.

826
01:05:17,166 --> 01:05:18,479
- I'm talking?
- Yes.

827
01:05:18,846 --> 01:05:19,993
Your mouth is moving

828
01:05:20,279 --> 01:05:21,279
What?

829
01:05:21,356 --> 01:05:23,451
I'm gonna stab you for the end of the night.

830
01:05:24,033 --> 01:05:25,041
Really?

831
01:05:26,121 --> 01:05:27,418
Just kidding.

832
01:05:31,621 --> 01:05:33,821
If the boat does not work,
we just take the train.

833
01:05:35,486 --> 01:05:39,854
Is not it odd, most dangerous places,
aurora is the most beautiful?

834
01:05:40,641 --> 01:05:43,451
I'm trying to take a
long exposure photograph

835
01:05:43,771 --> 01:05:45,091
but my flashlight broke

836
01:05:48,363 --> 01:05:49,363
Try this.

837
01:05:50,153 --> 01:05:51,153
Thank you.

838
01:05:53,956 --> 01:05:55,812
- Royal Air Force?
- My father's.

839
01:05:56,076 --> 01:05:59,406
He threw it to me from the train
as he rolled off to fight with the Nazis.

840
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:02,351
It was like John Wayne to me.

841
01:06:02,905 --> 01:06:04,488
Took our mythic hero.

842
01:06:05,941 --> 01:06:07,261
Did he come back?

843
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:10,048
His plane went down near Hamburg.

844
01:06:10,421 --> 01:06:12,287
They searched for him for months but...

845
01:06:16,402 --> 01:06:18,912
I suppose no man comes home from war.

846
01:06:20,431 --> 01:06:21,528
Not really.

847
01:06:30,866 --> 01:06:33,880
Mills, quit dickin' around.
I going off perimeter.

848
01:06:45,028 --> 01:06:46,118
Colonel Packard...

849
01:06:48,108 --> 01:06:52,032
this mission to the crash site

850
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:56,140
I understand going after your man.

851
01:06:57,241 --> 01:06:58,703
But the rest of it...

852
01:07:00,421 --> 01:07:01,899
This is beyond us

853
01:07:03,466 --> 01:07:05,547
You do not like the way I'm running things?

854
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:08,179
Then you know where the door is.

855
01:07:10,205 --> 01:07:13,405
You set this in motion
when you put this place on the map.

856
01:07:13,656 --> 01:07:16,428
And I will not cut and run.

857
01:07:19,245 --> 01:07:21,702
I know an enemy when I see it.

858
01:07:49,667 --> 01:07:52,108
This man's name was Gunpei Ikari.

859
01:07:55,245 --> 01:07:56,870
If you take away the uniforms...

860
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:58,695
and the war...

861
01:08:00,566 --> 01:08:02,214
Then he became my brother.

862
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:07,398
And we swore
we'd never leave each other behind

863
01:08:14,195 --> 01:08:15,665
Let's get off this island.

864
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,270
Not yet!

865
01:08:27,555 --> 01:08:29,183
- Behind the lines.
- Yes.

866
01:08:30,034 --> 01:08:31,120
Bind it up, Let's go!

867
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:33,522
Keep going!

868
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:40,218
Third time's the charm.
Here we go.

869
01:08:41,471 --> 01:08:43,284
let's go. let's go.

870
01:08:43,582 --> 01:08:45,117
Come on.

871
01:08:46,827 --> 01:08:47,827
Yes.

872
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,568
Yes!

873
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,639
I guess this is good bye.

874
01:09:22,795 --> 01:09:23,868
Thank you.

875
01:09:32,834 --> 01:09:35,320
If you're ever in Chicago,
look me up, I guess.

876
01:11:03,068 --> 01:11:04,365
Yeah, no. Let me, let me help.

877
01:11:06,445 --> 01:11:07,565
A man has gotta do what...

878
01:11:08,395 --> 01:11:09,395
Are you okay?

879
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:10,736
I'm Okay, I'm okay.

880
01:11:11,019 --> 01:11:12,059
Allow me.

881
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:14,683
You should see me in the library.

882
01:11:17,738 --> 01:11:19,275
I got a wife.

883
01:11:19,531 --> 01:11:20,560
Had a wife.

884
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,119
Have a wife?

885
01:11:23,449 --> 01:11:24,819
I guess I don't know.

886
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:28,340
Got hitched right before I deplyed.

887
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,185
Got a telegram from her the day
before I got shot down.

888
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:33,135
She said we just had our baby boy.

889
01:11:33,484 --> 01:11:34,484
I have a son out there.

890
01:11:35,419 --> 01:11:37,176
Grown man I've never met

891
01:11:37,468 --> 01:11:39,110
Yeah, she definitely thinks you're dead man.

892
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:40,495
Hey!

893
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:42,850
I'm just saying

894
01:11:43,484 --> 01:11:44,725
You don't know that.

895
01:11:45,099 --> 01:11:46,899
You'd be surprised how long people wait.

896
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,560
The truth is that
I do not expect him to be waiting.

897
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,008
That will be fine either way.

898
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:55,517
I just want one last chance to see them.

899
01:11:56,919 --> 01:11:58,382
That would be good enough for me.

900
01:11:59,464 --> 01:12:00,612
We are gonna get you home.

901
01:12:01,639 --> 01:12:02,862
Fox Five, come back.

902
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:04,098
Is there anyone out there?

903
01:12:04,344 --> 01:12:06,217
This is Fox Five. We hear you.

904
01:12:06,586 --> 01:12:08,619
Yeah! We're on a boat...

905
01:12:08,918 --> 01:12:10,807
- We're on a boat headed up north on river.
- A boat?

906
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,100
Where did you all get a boat?

907
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:14,719
We clean up, there is lika a crazy
Santa Clause, a time traveler.

908
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,220
Of World War II. You'll meet him.

909
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,400
What kind of boat?

910
01:12:17,819 --> 01:12:19,397
It is more like a plane a boat really.

911
01:12:19,646 --> 01:12:20,854
And it's called

912
01:12:22,259 --> 01:12:23,579
We need that location Slivko.

913
01:12:23,759 --> 01:12:25,518
Send up a flare so we could find you..

914
01:12:26,619 --> 01:12:28,019
Roger that, Fox Five.

915
01:12:28,605 --> 01:12:29,959
Fire in the hole!

916
01:12:35,259 --> 01:12:36,659
There!

917
01:12:36,949 --> 01:12:38,520
Yes!

918
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:41,008
I repeat, we have a visual.
2 clicks to our north.

919
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:43,554
Roger that, Fox Five. Fox One, out.

920
01:12:45,269 --> 01:12:47,025
rendezvous point, in one hour.

921
01:12:47,265 --> 01:12:48,265
Load up!

922
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,999
Can we fit everybody?

923
01:12:51,688 --> 01:12:52,794
Yes!

924
01:12:53,319 --> 01:12:54,319
We are going home!

925
01:13:01,299 --> 01:13:02,346
Man Down!

926
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:14,183
What the hell, man?

927
01:13:14,819 --> 01:13:15,928
He is gone.

928
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:19,219
Grab your gear. We have to keep moving.

929
01:13:20,419 --> 01:13:22,139
We are going shore
meet up with Packard

930
01:13:22,342 --> 01:13:23,620
No. Wait a minute!

931
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,936
Is nobody gonna say anything about the...?

932
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:27,194
He is gone!

933
01:13:27,408 --> 01:13:29,048
And he ain't coming back.
There is nothing to say.

934
01:13:32,949 --> 01:13:34,148
Oh my...

935
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,176
That flare was only 2 clicks north

936
01:13:42,559 --> 01:13:43,889
They should be here soon.

937
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:46,868
Unless the were eaten by something
that's bigger than us.

938
01:13:54,038 --> 01:13:55,038
Fuck!
Oh, shit.

939
01:13:55,239 --> 01:13:56,675
Slivko!

940
01:13:58,229 --> 01:13:59,549
I thought I'd not see you guys again.

941
01:13:59,619 --> 01:14:01,741
- I thought you were crazy.
- I wish I had been.

942
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:03,838
- What's the count?
- What you see...

943
01:14:04,119 --> 01:14:05,119
It is what we got.

944
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:06,275
We lost one too.

945
01:14:06,514 --> 01:14:07,514
Good to see you fellas!

946
01:14:08,339 --> 01:14:09,409
Who the hell is this?

947
01:14:09,707 --> 01:14:10,707
Heads up to hitchhiker.

948
01:14:11,338 --> 01:14:14,132
Lieutenant Hank Marlow
of the 45th suit sqaddron of the 15th.

949
01:14:14,467 --> 01:14:16,304
You've been here since world war 2?

950
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,711
Yes sir. I missed the parade?

951
01:14:19,474 --> 01:14:20,474
I'll be damned.

952
01:14:20,788 --> 01:14:22,219
Lieutenant.

953
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:23,691
We're gonna get him home, sir.

954
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:25,349
We follow this river...

955
01:14:25,584 --> 01:14:27,624
We'll make it to the boat,
we'll make it to the north shore in time.

956
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:29,221
That Sounds good.

957
01:14:29,539 --> 01:14:30,656
But we're not leaving yet.

958
01:14:30,905 --> 01:14:32,225
We still got a man out there, Conrad.

959
01:14:33,229 --> 01:14:34,583
Wait a second. You got someone out there?

960
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:35,865
Chapman.

961
01:14:35,876 --> 01:14:37,749
he is with the Down Sea Stallion,
Just west of it.

962
01:14:38,029 --> 01:14:39,799
West? We can't go west!

963
01:14:40,149 --> 01:14:41,632
That's where those skull things live.

964
01:14:41,938 --> 01:14:44,148
We have a old saying here.
"East is best, west is worst!".

965
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:45,481
That's why we say it!

966
01:14:45,778 --> 01:14:47,397
A little southwest...

967
01:14:47,758 --> 01:14:48,758
We could talk about that

968
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:51,209
But we are gonna need a lot more guns
if we're gonna go west.

969
01:14:51,918 --> 01:14:54,855
Guys. I think that we
should listen to Marlow.

970
01:14:55,753 --> 01:14:57,321
This is crazy.

971
01:14:58,497 --> 01:14:59,497
Hey.

972
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:02,990
Your job is find the lost men, right?

973
01:15:06,739 --> 01:15:07,739
Okay, sir.

974
01:15:07,964 --> 01:15:09,723
But if we reach that position,
and he is not there...

975
01:15:10,139 --> 01:15:11,219
We don't send out a search party.

976
01:15:11,394 --> 01:15:13,306
We're back here by nightfall, understood?

977
01:15:13,519 --> 01:15:15,553
In 24 hours, we got to be
on the other side of this island.

978
01:15:15,763 --> 01:15:18,173
Roger that. Hear you loud and clear.

979
01:15:18,466 --> 01:15:21,368
You heard the man.
We're moving out in 10.

980
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:22,971
It's a good group of boys.

981
01:15:23,356 --> 01:15:25,174
We are all gonna die together out here.

982
01:15:25,449 --> 01:15:28,355
Good group of boys to die with.
I'll tell you that..

983
01:15:29,317 --> 01:15:30,517
You should not have come to here.

984
01:15:31,518 --> 01:15:33,577
when do you get to tell me
this is a bad idea?

985
01:15:34,219 --> 01:15:35,634
This it a bad idea.

986
01:16:11,405 --> 01:16:12,578
Yeah, you smell that?

987
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:14,563
It's death.

988
01:16:18,019 --> 01:16:19,674
What the hell is this place?

989
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:22,271
This is what left of Kong's parents.

990
01:16:22,518 --> 01:16:25,718
I have taken enough photos of mass graves,
to recognize one

991
01:16:25,953 --> 01:16:28,223
The crash site is just only
other side of this valley

992
01:16:28,515 --> 01:16:30,975
We'll cross through and
make it to the highest point west.

993
01:16:33,192 --> 01:16:35,282
This place is a real no no, sir.

994
01:16:35,618 --> 01:16:37,098
We need to be going to the
north side right now.

995
01:16:37,253 --> 01:16:39,581
And you're welcome to do that, my man.

996
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:40,833
By your self.

997
01:16:42,003 --> 01:16:44,940
I'm not leaving Jack out there.
Now, Who's with me?

998
01:16:46,118 --> 01:16:47,118
We can make it.

999
01:16:47,316 --> 01:16:48,785
We can make it.

1000
01:16:49,118 --> 01:16:51,645
Now stay sharp keep an eye out.

1001
01:16:55,503 --> 01:16:57,704
I've only got here 28 years. What do I know?

1002
01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:31,717
Cole...

1003
01:17:31,793 --> 01:17:33,899
Won't got time for that man.
Put the cigarette out.

1004
01:17:47,218 --> 01:17:48,878
Watch those fumes!

1005
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,339
Idiots.

1006
01:17:54,818 --> 01:17:56,588
Let's go. We gotta move!

1007
01:18:05,363 --> 01:18:06,363
Run!

1008
01:18:10,658 --> 01:18:11,658
In Here!

1009
01:18:17,022 --> 01:18:18,057
Quite.

1010
01:18:38,976 --> 01:18:41,156
I told them to stand by
this was a no no.

1011
01:18:46,598 --> 01:18:47,610
Dammit.

1012
01:19:17,178 --> 01:19:18,178
Alright let's move.

1013
01:19:18,818 --> 01:19:19,963
Rather on me.

1014
01:19:24,837 --> 01:19:27,181
Somebody cover the civilians, quick
Let's Move!

1015
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:41,818
Oh shit.

1016
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:45,952
Randa!

1017
01:19:55,032 --> 01:19:56,032
Set up the 50!

1018
01:20:37,745 --> 01:20:40,497
Death before dishonor.
1045 Go!

1019
01:21:08,312 --> 01:21:10,351
Bring the torch! Do your thing!

1020
01:21:34,549 --> 01:21:35,792
Slivko!

1021
01:21:36,122 --> 01:21:36,944
Gas!

1022
01:21:37,072 --> 01:21:38,667
<i>TOXIC GAS</i>

1023
01:21:57,056 --> 01:21:58,837
Marlow!
The sword!

1024
01:22:24,437 --> 01:22:25,467
Slivko, Hang on!

1025
01:22:33,312 --> 01:22:34,403
This thing is moving!

1026
01:23:05,571 --> 01:23:06,736
Now look, Colonel.

1027
01:23:07,617 --> 01:23:09,537
You may out rank me...

1028
01:23:09,827 --> 01:23:12,327
but I've been here a hell a lot longer.

1029
01:23:12,617 --> 01:23:13,950
And I'm telling you...

1030
01:23:14,161 --> 01:23:17,417
that thing there just shredded us
was only the first of them

1031
01:23:17,682 --> 01:23:19,150
Now we are on their turf...

1032
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:22,026
... And we need to turn back!
Turn sweet.

1033
01:23:22,337 --> 01:23:24,069
Not as long as Chapman still out there.

1034
01:23:24,424 --> 01:23:26,086
I'm Sorry, Colonel Packard.

1035
01:23:27,269 --> 01:23:28,801
Chapman is dead.

1036
01:23:34,805 --> 01:23:35,956
Nothing changes then!

1037
01:23:36,223 --> 01:23:38,458
We're still going to that crash site.

1038
01:23:38,691 --> 01:23:40,366
What's that in the crash site
that you want so badly?

1039
01:23:40,556 --> 01:23:41,556
Weapons!

1040
01:23:41,591 --> 01:23:43,147
Enough to kill it.

1041
01:23:43,357 --> 01:23:44,580
Kong didn't kill Chapman.

1042
01:23:44,792 --> 01:23:46,267
But It did kill these men!

1043
01:23:46,966 --> 01:23:48,886
My men!

1044
01:23:49,071 --> 01:23:50,311
You can't kill Kong, Colonel.

1045
01:23:50,576 --> 01:23:51,942
Kong is God on this island.

1046
01:23:52,217 --> 01:23:54,640
It is the only thing
keeping that lizard things underground.

1047
01:23:54,916 --> 01:23:56,716
He's right, Colonel. We can't kill Kong.

1048
01:23:56,937 --> 01:23:58,292
And that other creature?

1049
01:23:58,551 --> 01:24:00,865
That's the threat.
And there are more of them down here.

1050
01:24:01,115 --> 01:24:03,348
If you take away
that species' natural competition

1051
01:24:03,558 --> 01:24:04,798
they will proliferate out of control.

1052
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:06,148
Then we will end them too!

1053
01:24:06,351 --> 01:24:08,321
After we bring this thing down.

1054
01:24:08,562 --> 01:24:09,815
I can not let you do that.

1055
01:24:10,114 --> 01:24:11,114
Wait! Hold your fire.

1056
01:24:14,751 --> 01:24:16,965
This is one war, we're not gonna loose.

1057
01:24:17,247 --> 01:24:18,247
It's nuts!

1058
01:24:18,467 --> 01:24:20,374
You hear me? This is nuts!

1059
01:24:20,671 --> 01:24:22,182
Please! You need to listen to him!

1060
01:24:22,465 --> 01:24:23,825
We are not at war, Colonel.
You are making a mistake.

1061
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:25,476
Your lies got my men killed!

1062
01:24:25,633 --> 01:24:27,593
- And you're gonna get us all killed.
- It's not our fight.

1063
01:24:28,667 --> 01:24:30,411
Whose side are you on, Captain?

1064
01:24:30,752 --> 01:24:32,071
Okay, Colonel.

1065
01:24:32,952 --> 01:24:34,978
You will find your Sea Stallion
3 click off that ridge

1066
01:24:36,396 --> 01:24:39,101
Now, I'm gonna take these civillians
back to the boat.

1067
01:24:39,415 --> 01:24:40,791
And we wait for you there.

1068
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:42,247
Alright?

1069
01:24:57,184 --> 01:24:58,184
Saddle up!

1070
01:24:58,944 --> 01:25:00,361
Let's go kill this thing!

1071
01:25:06,126 --> 01:25:07,227
Steve...

1072
01:25:07,616 --> 01:25:09,936
You running with the big dogs or
stayin' on the boat?

1073
01:25:10,917 --> 01:25:12,277
I don't wanna be on that.

1074
01:25:12,538 --> 01:25:13,716
Marlow, You okay?

1075
01:25:15,156 --> 01:25:16,656
We need to stop him.

1076
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:19,851
You want to talk off him about it agian?
He seemed really good for it first time.

1077
01:25:20,191 --> 01:25:21,416
He is losing his grip.

1078
01:25:23,109 --> 01:25:24,316
Follow me...

1079
01:25:25,166 --> 01:25:26,774
We'll be off this rock alive.

1080
01:25:31,591 --> 01:25:32,591
Dear Billy...

1081
01:25:34,416 --> 01:25:36,687
I'm trying to get home with you and Mom.

1082
01:25:37,751 --> 01:25:39,216
Be strong.

1083
01:25:40,501 --> 01:25:41,866
I love you.

1084
01:25:48,899 --> 01:25:51,119
Make sure those get back to his family.

1085
01:25:52,435 --> 01:25:53,592
Dear Billy...

1086
01:25:56,064 --> 01:25:58,481
Your dad was one of the best.

1087
01:26:06,366 --> 01:26:07,730
There is a water close by.

1088
01:26:08,306 --> 01:26:10,609
Are you lost? Which way?

1089
01:26:11,436 --> 01:26:12,535
Hang on.

1090
01:26:25,615 --> 01:26:26,644
Wait here.

1091
01:26:27,686 --> 01:26:29,714
Gonna get to high ground to find the river.

1092
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:33,955
Hey! I'm coming too.

1093
01:26:35,115 --> 01:26:36,334
I'll be right here.

1094
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:40,723
Keep your eyes open.

1095
01:26:41,831 --> 01:26:43,071
Up in the trees, too.

1096
01:26:44,015 --> 01:26:45,015
Why?

1097
01:26:45,159 --> 01:26:46,159
Ants.

1098
01:26:47,315 --> 01:26:48,357
Big ones.

1099
01:26:49,616 --> 01:26:50,616
There's one.

1100
01:26:52,261 --> 01:26:54,349
It sounds like a bird,
but it's a fucking ant.

1101
01:27:02,955 --> 01:27:06,070
Gather up everything you can,
including those seismic charges.

1102
01:27:07,114 --> 01:27:09,176
They got us attention the first time.

1103
01:27:23,481 --> 01:27:25,048
This is a bad idea.

1104
01:27:25,315 --> 01:27:26,502
Let's just get on with it

1105
01:27:27,166 --> 01:27:28,166
Mills, Cole...

1106
01:27:28,366 --> 01:27:29,452
Prep this ordnance.

1107
01:27:30,365 --> 01:27:32,343
Make him a special gift out of that Naplam.

1108
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,015
The boat must be around that bent.

1109
01:29:59,089 --> 01:30:00,649
We have to go,
Now.

1110
01:30:31,669 --> 01:30:32,914
Don't shoot!

1111
01:30:35,565 --> 01:30:37,135
Conrad, which way were you going?

1112
01:30:37,404 --> 01:30:39,452
You said you need to
get back to the boat.

1113
01:30:39,482 --> 01:30:40,164
It's that way.

1114
01:30:40,724 --> 01:30:42,114
Wait for us till dawn.

1115
01:30:42,345 --> 01:30:43,815
If you aren't back by then...

1116
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,585
Just go.

1117
01:30:47,255 --> 01:30:48,749
Where are you two going?

1118
01:30:50,644 --> 01:30:52,107
We gotta save Kong.

1119
01:30:53,235 --> 01:30:54,890
Not without me, man.

1120
01:32:35,314 --> 01:32:36,314
Oh God.

1121
01:33:00,514 --> 01:33:01,514
Men!

1122
01:33:01,789 --> 01:33:03,265
Place the chargers.

1123
01:33:04,313 --> 01:33:06,022
It's time to show Kong...

1124
01:33:06,264 --> 01:33:08,814
... That man is king!

1125
01:33:10,324 --> 01:33:11,324
On one.

1126
01:33:11,528 --> 01:33:12,528
On Two.

1127
01:33:13,214 --> 01:33:14,214
On three.

1128
01:33:17,024 --> 01:33:18,024
Packard!

1129
01:33:24,144 --> 01:33:25,192
Don't do it.

1130
01:33:29,634 --> 01:33:32,044
Asked you fellas nice the first time.

1131
01:33:32,349 --> 01:33:33,669
We don't want to fight here, Packard.

1132
01:33:33,869 --> 01:33:35,840
This this brought us down! He killed my men!

1133
01:33:36,114 --> 01:33:37,669
Kong was just defending its territory.

1134
01:33:37,969 --> 01:33:39,564
We are soldiers!

1135
01:33:39,949 --> 01:33:41,109
We do the dirty work!

1136
01:33:41,354 --> 01:33:44,314
So our families and our countrymen
don't have to be afraid!

1137
01:33:44,594 --> 01:33:47,184
They should not even know that
a thing like this exists!

1138
01:33:48,199 --> 01:33:49,623
You've lost your mind.

1139
01:33:52,189 --> 01:33:53,996
Put that detonator down.

1140
01:34:07,584 --> 01:34:08,584
Stop!

1141
01:34:12,599 --> 01:34:14,664
The world is bigger than this.

1142
01:34:15,414 --> 01:34:16,792
Bitch, please!

1143
01:34:17,089 --> 01:34:19,577
Slivko, get it out of there!

1144
01:34:21,683 --> 01:34:24,416
You know it's the wrong thing to do, son.

1145
01:34:41,314 --> 01:34:42,314
Put it down, sir.

1146
01:34:43,033 --> 01:34:44,283
Packard!

1147
01:34:57,883 --> 01:34:58,883
Come on.

1148
01:34:59,823 --> 01:35:00,823
It's over.

1149
01:35:17,048 --> 01:35:18,128
That's the big one.

1150
01:35:18,563 --> 01:35:19,563
Fall back.

1151
01:35:23,169 --> 01:35:24,169
Go!

1152
01:35:34,134 --> 01:35:35,184
Colonel.

1153
01:35:36,549 --> 01:35:37,549
Sir!

1154
01:35:59,054 --> 01:36:00,164
Die motherfucker...

1155
01:36:18,243 --> 01:36:19,594
- Kong.
- Kong's down. Let's go!

1156
01:36:25,573 --> 01:36:27,013
They told us to leave at dawn

1157
01:36:27,038 --> 01:36:28,038
- I know.
- It's dawn.

1158
01:36:28,221 --> 01:36:29,221
I know!

1159
01:36:29,438 --> 01:36:30,445
So what are we going to do?

1160
01:36:44,313 --> 01:36:45,675
This is the edge of the island.

1161
01:36:46,579 --> 01:36:49,713
Weaver, get up on those
rocks and fire a flare.

1162
01:36:50,038 --> 01:36:51,683
Well, then like, Brooks will see it.

1163
01:36:54,553 --> 01:36:55,892
I will buy you time.

1164
01:36:58,327 --> 01:36:59,501
This way.

1165
01:37:14,073 --> 01:37:16,422
Come on.
Every second counts.

1166
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:24,750
Cole!

1167
01:37:25,090 --> 01:37:26,658
Come on, man, we gotta fall back.

1168
01:37:27,613 --> 01:37:28,817
Go live your life.

1169
01:37:29,332 --> 01:37:30,612
Get out of here.

1170
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:34,460
- Cole, no!
- Cole!

1171
01:37:34,613 --> 01:37:35,630
Cole, no!

1172
01:37:35,863 --> 01:37:38,333
- Cole!
- Cole!

1173
01:37:38,813 --> 01:37:40,687
No, don't!

1174
01:37:41,311 --> 01:37:43,236
Cole!

1175
01:37:43,563 --> 01:37:44,563
Cole!

1176
01:37:50,813 --> 01:37:53,863
Come on. Come on.
You son of a bitch.

1177
01:38:19,778 --> 01:38:21,163
Come on! Run!

1178
01:40:08,632 --> 01:40:10,064
Come on!
Run!

1179
01:40:12,888 --> 01:40:14,343
Come on! Hurry!

1180
01:40:21,232 --> 01:40:22,232
Come on!

1181
01:40:29,611 --> 01:40:30,611
Marlow, will you help me?

1182
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,774
- Clear!
- Okay!

1183
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:27,538
Come on, Basterd!

1184
01:42:18,809 --> 01:42:19,809
Weaver!

1185
01:44:07,962 --> 01:44:09,718
Weaver?

1186
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:11,545
hey, hey hey!

1187
01:44:15,411 --> 01:44:16,437
You're okay?

1188
01:45:07,775 --> 01:45:09,550
So what do you think fellas?

1189
01:45:09,821 --> 01:45:11,369
This went to Key West?

1190
01:45:12,436 --> 01:45:13,811
I think it is, brother.

1191
01:45:15,413 --> 01:45:16,671
This place will change.

1192
01:45:17,951 --> 01:45:19,412
Word will get out.

1193
01:45:20,210 --> 01:45:21,210
It always does.

1194
01:45:22,110 --> 01:45:23,110
No, it's not coming from us.

1195
01:45:28,921 --> 01:45:32,551
We will meet again.

1196
01:45:33,711 --> 01:45:35,833
Don't know when.

1197
01:45:36,166 --> 01:45:39,050
Don't know when.

1198
01:45:39,310 --> 01:45:42,614
But I know we'll meet again.

1199
01:46:11,733 --> 01:46:17,137
