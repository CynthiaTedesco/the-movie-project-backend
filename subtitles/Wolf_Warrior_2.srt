attention, pirates alongside!

3
00:02:56,742 --> 00:03:00,742
Pirates alongside!
Take cover. All crew below deck!

4
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:03,666
I repeat pirates alongside!

5
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,690
Initiate emergency procedure!

6
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:09,714
All crew below deck!

7
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:53,738
Emergency positions!
Code red! Code red!

8
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:56,662
Get everybody below deck, now!

9
00:03:58,686 --> 00:04:00,686
Everyone, get down!

10
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,710
Jack, where's that un convoy?

11
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:07,734
The chopper's on its way, sir.
Eta 30 minutes!

12
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:09,758
Get everybody below deck

<font face="viner hand itc" color="#8080c0">wolf warrior ii</font>

14
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:59,706
I'm waiting for my son

15
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,730
I need our home for his return!

16
00:07:04,654 --> 00:07:07,654
Wait till police get here! Let's see
how you're going to tear our houses!

17
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,678
If they wanna die, then let 'em.

18
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:26,702
Mrs. yu, mrs.Fei.

19
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:29,726
We brought xiao fei home

20
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,650
salute!

21
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:51,674
Tell these rookies what our motto is

22
00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:53,698
be humble

23
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:55,722
I became a soldier because
I wanted to be in battles

24
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:57,746
and now, what about the battles?

25
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,810
Much better to be at home with
wife and kids instead

26
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:06,694
my daughter,
she's beautiful, huh?

27
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,718
You gang of sumbags!

28
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:34,742
You think you're tough, huh?

29
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,666
Go get them! Get them!

30
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,690
Officer see! He's got a gun!

31
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:06,714
A gun!

32
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:09,738
Comrade, put down your weapon!

33
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:22,662
You're pretty lethal, huh?

34
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:24,686
Well you'd better kill me now,

35
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,710
because you're gone,

36
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,734
I'm gonna make them wish they
were dead

37
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,658
hey!

38
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,682
Leng feng!

39
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:31,706
The reason a soldier is respected

40
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,730
is not because of the uniform he wears,

41
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:38,654
but is because of the sense of
duty he carries

42
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:42,678
with or without the uniform,
the duty remains

43
00:10:42,702 --> 00:10:44,702
and he continues to be respected

44
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,726
three years later

45
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,650
<font color="#ffff00">shenmutusawa bay, Africa</font>

46
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:14,674
hey, hurry up!

47
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:19,698
Hey, leng. There's our hero

48
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,722
thanks for saving the lives of
everyone

49
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:23,746
let's take a picture together.
No problem!

50
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,070
- Thank you!
- Ok, see you!

51
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:29,071
Take care, see you!

52
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:35,695
Hey, boss!

53
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:38,719
Buy some, it's good stuff.
There was an outbreak in taman recently

54
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:41,743
because of consuming this herbs,
there were 4 survivors

55
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,767

- No, thank you!

56
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,791
Please help please consider

57
00:11:45,815 --> 00:11:47,815

58
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:51,739
Chinese wine.

59
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:54,663

60
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:56,687
- hey, hey.

61
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:58,711
ok, this one is okay

62
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:02,735
nice one. See you next time.

63
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,659
Get up here!

64
00:12:09,683 --> 00:12:11,683
Welcome back!

65
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:21,707
Bye

66
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:24,731
this, good for you

67
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:27,655
you're not alone

68
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,679
20 dollars. Buy one get one free

69
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:35,703
- who am I?
- My godfather

70
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:38,727
if your godfather tells
your mother about this,

71
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:41,651
what would she think?
Confiscated!

72
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:52,699
Begin!

73
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:58,723
Godfather! Godfather! Godfather!

74
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:07,747
Harry! Harry! Harry!

75
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:09,771
Godfather! Godfather! Godfather!

76
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:27,695
Leng! Leng! Leng!

77
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:37,719
Who?

78
00:13:40,743 --> 00:13:42,743
Who?

79
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,667
Who else? Who else?

80
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:48,691
Do it, do it

81
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:51,715
fuck it!

82
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:53,739
Who the fuck you think you are?

83
00:13:53,763 --> 00:13:55,763
Come on!

84
00:13:55,787 --> 00:13:57,787
Yeah

85
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,711
Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!

86
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:54,735
I've been sent to the border
for a mission

87
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,659
when I get back,

88
00:14:57,683 --> 00:15:00,683
this had better be signed

89
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:14,207
marriage application

90
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:17,231
why did you join the army?

91
00:15:17,255 --> 00:15:20,575
Join the army, you regret it for two years.
Don't join the army, regret it for life.

92
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:23,179
- The truth?
- That's the truth.

93
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:26,203
Drink! Again!

94
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:34,151
Comrade long xiao yun.

95
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:36,295
Was attacked while carrying her
mission at the border.

96
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,199
We found this bullet.

97
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:45,223
Drink again.

98
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:54,247
What do you want to hear?

99
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:56,171
What do you want to hear?

100
00:15:56,195 --> 00:15:58,195
Drink!

101
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,219
Again!

102
00:16:30,243 --> 00:16:32,143
You win.

103
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,167
You win.

104
00:16:35,191 --> 00:16:37,191
But I lost...

105
00:16:37,215 --> 00:16:39,215
I've lost completely.

106
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:42,239
It's been more than a year
since you came on board

107
00:16:42,263 --> 00:16:46,163
during that time, from djerba to tolanaro,

108
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:50,187
I've asked all the chiefs.
More than half of Africa,

109
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:54,211
and nobody has seen that bullet before.
Peluru itu sebelumnya.

110
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:57,235
<i>I will find it,</i>

111
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:59,259
<i>even if I have to scour
the entire continent.</i>

112
00:17:18,183 --> 00:17:20,183
Dear fellow countrymen,

113
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:25,207
my deepest condolences to the families their
loved ones during batchka village incident

114
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:29,231
early today, the red scarf rebel army claimed
responsibility for the batchka village

115
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:31,255
our government condemns
their barbaric behavior.

116
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,179
Our homeland has been attacked on
multiple occasions.

117
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:37,203
These are great tragedies.

118
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:45,227
The rebels continue to advance as the
country grapples with the lamanla outbreak.

119
00:17:45,251 --> 00:17:49,151
As your government, we will not back down. The
great people's army will fight to the very end.

120
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:53,175
Quarantine have been set up
across the country,

121
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:55,199
in an attempt to contain
the lamanla outbreak.

122
00:17:55,223 --> 00:18:02,223
We have declared a state of emergency.

123
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:12,247
Hey, brother

124
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:14,271
you shorted me 300 bucks.

125
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,195
Be careful with that.

126
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:21,219
Look, we're both Chinese.

127
00:18:21,243 --> 00:18:23,243
You do this to your own people?

128
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:26,167
Since 3 pm on the 14th of last month,

129
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:28,191
I am no longer officailly Chinese.

130
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:32,215
What? Fresh off the boat?

131
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:39,239
Hear that? In times like this,

132
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:41,263
that's the price you get.

133
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:48,187
Seen this before?

134
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:53,211
Nope

135
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,235
I've been told that it came
from these parts.

136
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:01,159
Definitely never seen it.

137
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,183
Hey boss.

138
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:06,207
How are you? Smoking?

139
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:40,231
Tundu!

140
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:53,155
Go! Go!

141
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:01,179
Don't shoot!

142
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:03,203
Don't shoot!

143
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:04,327
- Don't shoot!
- Good people

144
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:06,351
go, go, go!

145
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,375
Get the fuck down or you die!

146
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,199
Hail the revolution!
You're now talking to rebels!

147
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:20,223
Don't lie to me.
Your luck is down!

148
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:22,247
Hail the revolution!

149
00:21:25,171 --> 00:21:26,571
No, no, no guys, look!

150
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:28,595
Revolution!

151
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:32,219
What the fuck is this?!
No, no, no

152
00:21:32,243 --> 00:21:34,243
he's a pro-government rat!

153
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:36,167
- No!
- You lied to me!

154
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:38,191
No!
Hail the rebels! Hail the rebels!

155
00:22:25,215 --> 00:22:27,215
Shit!

156
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:36,239
Tundu!

157
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:49,163
Chinese embassy.
Let's go to the Chinese embassy.

158
00:22:49,187 --> 00:22:51,187
They'll take us in.
We're Chinese.

159
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:55,211
What about us?
What're we suppose to do?

160
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:57,235
Will they accept us?
Hard to say.

161
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:00,159
That's our country.
Everybody follow me.

162
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,183
Go!

163
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:10,207
Go!

164
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:24,231
Go!

165
00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:33,155
Go!

166
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,679
Come on!

167
00:23:53,203 --> 00:23:55,203
No!

168

00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:32,151
slow down! No, no! We're Chinese

170
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,175

171
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:36,199
Go, go, go!

172
00:26:37,223 --> 00:26:39,223
Die! Scum! Hail the revolution!

173
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:41,247
Die! Scum!

174
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:45,171
Die! Scum!

175
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:51,195
- Die!
- Lower your guns!

176
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:53,219
Put down your weapons!

177
00:26:55,243 --> 00:26:57,243
Lower your guns!
Lower your guns!

178
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:03,167
Stand down!

179
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:05,191
We are Chinese!

180
00:27:05,215 --> 00:27:07,215
We are Chinese!

181
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:10,239
China and Africa are friends!

182
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:21,163
Go.

183
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:24,187
Go, hurry. Go.

184
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:26,211
Go.

185
00:27:28,235 --> 00:27:30,235
Fall back!

186
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:37,159
Help! Help!

187
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:51,683
South Indian ociean. Redeployment of China Navy fleet to Africa

commander, all foreign vessels
are leaving the war zone.

189
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:08,731
The harbor is unsafe.
Are you certain about docking?

190
00:29:11,655 --> 00:29:13,655
Forward 10 knots.

Set course bearing for 270.

192
00:29:28,703 --> 00:29:30,703
Open the gate!

193
00:29:48,727 --> 00:29:51,727
Well done, you got here just in time

194
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:54,651
what's the situation?
The entire country's in chaos.

195
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:57,675
The war has destroyed lives of
many of countrymen.

196
00:29:57,699 --> 00:30:00,699
Can you send our troops
in to help?

197
00:30:00,723 --> 00:30:02,723
Without the un's authorization,

198
00:30:02,747 --> 00:30:04,747
our troops aren't premitted
to enter the war zone.

199
00:30:08,671 --> 00:30:13,671
Ok, slow down up we go! Nice!

200
00:30:14,695 --> 00:30:16,695
Where are from? He can't board.

201
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:18,719
He's my son.

202
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:20,743
We have tickets. See, look!

203
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:22,767
Three tickets. 79, 80, 81.

204
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:26,691
Fine then. 79, 80, 81.

205
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:28,715
Thank you.

206
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:31,739
Where are we going?

207
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:34,663
Mr. prime minister, please listen to me.

208
00:30:34,687 --> 00:30:37,687
I'm deeply sorry for what's happening
in your country.

209
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,660
But I believe you have not forgotten
about the help,

210
00:30:41,684 --> 00:30:43,684
we provided to your country

211
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,708
<i>and friendship between our countries</i>

212
00:30:46,732 --> 00:30:48,732
<i>I believe you understand how important</i>

213
00:30:48,756 --> 00:30:51,656
<i>our citizen Dr. chen
is to Africa.</i>

214
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,180
Please send somebody to protect
his safety.

215
00:30:54,204 --> 00:30:56,204
I'm sorry,

216
00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:59,128
you're on your own this time.
<i>Prime minister</i>

217
00:30:59,152 --> 00:31:01,152
where's Dr. chen?

218
00:31:03,176 --> 00:31:05,176
I will never

219
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
tell you

220
00:31:07,224 --> 00:31:09,224
dyon military resourcing corporation
, roach

221
00:31:13,224 --> 00:31:15,224
let's go!

222
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,248
12 years of hard work.

223
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:23,172
One war,
and it's all fucking gone

224
00:31:25,196 --> 00:31:27,196
the bullet...

225
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,220
What's the story?

226
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:43,244
Tundu!

227
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,168
Tundu!
If you get off, you can't get back on.

228
00:31:47,192 --> 00:31:49,192
Tundu! Tundu!

229
00:31:49,216 --> 00:31:50,616
Stop right there!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

230
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,217
I want my mom!

231
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:54,241
I want my mom, I don't want to go to China!

232
00:31:54,765 --> 00:31:56,665
Look at me - I want my mom!

233
00:31:56,689 --> 00:31:58,689
I want my mom!

234
00:31:59,713 --> 00:32:01,713
- Ok? I want my mom!
- Hey brother

235
00:32:04,737 --> 00:32:06,737
what are you doing down here?

236
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:09,661
There's something I have to tell you.

237
00:32:09,685 --> 00:32:11,685
That bullet...

238
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:15,709
I've seen it before.
That pattern,

239
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,733
is a symbol used by the rebel forces.

240
00:32:19,657 --> 00:32:21,657
An arm dealer friend of mine told me

241
00:32:21,681 --> 00:32:24,681
the rebels have hired the most expensive
mercenaries out of Europe.

242
00:32:25,705 --> 00:32:27,705
Whatever grudge you've got against them,

243
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:29,729
I urge you,

244
00:32:29,753 --> 00:32:31,753
don't go seeking death.
47 Chinese workers!

245
00:32:31,777 --> 00:32:33,777
Are still stuck at
the hanbond Chinese factory

246
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:36,701
what's worse, dr, chen is stuck 55 km

247
00:32:36,725 --> 00:32:38,125
behind enemy lines
on a medical relief mission

248
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:40,726
he's a high value target
for the rebel army.

249
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,110
Everything is in total lockdown
from lochino to St. Francis.

250
00:32:43,674 --> 00:32:45,674
Without un's authorization,

251
00:32:45,698 --> 00:32:47,698
my troops aren't allowed to
enter the war zone.

252
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:49,722
This operation is highly important!

253
00:32:49,746 --> 00:32:51,746
We have to evacuate those Chinese workers!

254
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,670
And Dr. chen by all means!

255
00:32:53,694 --> 00:32:56,694
Under current circumstances, combat troops
are prohibited from entering the warzone!

256
00:32:56,718 --> 00:32:58,718
In order to complete the evacuation,

257
00:32:58,742 --> 00:33:00,742
someone has to undertake
the mission alone!

258
00:33:00,766 --> 00:33:02,766
- I'll go.
- Stop right there!

259
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,790
What's your purpose?

260
00:33:05,714 --> 00:33:08,714
Former pla, South-east region,

261
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:10,738
specail ops brigade,
wolf warrior squadron,

262
00:33:11,662 --> 00:33:13,662
leng feng.

263
00:33:13,686 --> 00:33:15,686
This child's mother is
at hanbond Chinese factory.

264
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,710
I know approximately where it is located.

265
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:25,734
I promise you,

266
00:33:25,758 --> 00:33:28,658
I will bring your mom back.

267
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:36,682
We took care of business now, didn't we?

268
00:33:36,706 --> 00:33:38,706
Ambassador Thomas, king Angola,
prince drew.

269
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,730
That goddamn communications manager.

270
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,654
They're all gone.
They all disappeared,

271
00:33:44,678 --> 00:33:46,678
real mysterously!

272
00:33:46,702 --> 00:33:49,702
<i>Stop wasting my time with
that crap!</i>

273
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:51,726
<i>Where's Dr. chen?</i>

274
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,650
Ah, Jesus.

275
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,674
You tell him what you told me.

276
00:34:12,698 --> 00:34:14,698
Dr. chen

277
00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:18,722
is at St. Francis Chinese-invested
hospital.

278
00:34:18,746 --> 00:34:20,746
Good boy.

279
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,670
Did you hear that?

280
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,694
That could be sound of the future.

281
00:34:40,718 --> 00:34:44,718
Sir, why are we helping
these fucking idiots?

282
00:34:44,742 --> 00:34:46,742
Welcome to Africa, son.

283
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:49,666
Alrights, let's move out boys!

284
00:35:08,714 --> 00:35:10,714
From the latest report,

285
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:12,738
the fighting is reaching
semshalemu harbour.

286
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:16,662
The urgency of the evacuating
1536 Chinese nationals wating there

287
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:18,686
has just been escalated.

288
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,710
Our vessels are heading over
at top speed.

289
00:35:20,734 --> 00:35:23,734
My apologies,
because the conflict is on foreign soil,

290
00:35:23,758 --> 00:35:25,758
you'll have no reinforcements,

291
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:27,782
no allies and no weapons.

292
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:30,706
Dr. chen and 47 Chinese workers,

293
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,730
evacuate them all.

294
00:35:32,754 --> 00:35:36,654
Sunkoojia

297
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,726
my boss asked me

298
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,750
to find Dr. chen.

299
00:36:11,774 --> 00:36:14,674
Nobody wants to do something!

300
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:17,698
Now, I have to try my luck.

301
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:19,722
Because

302
00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:21,746
I have

303
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,770
a special vision.

304
00:36:24,694 --> 00:36:26,694
Let me guess...

305
00:36:33,718 --> 00:36:36,518
Saint Francis China-hospital

306
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,742
are you Dr. chen?

307
00:36:53,766 --> 00:36:56,666
I'm not! I'm not!
Are you Dr. chen?

308
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,690
- Are you Dr. chen?
- No, no, no.

309
00:36:59,714 --> 00:37:01,714
She's a child, just a child

310
00:37:01,738 --> 00:37:03,738
I am - no

311
00:37:06,662 --> 00:37:08,662
no

312
00:37:11,686 --> 00:37:13,686
I'm Dr. chen.

313
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,710
You are Dr. chen?

314
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:25,734
Looks like Dr. chen doesn't have balls.

315
00:37:26,658 --> 00:37:28,658
What do you want?

316
00:37:28,682 --> 00:37:30,682
- I am Dr. chen.
- Dr. Rachel, no!

317
00:37:32,706 --> 00:37:34,706
She's not Dr. chen.

318
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,730
She's a very good doctor.

319
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,754
She saved so many lives.

320
00:37:39,678 --> 00:37:41,678
No!

321
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:51,702
Dr. chen!

322
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:53,726
Papa!

323
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,650
You just killed.

324
00:37:57,674 --> 00:37:58,674
Dr. chen.

325
00:38:00,722 --> 00:38:02,722
- Papa!
- Dr. chen!

326
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:42,746
Dr. chen, right?

327
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,770
I was sent by ambassador
fan to rescue you.

328
00:39:47,694 --> 00:39:49,694
This is my daughter, pasha.

329
00:39:49,718 --> 00:39:51,718
Please, I beg you, protect her.

330
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,742
Dr. chen!

331
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,666
Come with me!

332
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,690
Get in the car!

333
00:40:29,714 --> 00:40:31,714
Go fast!

334
00:40:37,738 --> 00:40:39,738
What are you doing?

335
00:40:39,762 --> 00:40:42,662
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm saving your ass!

336
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:56,686
Let me drive!

337
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,710
Move!

338
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:53,734
What the hell!

339
00:41:54,658 --> 00:41:56,658
Turn around!

340
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,682
Go, go, go!

341
00:42:30,706 --> 00:42:32,706
Jesus.

342
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,730
Pasha!

343
00:44:29,654 --> 00:44:31,654
Are you okay?

344
00:44:31,678 --> 00:44:33,678
Are you okay?

345
00:44:33,702 --> 00:44:35,702
Are you okay?

346
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:47,726
Are you okay?

347
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,650
Are you okay?

348
00:44:52,674 --> 00:44:54,674
Yeah.

349
00:44:54,698 --> 00:44:59,698
Pasha.

350
00:45:04,722 --> 00:45:06,722
Stop!

351
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,746
Stop!

352
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,670
You want food? We have food.

353
00:45:23,694 --> 00:45:25,694
We have food, okay?

354
00:45:25,718 --> 00:45:27,718
We have food.

355
00:45:57,742 --> 00:45:59,742
Are you okay?

356
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:19,666
Thank you.

357
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,690
Is that from quarantine zone?

358
00:46:27,714 --> 00:46:29,614
Pasha, can you please hand me the bag?

359
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:31,871
I said, did you get that in
the quarantine zone?

360
00:46:35,695 --> 00:46:37,695
It's nothing.
I'm not overreacting.

361
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:40,719
In fact, it's better if I was.

362
00:46:40,743 --> 00:46:43,743
Those people back there were
infected with the lamanla virus.

363
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,767
Symptoms include the sudden onset fever,

364
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:47,691
hallucinations, lesions,

365
00:46:47,715 --> 00:46:52,715
cold sweats. It's a fatal virus that's
transmitted through direct human contact.

366
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:55,739
Upon contraction, death strikes between
four hours and five months.

367
00:46:55,763 --> 00:46:59,663
Up until now,
no cure has been found.

368
00:46:59,687 --> 00:47:01,987
Don't worry, I'm insured.

369
00:47:21,711 --> 00:47:23,711
You're killing the Chinese?

370
00:47:24,735 --> 00:47:26,735
This is a big trouble.

371
00:47:26,759 --> 00:47:28,759
Why are you killing the Chinese?

372
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:34,683
Sir...
I thought you wanted Dr. chen.

373
00:47:36,707 --> 00:47:39,707
Congratulations. You found him.

374
00:47:42,755 --> 00:47:44,755
Fuck!

375
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,779
I wanted him alive!

376
00:47:46,803 --> 00:47:47,803
Alive!

377
00:47:47,827 --> 00:47:51,727
Don't you understand how important
it is to me?

378
00:47:55,651 --> 00:47:57,651
Fuck!

379
00:47:59,675 --> 00:48:01,675
Wait.

380
00:48:01,699 --> 00:48:03,699
That girl.

381
00:48:04,723 --> 00:48:06,723
I like her.

382
00:48:06,747 --> 00:48:11,747
Sir, our facial recognition crew uploaded video
of this man fighting off some of the pirates.

383
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:13,671
His name's leng.

384
00:48:13,695 --> 00:48:16,695
Ex-member of a secretive special ops
unit pot of China.

385
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:18,719
Wolf warrior.

386
00:48:18,743 --> 00:48:20,743
Boys!

387
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:32,667
The doctors without borders
were killed by armed mercenaries.

388
00:48:32,691 --> 00:48:35,691
The lives of Dr. Cheng and other
Chinese medical staff were scarificed.

389
00:48:35,715 --> 00:48:37,715
<i>Comrade leng,</i>

390
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:39,739
do you stand by what
are you're saying?

391
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:42,663
Are you certain you witnessed the massacre
or our medical team?

392
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:44,687
I'm cetain.

393
00:48:44,711 --> 00:48:47,711
Dr. chen give me his daughter
before he died.

394
00:48:47,735 --> 00:48:49,735
An African girl.

395
00:48:49,759 --> 00:48:51,759
Her name is pasha.
Oh, and anurse too.

396
00:48:51,783 --> 00:48:53,683
What's your name?

397
00:48:53,707 --> 00:48:55,707
Rachel Prescott Smith.
You can call me Rachel.

398
00:48:56,731 --> 00:48:58,731
Doctor Rachel, I'm not a nurse.

399
00:48:59,655 --> 00:49:01,655
Report the situation to ambassador
fan immediately.

400
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:03,679
Yes sir.

401
00:49:03,703 --> 00:49:05,703
Commander, may I speak to
my son please?

402
00:49:06,727 --> 00:49:09,727
<i>Godfather, godfather! Where's my mom?
Where's my mom?</i>

403
00:49:09,751 --> 00:49:11,751
<i>Hey, tundu, tundu!
Trust me, trust your godfather.</i>

404
00:49:12,675 --> 00:49:14,675
We are going to hanbond Chinese factoty

405
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:16,699
to find your mom right now, okay?

406
00:49:17,723 --> 00:49:19,723
Thank you, godfather.

407
00:49:19,747 --> 00:49:21,747
Leng, I have some bad news for you.

408
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:24,671
<i>The rebel army is sobotaging
all major roads,</i>

409
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,695
<i>railways and Bridges.</i>

410
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:28,719
<i>As of 10 minutes ago,</i>

411
00:49:28,743 --> 00:49:30,743
<i>your only route to the port,
the bowerneja bridge,</i>

412
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:34,667
<i>was bombed. We are formulating an
escape plan now.</i>

413
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:37,691
<i>But untill then, you're on your own.</i>

414
00:49:37,715 --> 00:49:41,715
Set your watch.
The macimum time we can wait is 18 hours.

415
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:43,739
After that, we'll be forced to leave.

416
00:49:43,763 --> 00:49:45,663
My deepest apologies.

417
00:49:45,687 --> 00:49:47,687
I have the responsibility
to everyone on board.

418
00:49:47,711 --> 00:49:49,711
I understand.

419
00:49:53,735 --> 00:49:55,735
You're going to the Chinese factory?

420
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:57,759
We should go to the
ameriacn consulate.

421
00:49:57,783 --> 00:50:00,683
The us marines are stationed there.
That's our safest bet.

422
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,707
You think the us marines are
the best in the world?

423
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:06,731
That may be true,
but where are they now?

424
00:50:07,655 --> 00:50:09,655
I've informed the
consulate of the situation.

425
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:11,679
Where are they?

426
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,080
Tell me exactly how you
informed them?

427
00:50:13,081 --> 00:50:15,681
I tweeted at them on Twitter.

428
00:50:22,705 --> 00:50:24,705
<i>Welcome to American consulate.</i>

429
00:50:24,729 --> 00:50:26,729
<i>Unfortunately, we are closed.</i>

430
00:50:26,753 --> 00:50:28,753
Fuck!

431
00:50:31,677 --> 00:50:33,677
All foreign Navy ships have
left when I arrived.

432
00:50:34,707 --> 00:50:36,707
A I watch them sail away from port.

433
00:50:37,725 --> 00:50:39,725
Among the countless departing masts.

434
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:42,749
I saw one with the stars and stripes.

435
00:50:46,673 --> 00:50:48,673
Stop the car.

436
00:50:48,697 --> 00:50:50,697
Stop the car!

437
00:50:50,721 --> 00:50:52,721
Stop the car, I want to get out!
Stop!

438
00:51:08,745 --> 00:51:10,745
Rachel.

439
00:51:26,669 --> 00:51:28,669
Your gis are here to get you.

440
00:52:14,693 --> 00:52:17,493
<font color="#ffff00">Hanbond Chinese factory</font>

441
00:52:52,717 --> 00:52:54,717
I'm Chinese.

442
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:56,741
I'm here for nessa.

443
00:52:56,765 --> 00:52:58,765
Tundu's mom.

444
00:53:01,689 --> 00:53:03,689
Nessa!

445
00:53:14,713 --> 00:53:16,713
Anyone home?

446
00:53:16,737 --> 00:53:18,737
I've been sent here to rescue you.

447
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:20,761
By ambassador fan himself.

448
00:53:24,685 --> 00:53:26,685
You?

449
00:53:26,709 --> 00:53:28,709
Rescue us?

450
00:53:37,733 --> 00:53:39,733
I've got 18 ak-47s.

451
00:53:40,657 --> 00:53:42,657
30 m79 grenade launchers,

452
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:45,681
enough to arm a platoon.

453
00:53:48,705 --> 00:53:51,705
I have a m1911 pointed
at your head right now.

454
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,729
How the fuck are you supposed
to rescue us?

455
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:56,753
Leng, leng! Are you leng?

456
00:53:56,777 --> 00:53:58,777
Are you leng?

457
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:00,701
- Nessa?
- Yes, yes, yes!

458
00:54:00,725 --> 00:54:02,725
- What about my son?
- He's safe.

459
00:54:02,749 --> 00:54:04,749
- He's okay?
- He's okay.

460
00:54:06,673 --> 00:54:08,673
Oh, thank God!

461
00:54:10,697 --> 00:54:12,697
He's okay.

462
00:54:12,721 --> 00:54:14,721
<i>Mom, mom, I'm ok, I'm ok!</i>

463
00:54:14,745 --> 00:54:17,745
Oh, thank God! I <i>mom, I'm ok!</i>

464
00:54:17,769 --> 00:54:20,669
Because you're on a Chinese warship.

465
00:54:20,693 --> 00:54:23,693
I told you,
not to sell that porn.

466
00:54:23,717 --> 00:54:26,717
Here we go. You definitely won't
find better dumplings in Africa.

467
00:54:26,741 --> 00:54:28,741
I flew in a chef from China.

468
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,765
Fresh, just for you. Thank you.

469
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:34,689
What are you looking at?
Seen one before?

470
00:54:34,713 --> 00:54:36,713
Ever shot one of these?

471
00:54:36,737 --> 00:54:38,737
This wolf here,

472
00:54:38,761 --> 00:54:40,761
I killed myself with this gun.

473
00:54:41,685 --> 00:54:43,685
Who drew this map?

474
00:54:43,709 --> 00:54:45,869
I instructed our head of security,
laohe, how to do it.

475
00:54:46,733 --> 00:54:48,733
It still needs some work.

476
00:54:48,757 --> 00:54:50,757
Laohe, come here for a second.

477
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:54,681
Sector a to sector d.

478
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:56,705
I've told you so many times.

479
00:54:57,729 --> 00:54:59,729
Why isn't it done yet?

480
00:55:00,653 --> 00:55:02,653
I'll get on it right away.
Laohe,

481
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:04,677
write it down quickly.

482
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,701
As our head of security. What if
something happens during the operation?

483
00:55:07,725 --> 00:55:09,725
Then what?

484
00:55:13,749 --> 00:55:15,749
This is a real man's toy.

485
00:55:19,673 --> 00:55:22,673
Don't be afraid.
From now on, your safety

486
00:55:23,697 --> 00:55:25,697
will be my responsibilty.
Leng, thank you!

487
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:27,721
You're welcome.
Thank you so much!

488
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:30,745
You're welcome.

489
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:32,769
Thank you.

490
00:55:33,693 --> 00:55:35,693
Hey, kiddo. It's super yummy

491
00:55:35,717 --> 00:55:37,717
try this.

492
00:55:38,741 --> 00:55:40,741
Hey! You brat!
I'm fine. What's the big deal?

493
00:55:40,765 --> 00:55:42,765
I think she's kind of cute.

494
00:55:43,689 --> 00:55:45,689
Good news.

495
00:55:45,713 --> 00:55:47,713
Ambassador fan just called.
Tomorrow 07:00 am,

496
00:55:47,737 --> 00:55:49,737
a un rescue helicopter

497
00:55:49,761 --> 00:55:51,761
will be landing at this factory
to evacuate us.

498
00:55:51,785 --> 00:55:53,785
Just one?

499
00:55:57,709 --> 00:55:59,709
Attention please.

500
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:01,733
Everybody.

501
00:56:01,757 --> 00:56:04,657
Everybody listen to me.

502
00:56:05,681 --> 00:56:07,681
Quiet down everyone.

503
00:56:07,705 --> 00:56:12,705
Listen to me.
All Chinese employees, stand on this side.

504
00:56:12,729 --> 00:56:16,729
We are only taking Chinese people.
Management goes first.

505
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:18,653
I will lead the evacuation.

506
00:56:18,677 --> 00:56:23,677
Is that clear? All the africans
please stand this side, please.

507
00:56:23,701 --> 00:56:25,701
Clear?

508
00:56:25,725 --> 00:56:27,725
Harry.

509
00:56:27,749 --> 00:56:29,749
- No, boss, no.

510
00:56:29,773 --> 00:56:31,673
Come on, come on.

511
00:56:31,697 --> 00:56:33,697
Get moving.

512
00:56:35,721 --> 00:56:38,721
Anyone else?
Come, move. That side. That side.

513
00:56:40,745 --> 00:56:42,745
What are you doing?
She's my wife. She's pregnant

514
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:43,057
look

515
00:56:43,098 --> 00:56:44,769
any more Chinese?

516
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,693
Any other Chinese?

517
00:56:47,717 --> 00:56:49,717
Lin, listen to me.

518
00:56:49,741 --> 00:56:51,741
Everyone here is my employee.

519
00:56:51,765 --> 00:56:53,765
I'm taking them all with me.

520
00:56:56,689 --> 00:56:58,689
How?

521
00:57:01,713 --> 00:57:03,713
Come on, come on!
Don't stop, get moving.

522
00:57:03,737 --> 00:57:05,737
Get moving. For this side,

523
00:57:05,761 --> 00:57:07,661
fellow African.

524
00:57:07,685 --> 00:57:09,685
Chinese people, this side.
She married me.

525
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:11,709
So she's is one of us.

526
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:12,733
Move, move.

527
00:57:12,757 --> 00:57:14,757
You...

528
00:57:16,681 --> 00:57:18,681
Fine, stay there.
There's perfect.

529
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:21,705
Come on! Come on!
Guys, guys please, please move.

530
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:24,729
Stand that side, please.

531
00:57:24,753 --> 00:57:27,653
Please, African friends.

532
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,677
Trust me.

533
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,701
Come on, hurry uo, get moving.

534
00:57:36,725 --> 00:57:38,725
You want to be on this side, yeah?
Fuck off, bro!

535
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:41,749
What's up?

536
00:57:41,773 --> 00:57:43,773
Why?

537
00:58:04,697 --> 00:58:06,697
Give a line down the middle.

538
00:58:06,721 --> 00:58:09,721
I want to see a clear boundary line.

539
00:58:09,745 --> 00:58:12,745
Show me the line, please.

540
00:58:17,669 --> 00:58:19,669
I brought the helicopter.

541
00:58:20,693 --> 00:58:22,693
I call the shots.

542
00:58:23,717 --> 00:58:25,717
Everyone leaves tomorrow.

543
00:58:25,741 --> 00:58:27,741
Children and women leave
with the chopper.

544
00:58:27,765 --> 00:58:29,765
The men will follow me on foot.

545
00:58:34,689 --> 00:58:36,689
Everybody.

546
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:40,713
We leave together.

547
00:59:09,737 --> 00:59:11,737
Old timer,
the defensive formation out front,

548
00:59:11,761 --> 00:59:13,761
that was you, right?

549
00:59:14,685 --> 00:59:16,685
You're not bad yourself.

550
00:59:24,709 --> 00:59:27,709
Former people's liberation army of China,
14th corps, South-west region,

551
00:59:27,733 --> 00:59:29,733
recon company commander,
he jianguo.

552
00:59:30,657 --> 00:59:32,657
Former people's liberation army,
special ops birgade, South-east region,

553
00:59:32,681 --> 00:59:34,681
wolf warrior squadron, leng feng.

554
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:36,705
At your service.

555
00:59:39,729 --> 00:59:41,729
Drink in your honor.

556
00:59:53,653 --> 00:59:55,653
An hour ago, these people

557
00:59:55,677 --> 00:59:57,677
didn't know if they'd live
to see tomorrow.

558
00:59:57,701 --> 00:59:59,701
Why are they so happy?
Our African friends,

559
00:59:59,725 --> 01:00:01,725
it doesn't matter if it's war,

560
01:00:01,749 --> 01:00:03,749
disease or poverty,

561
01:00:03,773 --> 01:00:06,673
once they're around the bonfire,
all their cares go away.

562
01:00:08,697 --> 01:00:10,697
Africa. Great food.

563
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:13,721
Nice scenery.

564
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:16,745
Hot women.

565
01:00:51,669 --> 01:00:53,669
Hey.

566
01:00:53,693 --> 01:00:55,693
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

567
01:01:00,717 --> 01:01:02,877
I don't want to ride my father's
coat tail all my life.

568
01:01:03,741 --> 01:01:05,741
I love this place!

569
01:01:05,765 --> 01:01:07,665
Lions, crocodiles,

570
01:01:07,689 --> 01:01:09,689
ak-47s, sniper rifles,

571
01:01:09,713 --> 01:01:12,713
and the melody of gunfire you
can't get in a peaceful country.

572
01:01:15,737 --> 01:01:17,737
That's the most wonderful
sound in the world.

573
01:01:18,661 --> 01:01:20,661
Do you want to know why pasha
bit you today?

574
01:01:22,685 --> 01:01:25,285
Because her father was killed
ak-47s you so adore.

575
01:01:29,709 --> 01:01:31,709
If this were you,

576
01:01:32,733 --> 01:01:35,733
would you still thinl
it's wonderful??

577
01:01:57,657 --> 01:01:59,657
Oh man, look at this.

578
01:01:59,681 --> 01:02:01,681
That's a big party.

579
01:02:12,705 --> 01:02:14,705
I love these things.

580
01:02:14,729 --> 01:02:16,729
Look at them.

581
01:02:45,653 --> 01:02:46,653
Fuck!

582
01:02:46,677 --> 01:02:48,677
Pasha!

583
01:02:54,701 --> 01:02:56,701
Pasha!

584
01:03:13,725 --> 01:03:15,725
Shit!

585
01:03:27,749 --> 01:03:29,749
Let me go!

586
01:03:29,773 --> 01:03:32,673
Take out the veteran.
Athena, take out the old man.

587
01:03:38,697 --> 01:03:40,697
Stay here!

588
01:03:44,721 --> 01:03:46,721
Let her go!

589
01:04:16,745 --> 01:04:18,745
Pasha!

590
01:04:21,669 --> 01:04:23,669
Like ants when you lift a rock.

591
01:04:30,493 --> 01:04:32,493
Fuck!

592
01:04:50,717 --> 01:04:52,717
Help me!

593
01:04:52,741 --> 01:04:54,741
They got my leg!

594
01:04:55,665 --> 01:04:57,665
You're fine.

595
01:05:05,689 --> 01:05:07,689
Shit!

596
01:05:07,713 --> 01:05:09,713
Go!

597
01:05:11,737 --> 01:05:13,737
Go! Go!

598
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:11,661
I need a reload!

599
01:06:13,685 --> 01:06:15,685
Go!

600
01:06:25,709 --> 01:06:27,709
What are you doing, man?

601
01:06:33,733 --> 01:06:35,733
Fuck!

602
01:06:44,657 --> 01:06:46,657
Let's split up!

603
01:06:51,681 --> 01:06:53,681
Go! Go!

604
01:06:57,705 --> 01:06:59,705
Damn it.

605
01:07:02,729 --> 01:07:04,729
- Come on!
- Let's go!

606
01:07:26,653 --> 01:07:28,653
Pasha.

607
01:07:29,677 --> 01:07:31,677
Pasha, where are you?

608
01:07:38,701 --> 01:07:43,201
Move out of the way, bitch!

609
01:07:48,725 --> 01:07:50,725
Run!

610
01:08:56,749 --> 01:08:58,749
We know you're not a soldier anymore.

611
01:08:58,773 --> 01:09:01,673
What the fuck are you fighting for?

612
01:09:05,697 --> 01:09:07,697
Once a wolf warrior

613
01:09:07,721 --> 01:09:09,721
always a wolf warrior!

614
01:09:29,745 --> 01:09:31,745
Bear, you're on point.

615
01:09:31,769 --> 01:09:35,669
Athena, cover the exit.
I want this son of a bitch.

616
01:10:13,693 --> 01:10:16,693
Team Charlie, spotted target.
We are in pursuit.

617
01:10:17,717 --> 01:10:20,717
Sir, team bravo has target 12 o'clock.

618
01:11:14,741 --> 01:11:18,741
What the fuck? Those idiots want
us to retreat now?

619
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:35,665
<i>This is general actu</i>

620
01:11:35,689 --> 01:11:37,689
<i>everyone return to base.</i>

621
01:11:37,713 --> 01:11:39,713
<i>Return to base.</i>

622
01:11:42,737 --> 01:11:46,737
<i>Big daddy, I'm ordering you
to get the fuck back here now!</i>

623
01:12:03,661 --> 01:12:05,661
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

624
01:12:05,685 --> 01:12:07,685
I told you so many fucking times

625
01:12:07,709 --> 01:12:10,709
that we cannot kill the Chinese!

626
01:12:11,733 --> 01:12:14,733
China is a permanent member of the
un security council.

627
01:12:15,657 --> 01:12:18,657
And I need them on my side if I am
to take political power.

628
01:12:18,681 --> 01:12:20,681
You fucking asshole!

629
01:12:28,705 --> 01:12:30,705
Kill leng, and find pasha,

630
01:12:30,729 --> 01:12:32,729
and you'll be the king of
this fucking country

631
01:12:35,653 --> 01:12:37,653
as you comment, sir!

632
01:12:46,677 --> 01:12:48,677
- Hold it!
- Leng feng!

633
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,701
Who are you?

634
01:12:58,725 --> 01:13:01,245
We just fought a battle together,
what's your deal? Brither fan

635
01:13:01,749 --> 01:13:03,749
we were pretty safe before
he got here.

636
01:13:03,773 --> 01:13:05,773
Ever wonder why the rebels
show up

637
01:13:05,797 --> 01:13:07,697
after he got here?

638
01:13:07,721 --> 01:13:09,721
He's a friend of my son.

639
01:13:09,745 --> 01:13:11,745
He came here for me.

640
01:13:11,769 --> 01:13:14,669
Have you met him before?
My son always talks about him.

641
01:13:15,693 --> 01:13:17,693
So?

642
01:13:17,717 --> 01:13:21,717
I trust him! He rescued pasha
and me earlier today at the hospital

643
01:13:21,741 --> 01:13:23,741
he's been protecting us ever since.

644
01:13:23,765 --> 01:13:25,665
Let me get this straight.

645
01:13:25,689 --> 01:13:28,689
You met him the same time
your doctor friend died?

646
01:13:28,713 --> 01:13:32,713
People are getting killed around him,
while he's unscathed.

647
01:13:33,737 --> 01:13:35,737
Friend, speak for yourself.

648
01:13:37,661 --> 01:13:39,661
Get off me!

649
01:13:52,685 --> 01:13:54,685
- Lamanla (Virus).
- Lamanla?

650
01:13:55,709 --> 01:13:57,709
He has lamanla!

651
01:14:00,733 --> 01:14:02,733
Lin! He's my friend.

652
01:14:05,657 --> 01:14:07,657
He just saved my life.

653
01:14:08,681 --> 01:14:10,681
What about them?

654
01:14:11,705 --> 01:14:13,705
What about them? Last month,

655
01:14:13,729 --> 01:14:15,729
the comms center10 km away,

656
01:14:15,753 --> 01:14:19,653
one person got lamanla.
In the end, the whole place was wiped out.

657
01:14:19,677 --> 01:14:21,677
Everyone's life is at stake here.

658
01:14:22,701 --> 01:14:24,701
Look, it is not just my opinion.

659
01:14:25,725 --> 01:14:27,725
Ask them yourself.

660
01:14:39,749 --> 01:14:41,749
I'll leave.

661
01:14:45,673 --> 01:14:47,673
Wait.

662
01:14:49,697 --> 01:14:52,697
You all know what will happen to
someone infected with lamanla.

663
01:14:54,721 --> 01:14:56,721
I hope you'll always remember

664
01:14:57,745 --> 01:15:00,745
this dying man saved all of you.

665
01:15:00,769 --> 01:15:02,669
Shame on you!

666
01:15:02,693 --> 01:15:04,693
Shame on all of you!

667
01:15:56,741 --> 01:15:58,741
Leng feng!

668
01:15:58,765 --> 01:16:00,765
Leng feng!

669
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,789
Leng feng!

670
01:16:34,713 --> 01:16:36,713
How confident are you with a gun?
Soso

671
01:16:36,737 --> 01:16:39,737
there's no place in my team
for so-so.

672
01:16:41,661 --> 01:16:43,661
Trying to get me drunk so
I blurt out the truth?

673
01:16:43,685 --> 01:16:45,685
Will you blurt out the truth?

674
01:16:45,709 --> 01:16:47,709
Certainly.

675
01:16:51,733 --> 01:16:53,733
What are you like when you're drunk?

676
01:16:53,757 --> 01:16:55,757
I'll let you buy me drinks
when you come back.

677
01:17:01,681 --> 01:17:03,681
You're the one who didn't
come back.

678
01:17:07,705 --> 01:17:09,705
Come back to bed.

679
01:17:09,729 --> 01:17:11,729
Cut it out.

680
01:17:20,653 --> 01:17:22,653
When I get back

681
01:17:22,677 --> 01:17:24,677
this had better be signed.

682
01:17:38,701 --> 01:17:40,701
It's an easy death when you're
on the attack.

683
01:17:42,725 --> 01:17:45,725
But it's a hard life carrying
a survivor's guilt.

684
01:17:54,749 --> 01:17:56,749
But you didn't come back.

685
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,673
It's you who didn't come back.

686
01:18:00,697 --> 01:18:02,697
You didn't come back.

687
01:18:20,721 --> 01:18:22,721
Against who?

688
01:18:22,745 --> 01:18:24,745
Who were we fighting yesterday?

689
01:18:37,669 --> 01:18:39,669
Didn't your mom tell you that

690
01:18:39,693 --> 01:18:41,693
you shouldn't play with a gun?

691
01:18:45,717 --> 01:18:47,717
Leng!

692
01:18:48,741 --> 01:18:50,741
That was leng, only him alone.

693
01:18:52,665 --> 01:18:54,665
It was me!

694
01:18:56,689 --> 01:18:59,689
I was in the military before I worked here.

695
01:18:59,713 --> 01:19:01,713
Does anyone here

696
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,737
look like they can shoot?

697
01:19:03,761 --> 01:19:05,761
Okay.

698
01:19:27,685 --> 01:19:29,685
You're up.

699
01:19:32,709 --> 01:19:35,709
It's a shame Dr. chen didn't live
to see this.

700
01:19:35,733 --> 01:19:38,733
He discovered the presence of self-healing
properties in humans.

701
01:19:38,757 --> 01:19:42,657
In extreme rare cases, lamanla
antibodies can be found in patients.

702
01:19:42,681 --> 01:19:46,681
Among the thousands of lamanla
patients he treated

703
01:19:46,705 --> 01:19:48,705
he chanced upon one such person

704
01:19:49,729 --> 01:19:51,729
and that person is pasha.

705
01:19:52,653 --> 01:19:55,653
So pasha's not his daughter,
but his patient.

706
01:19:55,677 --> 01:19:58,677
From the analysis of pasha's blood

707
01:19:58,701 --> 01:20:01,701
he created an experimental vaccine.

708
01:20:01,725 --> 01:20:03,725
Last night was a dire situation,

709
01:20:03,749 --> 01:20:06,749
so I experimented on you,
what Dr. chen was planning to do.

710
01:20:06,773 --> 01:20:09,673
The first human trial that
he was hoping for

711
01:20:09,697 --> 01:20:12,697
injecting you with Dr. chen's
newly synthesized vaccine immunogens

712
01:20:13,721 --> 01:20:15,721
honestly speaking,

713
01:20:15,745 --> 01:20:17,745
I didn't know what would happen.

714
01:20:20,669 --> 01:20:22,669
Luckily

715
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:24,693
God was on your side.

716
01:20:31,717 --> 01:20:36,717
The population has lost faith in the
government to contain the outbreak.

717
01:20:36,741 --> 01:20:38,741
So, whoever takes pasha

718
01:20:38,765 --> 01:20:40,665
takes the country easily.

719
01:20:40,689 --> 01:20:43,689
That explains why the rebel army
is hot on our heels.

720
01:21:05,713 --> 01:21:08,713
My dad said man walked out of
Africa 100.000 years ago.

721
01:21:08,737 --> 01:21:11,737
Africa is the cradle of
modern civilization.

722
01:21:11,761 --> 01:21:14,661
Yet when the "evolved, civilized"
humans returned to this land,

723
01:21:14,685 --> 01:21:16,685
they brought along with them
nothing but suffering,

724
01:21:16,709 --> 01:21:18,709
slavery, disease and war.

725
01:21:19,733 --> 01:21:23,733
Koreans, Icelanders, slavs,

726
01:21:23,757 --> 01:21:25,657
Americans

727
01:21:25,681 --> 01:21:28,681
and over there are Chinese.
People from all over the world,

728
01:21:28,705 --> 01:21:30,705
people like my father.

729
01:21:31,729 --> 01:21:33,729
For Africa

730
01:21:33,753 --> 01:21:36,653
they gave their best years.

731
01:21:36,677 --> 01:21:38,677
In the end,

732
01:21:38,701 --> 01:21:41,701
they got to remain here for eternity.

733
01:21:52,725 --> 01:21:54,725
What's her name?

734
01:21:54,749 --> 01:21:56,749
Huh?

735
01:21:56,773 --> 01:21:58,773
The person you can't seem to forget.

736
01:22:02,697 --> 01:22:04,697
Long xiaoyun.

737
01:22:07,721 --> 01:22:09,721
She's lucky

738
01:22:10,745 --> 01:22:12,745
to have a man that loves her so much.

739
01:22:13,669 --> 01:22:15,669
Why didn't she come back?

740
01:22:26,693 --> 01:22:28,693
Sorry.

741
01:22:47,717 --> 01:22:50,717
I want you to round 'em up like cattle.
Make 'em feel safe. You understand me?

742
01:22:50,741 --> 01:22:52,741
Yes, sir.

743
01:23:02,665 --> 01:23:04,665
We got mountains to the west,

744
01:23:04,689 --> 01:23:09,250
we got forests to the east. The only smart place for them
to come is right here and wait for the rescue helicopter.

745
01:23:09,713 --> 01:23:11,713
I sure hope these Chinese people don't die.

746
01:23:12,737 --> 01:23:14,857
I'm about the only thing that can
save them right now.

747
01:23:20,661 --> 01:23:22,661
Round 'em up.

748
01:23:22,685 --> 01:23:25,685
Everybody, let's go! Let's go!
Move, move, move!

749
01:23:40,709 --> 01:23:42,709
Wait till I get out of here,

750
01:23:42,733 --> 01:23:44,733
I'm going to settle the score with them.

751
01:23:45,657 --> 01:23:47,657
Brother fan,

752
01:23:47,681 --> 01:23:49,681
cut the fucking bullshit.

753
01:23:50,705 --> 01:23:52,705
How are we going to get out?

754
01:23:53,729 --> 01:23:56,729
And besides,
what are you planning to do?

755
01:23:56,753 --> 01:23:58,653
What can you even do?

756
01:23:58,677 --> 01:24:00,677
Brother fan,

757
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:02,701
in normal times, everyone
gives in to you.

758
01:24:03,725 --> 01:24:07,725
In battle,
no one will be giving in to us.

759
01:24:07,749 --> 01:24:09,749
Shut the fuck up!

760
01:25:21,673 --> 01:25:23,673
Go to hell!

761
01:25:42,697 --> 01:25:44,697
Brother, how are you holding up?

762
01:25:44,721 --> 01:25:46,721
Not as well as back in the day.

763
01:25:51,745 --> 01:25:54,745
Your hands are for saving lives
not taking lives.

764
01:26:12,669 --> 01:26:14,669
How would wolf warriors fight
this battle?

765
01:26:58,693 --> 01:27:00,693
Go!

766
01:27:03,717 --> 01:27:05,717
Go!

767
01:28:25,741 --> 01:28:29,741
Didn't your mom tell you not to
play with weap?

768
01:28:35,665 --> 01:28:37,665
Didn't your mom tell you not
to fuck with spoiled brats?

769
01:28:37,689 --> 01:28:39,689
Let's go!

770
01:29:03,713 --> 01:29:05,713
Here's evidence of the rebel
army killing our citizens.

771
01:29:05,737 --> 01:29:08,737
Transmission received.
<i>We will gather up all the information,</i>

772
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:10,761
and have ambassador fan
submit it to the un.

773
01:29:11,685 --> 01:29:12,685
Copy that.

774
01:29:12,709 --> 01:29:16,709
<i>Oh and one more thing. The local government has
critically requested for our military assistance</i>

775
01:29:16,733 --> 01:29:19,733
<i>the chopper will arrive shortly</i>

776
01:29:19,757 --> 01:29:21,757
we're waiting for you.
Copy that!

777
01:29:29,681 --> 01:29:31,681
<font color="#ffff00">United nations</font>

778
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:41,705
get on the chopper - there're a lot
of people here who still need me.

779
01:29:42,729 --> 01:29:44,729
Lin zhi xiong!

780
01:29:46,653 --> 01:29:50,653
Women and childern must get on the chopper.
Right now I'm not a woman. I'm a doctor

781
01:29:50,677 --> 01:29:52,677
the more professional than
you when it comes to saving lives.

782
01:29:52,701 --> 01:29:54,861
But I'm more professional than
you in protecting lives!

783
01:29:55,725 --> 01:29:57,725
Pasha, are you ready to
get on the helicopter?

784
01:29:58,749 --> 01:30:00,749
Can you pass me some gauze please?

785
01:30:02,673 --> 01:30:04,673
Get on the helicopter.

786
01:30:04,697 --> 01:30:07,697
Don't be difficult, okay?

787
01:30:07,721 --> 01:30:10,721
- Excuse me?
- Excuse you my ass!

788
01:30:46,745 --> 01:30:48,745
Whoa, what was that?

789
01:30:50,669 --> 01:30:52,669
Mayday! Mayday!

790
01:30:52,693 --> 01:30:54,693
Missile strike! Tail rotor lost!

791
01:30:54,717 --> 01:30:56,717
I have control. Going down!

792
01:30:56,741 --> 01:30:58,741
Mayday! Mayday!

793
01:31:00,665 --> 01:31:02,665
Brace! Brace!

794
01:31:39,689 --> 01:31:41,689
- Go! Go!
- Go!

795
01:31:42,713 --> 01:31:44,713
Run!

796
01:32:00,737 --> 01:32:02,737
To the bunker!

797
01:32:02,761 --> 01:32:04,761
Hurry!

798
01:32:09,685 --> 01:32:11,685
Rachel!

799
01:32:13,709 --> 01:32:15,709
Wake up!

800
01:32:19,733 --> 01:32:21,733
Come on! Come on!

801
01:32:37,657 --> 01:32:39,657
Rachel!

802
01:32:50,681 --> 01:32:52,681
Go find laohe!

803
01:33:20,705 --> 01:33:22,705
Get up! Come on!

804
01:33:28,729 --> 01:33:30,729
Fuck!

805
01:33:31,653 --> 01:33:33,653
Get to the bunker!

806
01:33:57,677 --> 01:33:59,677
Go! Quickly! Go!

807
01:33:59,701 --> 01:34:01,701
Go! Quickly!

808
01:34:20,725 --> 01:34:22,725
Get ready!

809
01:34:33,749 --> 01:34:35,749
Fire!

810
01:34:36,673 --> 01:34:38,673
Kill that motherfucker!

811
01:34:40,697 --> 01:34:42,697
Reload!

812
01:34:47,721 --> 01:34:49,721
I can't aim.

813
01:34:49,745 --> 01:34:51,745
This thing's so heavy!
You wanna die!?

814
01:34:52,669 --> 01:34:54,669
Trigger that fuse and
it'll kill us all!

815
01:35:10,693 --> 01:35:12,693
Fire!

816
01:35:56,717 --> 01:35:58,717
Oh, check it.

817
01:36:01,741 --> 01:36:03,741
Three clicks down.

818
01:36:11,665 --> 01:36:13,665
Fire!

819
01:36:56,689 --> 01:36:58,689
They found the bunker!

820
01:37:01,713 --> 01:37:03,713
I got it! I got it! To the left.

821
01:37:03,737 --> 01:37:05,737
- Copy that.
- Reload!

822
01:37:05,761 --> 01:37:07,761
We're out!

823
01:37:17,685 --> 01:37:19,685
Hang on!

824
01:37:26,709 --> 01:37:28,709
Fire!

825
01:38:23,733 --> 01:38:25,733
Son of a bitch!

826
01:38:45,657 --> 01:38:48,657
Fuck! Move this fucking thing.

827
01:39:03,681 --> 01:39:05,681
Come on! Come on!

828
01:39:08,705 --> 01:39:10,705
Good, good, good.

829
01:39:41,729 --> 01:39:43,729
Fuck!

830
01:39:46,653 --> 01:39:49,653
I guess the Chinese military
ain't as lame as I thought.

831
01:39:49,677 --> 01:39:51,677
Cut the crap.

832
01:39:58,701 --> 01:40:00,701
Go!

833
01:40:00,725 --> 01:40:02,725

Hurry!

835
01:43:47,673 --> 01:43:49,673
Don't come out!

836
01:43:54,697 --> 01:43:56,697
Track the signals and verify
targets positions!

837
01:44:22,721 --> 01:44:24,721
Godfather!

838
01:44:24,745 --> 01:44:28,745
Mom!

839
01:45:15,669 --> 01:45:18,669
Sir, we have triangulated on the phone's position!

840
01:45:54,693 --> 01:45:57,693
Sir, we recieved orders from command!
Fire!

841
01:48:12,717 --> 01:48:14,717
Now it's personal.

842
01:48:18,741 --> 01:48:20,741
Long xiaoyun.

843
01:48:27,665 --> 01:48:29,665
Is that your girl?

844
01:48:30,689 --> 01:48:32,689
She's pretty.

845
01:48:32,713 --> 01:48:34,713
Blood... For blood.

846
01:50:30,737 --> 01:50:32,737
Please don't fight!

847
01:50:36,661 --> 01:50:38,661
Look at them.

848
01:50:40,685 --> 01:50:43,685
You're gonna die for this people.

849
01:50:49,709 --> 01:50:52,709
I was born for them.

850
01:50:56,733 --> 01:51:00,733
People like you will always
be inferior to people like me

851
01:51:00,757 --> 01:51:03,657
get used to it.
Get fucking used to it.

852
01:51:41,681 --> 01:51:43,681
That's fucking history.

853
01:52:24,705 --> 01:52:26,705
Welcome back.

854
01:53:23,729 --> 01:53:26,729
The war zone is up ahead.
We can't get through.

855
01:53:51,653 --> 01:53:55,653
Unidentified vehicle convoy

856
01:54:04,677 --> 01:54:06,677

Drive.

859
01:54:58,749 --> 01:55:00,749
It's the Chinese.
Hold your fire.

860
01:55:03,673 --> 01:55:08,673
Hold your fire! It's Chinese.

861
01:57:52,722 --> 01:57:54,722
<i>Leng feng.</i>

862
01:57:57,746 --> 01:57:59,746
Commander!
<i>I see you're enjoying your life.</i>

863
01:58:00,670 --> 01:58:02,670
Not planning on rejoining

864
01:58:02,694 --> 01:58:04,694
