1
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,973
 I don't know
about you, it's too hot today, isn't it?

2
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:01,310
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,189
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.

4
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,025
So, please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...

5
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,028
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.

6
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,948
Come on, guys, time to go home.

7
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,826
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,206
 Do we have to?
Yes, we do.

9
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,752
I'll make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.

10
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,796
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

11
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,508
PlERS: Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,510
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,013
Beat up another 10-year-old?

14
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,682
- This one deserved it.
Yeah.

15
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:44,520
 Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:48,691
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least l'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,947
"Don't kill Cedric."

18
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,033
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:02,371
- Shut up.
"He's going to kill me, Mum."

20
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,041
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,503
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,129
She dead?

23
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,549
Is she dead?

24
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,384
Is she a dead Pott-?

25
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,011
Whoa.

26
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,400
 Dudley.
Dudley, let's go.

27
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,155
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

28
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,283
- l'm not doing anything.
We're getting out of here, Dudley.

29
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,993
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

30
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,296
Dudley, run.

31
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,333
Expecto Patronum.

32
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,989
Mrs. Figg.

33
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,954
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

34
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,623
They might come back.

35
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,877
 Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?

36
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:59,006
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
- l don't understand. How do you know-?

37
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,384
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

38
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,636
Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?

39
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,929
Uh-huh.

40
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,933
After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...

41
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,769
...did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?

42
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,605
Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.

43
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,900
Now, get inside and stay there.

44
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,694
Expect someone will be in touch soon.

45
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,738
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

46
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,542
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.

47
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,836
There's sweat. There's stifling.

48
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,921
Diddykins?

49
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,257
Is that you?

50
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,596
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

51
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,808
We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.

52
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,102
Who did this to you, boy?

53
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,443
Happy, are we, now? Eh?

54
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,279
You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.

55
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,282
Vernon, don't say that.

56
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,786
 Well, just look at him, Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.

57
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,122
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

58
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,126
This is the last l'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.

59
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,798
VERNON WHIMPERING]

60
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,142
- Dear Mr. Potter.
What?

61
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,564
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

62
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:43,486
...you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.

63
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,738
As a clear violation...

64
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,992
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

65
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,286
...you are hereby expelled...

66
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:56,165
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

67
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:01,295
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

68
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,760
Justice.

69
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,191
He's not very well.

70
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,539
Sorry, Hedwig.

71
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,566
WOMAN
Very clean, these Muggles.

72
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,777
 Tonks, for God's sake.
Unnatural.

73
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,283
Professor Moody.

74
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,786
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.

75
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,375
But where are we going?
The letter said l've been expelled.

76
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,961
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

77
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,714
- But the letter said-
- Dumbledore persuaded the minister...

78
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,300
...to suspend your expulsion,
pending a formal hearing.

79
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,676
- A hearing?
Uh-huh.

80
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,763
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

81
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,682
Shh! Not here, Nymphadora.

82
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,686
Don't call me Nymphadora.

83
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:32,154
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.

84
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,998
Come on, you, around the corner.

85
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,709
In you go, son.

86
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,754
There've been no sightings.

87
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,630
No deaths. No proof.

88
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,675
SlRlUS: He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough...

89
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:20,763
 Yes, but guarding
you-know-what is the most important...

90
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,476
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

91
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,770
SlRlUS:
Was he able to protect Harry last year?

92
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,022
Well, tonight l say
it's time to take action.

93
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,231
Ooh!

94
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,442
 Cornelius Fudge is a politician
first and a wizard second.

95
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,779
- His instinct would be to ignore it-
Shh. Keep your voices down.

96
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,211
Heavens, you're all right.

97
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:00,010
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait
until after the meeting's finished.

98
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:05,307
Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.

99
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,142
Yeah.

100
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:14,608
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.

101
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:19,655
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...

102
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,116
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

103
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,161
Oh, the shame.

104
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,260
 Freaks.
There, there, mistress.

105
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,847
 Scum ofthe earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.

106
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,147
Oh, Harry.

107
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,778
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

108
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:07,161
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.

109
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,496
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.

110
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,374
- lt's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

111
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,502
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

112
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,339
So, what is this place?

113
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,217
- lt's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

114
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,511
It's a secret society.

115
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:37,065
We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.

116
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,275
- Only...
- Only what?

117
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,653
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

118
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,830
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...

119
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,833
...the one who fought him,
who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

120
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,211
 Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

121
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,755
 Don't bottle it up,
though, mate. Let it out.

122
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,423
If you're all done shouting...

123
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,888
SlRlUS
If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.

124
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,974
If it wasn't for Harry, we wouldn't
even know Voldemort was back.

125
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,726
He's not a child, Molly.

126
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,270
But he's not an adult either.

127
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,482
- He's not James, Sirius.
SlRlUS: Well, he's not your son.

128
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,817
He's as good as.

129
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,903
- who else has he got?
Hey, Ginny.

130
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,784
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon,
just like his godfather.

131
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,702
SlRlUS:
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

132
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,788
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

133
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,414
SlRlUS:
- about your supposed reformation.

134
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,876
- l know better.
So why don't you tell him?

135
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,753
 Get off it.
Quick.

136
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,547
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

137
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,132
- Stop it.
Get off, you bloody cat.

138
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,552
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

139
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,139
 Hermione, l hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

140
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,978
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.

141
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,319
Hi, Mum.

142
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,030
You hungry, Harry?

143
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,825
You sure you're all right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.

144
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,668
SlRlUS:
Ohh.

145
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,463
This is very, very peculiar.

146
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,364
SlRlUS:
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

147
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,204
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

148
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,541
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

149
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,001
Why?

150
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,128
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

151
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,422
No one in their right mind
could believe that-

152
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,467
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

153
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,178
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

154
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,265
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

155
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,893
The last time Voldemort gained power...

156
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,396
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

157
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:25,484
Now he's returned, and l'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...

158
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,570
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

159
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:34,534
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.

160
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,330
Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.

161
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:43,085
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

162
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,714
He's been recruiting heavily, and
we've been attempting to do the same.

163
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:52,427
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.

164
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,182
We believe...

165
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,395
Sirius.

166
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,901
Something he didn't have last time.

167
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,405
You mean like a weapon?

168
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,930
Harry.

169
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,349
HOPKlRK:
You are hereby expelled.

170
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:42,310
Before the entire Wizengamot.

171
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,447
Trains. Underground.

172
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,907
Ingenious, these Muggles.

173
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,546
Ahh.

174
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:09,147
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

175
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,779
Dumbledore: ls he daft,
or is he dangerous?

176
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,554
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

177
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,766
Interdepartmental memos.

178
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:48,603
We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.

179
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,567
[WHlSPERlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY

180
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,445
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.

181
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,991
- They changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?

182
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,285
In five minutes.

183
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,170
Department of Mysteries.

184
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:20,844
And l'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

185
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,690
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

186
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,402
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.

187
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,989
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

188
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,116
- Yes?
- Mm.

189
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,328
I'm not allowed in, l'm afraid.

190
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,706
Good luck, Harry.

191
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,171
Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...

192
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,299
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

193
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:03,094
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.

194
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,348
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag-

195
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,440
...Brian Dumbledore.

196
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:19,027
You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...

197
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,738
- ...had been changed, did you?
- l must have missed it.

198
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,038
The charges?

199
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,707
The charges against the accused
are as follows:

200
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,542
"That he did knowingly...

201
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,254
...and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...

202
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,424
...produce a Patronus Charm...

203
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,844
...in the presence of a Muggle."

204
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,306
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but-

205
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,935
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

206
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,281
Dementors?

207
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,575
In Little Whinging?

208
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,078
That's quite clever.

209
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:22,924
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...

210
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:27,595
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event-

211
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,361
What did they look like?

212
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:49,367
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

213
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,288
Not the boys. The Dementors.

214
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:57,125
Oh, right, right. Well, um, big.

215
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:02,922
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

216
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,482
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

217
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,529
I'm sure l must have misunderstood you,
professor.

218
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:32,202
Dementors are, after all, under
the control of the Ministry of Magic.

219
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,752
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

220
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,172
 That would be disturbing
indeed, Madam Undersecretary...

221
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,051
...which is why l'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

222
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,228
Of course, there is someone...

223
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,189
...who might be behind the attack.

224
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:08,822
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

225
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:13,535
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

226
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,496
He is not back.

227
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,587
In the matter of Harry Potter...

228
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,590
...the law clearly states...

229
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,306
Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.

230
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,643
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

231
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,688
...to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?

232
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,658
Those in favor of conviction?

233
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:07,422
Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?

234
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,771
Cleared of all charges.

235
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,568
Professor.

236
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,584
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

237
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,230
What's life without a little risk?

238
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:23,248
Original Order of the Phoenix.

239
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,935
It's been 14 years.

240
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,982
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.

241
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,322
Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?

242
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:02,036
It feels like it did before.

243
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,042
You keep it.

244
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:12,922
Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.

245
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,968
I'll see you at the train.

246
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,556
I love you.

247
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,441
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

248
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,109
Better enjoy it while you can.

249
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:18,571
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.

250
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:25,119
- What'd l tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

251
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,164
It's only Malfoy.

252
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:51,979
Hi, guys.

253
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,815
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.

254
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,413
What is it?

255
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,835
 What's what?
That. Pulling the carriage.

256
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,004
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

257
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,690
You're not going mad.

258
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,528
I can see them too.

259
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,365
You're just as sane as l am.

260
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:02,216
What an interesting necklace.

261
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,927
It's a charm, actually.

262
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,889
Keeps away the Nargles.

263
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,186
Hungry.

264
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,813
I hope there's pudding.

265
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,649
What's a Nargle?

266
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,401
HERMlONE
No idea.

267
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,749
Good evening, children.

268
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,753
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

269
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,964
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

270
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,717
...who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...

271
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:48,346
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

272
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:53,184
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

273
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,779
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you-

274
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:18,793
She was at my hearing.

275
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,169
She works for Fudge.

276
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:26,050
UMBRlDGE: Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.

277
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:31,097
And how lovely to see all your bright...

278
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:34,100
...happy faces smiling up at me.

279
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:39,647
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

280
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,863
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

281
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:53,661
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

282
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:56,289
Although each headmaster...

283
00:31:56,456 --> 00:32:01,294
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

284
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,556
Let us preserve
what must be preserved...

285
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:17,226
...perfect what can be perfected...

286
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:21,606
...and prune practices
that ought to be...

287
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,566
...prohibited.

288
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,202
That really was most illuminating.

289
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,707
 llluminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

290
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,627
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...

291
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,380
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

292
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,902
Dean, Seamus.

293
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,321
- Good holiday?
All right.

294
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,907
Better than Seamus', anyway.

295
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:20,039
- Why not?
- Let me see. Uh, because of you.

296
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:23,834
The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.

297
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,336
What, your mum believes them?

298
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,421
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.

299
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,675
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then, like your stupid mother.

300
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,909
- You all right?
- Fine.

301
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,870
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

302
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:04,208
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- l said, l'm fine, Ron.

303
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:12,299
Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.

Bring it over here. Over here.

307
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,349
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

308
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,201
Good morning, children.

Fail to do so,

Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.

315
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,737
But you'll be pleased to know,
from now on...

316
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,407
...you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...

317
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,244
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

318
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,206
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

319
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:08,916
Using spells? Ha-ha!

320
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,545
Well, l can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

321
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,840
We're not gonna use magic?

322
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:21,011
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure, risk-free way.

323
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,931
What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.

324
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,059
UMBRlDGE: Students will raise their
hands when they speak in my class.

325
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,107
It is the view of the Ministry...

326
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:36,026
...that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...

327
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,153
...to get you through your examinations...

328
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,781
...which, after all,
is what school is all about.

329
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,742
And how's theory supposed to prepare us
for what's out there?

330
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,953
There is nothing out there, dear.

331
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:49,123
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?

332
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,585
Oh, l don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.

333
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:07,766
Now, let me make this quite plain.

334
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,768
You have been told...

335
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:15,316
...that a certain dark wizard
is at large once again.

336
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:20,613
- This is a lie.
- lt's not a lie. l saw him. l fought him.

337
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,406
UMBRlDGE:
Detention, Mr. Potter.

338
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,742
Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?

339
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,328
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.

340
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,663
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

341
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,332
Enough!

342
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,667
Enough.

343
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:37,463
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

344
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,114
UMBRlDGE:
Come in.

345
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,288
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

346
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,207
Sit.

347
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:24,802
You're going to be doing some lines
for me today, Mr. Potter.

348
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,845
No, not with your quill.

349
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:30,265
Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.

350
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:36,814
Now...

351
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:43,654
...l want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."

352
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,616
How many times?

353
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:52,746
Well, let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.

354
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,417
You haven't given me any ink.

355
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,085
Oh, you won't need any ink.

356
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,804
Yes?

357
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,523
- Nothing.
- That's right.

358
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:06,403
Because you know, deep down...

359
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,655
...you deserve to be punished.

360
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,992
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

361
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:17,831
Go on.

362
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,134
 Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

363
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:30,928
Get out of class whenever you like.

364
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,848
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

365
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,184
Care for another?

366
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,269
 l'm not asking you
to write all of it for me.

367
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,479
HERMlONE:
Oh, please.

368
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:43,023
 l've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

369
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,317
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

370
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:49,238
Hermione, you're honestly
the most wonderful person I've ever met.

371
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:53,659
- And if l'm ever rude to you again...
- l'll know you've gone back to normal.

372
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,791
What's wrong with your hand?

373
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,793
Nothing.

374
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,963
The other hand.

375
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,300
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

376
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,678
Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.

377
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:14,972
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

378
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,558
Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.

379
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,687
- lf the parents knew about this...
- l haven't got any of those, have l, Ron?

380
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,942
Harry, you've got to report this.

381
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,654
- lt's perfectly simple. You're being-
- No, it's not.

382
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,657
Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simple.

383
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,743
You don't understand.

384
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,248
Then help us to.

385
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,848
Dear Padfoot...

386
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,100
...l hope you're all right.

387
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:04,897
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

388
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:12,279
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
l feel more alone than ever.

389
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,450
I know you, of all people,
will understand.

390
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,736
Hello, Harry Potter.

391
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:59,993
- Your feet. Aren't they cold?
- Bit.

392
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,957
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

393
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,585
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

394
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,678
 What are they?
They're called Thestrals.

395
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:24,309
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...

396
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,855
Different.

397
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:34,361
But why can't the others see them?

398
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:38,031
They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.

399
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,786
So you've known someone
who's died, then?

400
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,579
My mum.

401
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:50,043
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

402
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,505
...and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.

403
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:56,049
- l was 9.
- l'm sorry.

404
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,844
Yes, it was rather horrible.

405
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:04,349
I do feel very sad about it sometimes,
but I've got Dad.

406
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,562
We both believe you, by the way.

407
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:15,277
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...

408
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:18,572
...and the Ministry and the Prophet
are conspiring against you.

409
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:23,076
Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.

410
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,578
I don't think that's true.

411
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:30,083
But l suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.

412
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,044
What do you mean?

413
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,546
Well, if I were You-Know-Who...

414
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,592
...l'd want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...

415
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,470
...because if it's just you alone...

416
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,639
...you're not as much of a threat.

417
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:07,037
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? l'm hungry.

418
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,458
Harry.

419
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:14,544
Can l join you?

420
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:19,591
UMBRlDGE: Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?

421
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,552
McGONAGALL: I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...

422
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,973
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

423
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,809
UMBRlDGE:
So silly of me, but it sounds...

424
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:33,105
...as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...

425
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,606
...Minerva.

426
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:39,236
Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.

427
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,988
I am sorry, dear.

428
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,492
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

429
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,787
...and by extension, the minister himself.

430
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,539
I am a tolerant woman...

431
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:55,794
...but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.

432
00:45:57,547 --> 00:45:59,339
Disloyalty.

433
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:05,011
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.

434
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,682
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.

435
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:21,987
What's happened to Dumbledore?

436
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:24,698
Having already revolutionized...

437
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:27,784
...the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts...

438
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:33,582
...Dolores Umbridge will,
as high inquisitor, have powers...

439
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:39,379
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

440
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,306
Just one question, dear.

441
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:53,685
You've been in this post
how long, exactly?

442
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:05,572
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

443
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,741
Yes.

444
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,785
But you were unsuccessful?

445
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,413
Obviously.

446
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:50,200
Could you please predict something
for me?

447
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:53,119
I'm sorry?

448
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,585
Move those mouths.

449
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,803
One teensy little prophecy?

450
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:17,143
Pity.

451
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:20,105
No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.

452
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,482
Yes, l do. Something dark.

453
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:27,279
You are in grave danger.

454
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,490
Lovely.

455
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,836
Cho. What's going on?

456
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:45,338
It's Professor Trelawney.

457
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,237
Ooh!

458
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:18,663
Sixteen years l've lived and taught here.

459
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:21,750
Hogwarts is my home.

460
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,545
You can't do this.

461
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,257
Actually, I can.

462
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,517
Something you'd like to say?

463
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,354
Oh, there are several things
I would like to say.

464
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,272
There... Shh. Shh.

465
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:03,083
Professor McGonagall, might l ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?

466
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,836
Sybil, dear. This way.

467
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,505
Thank you.

468
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:13,718
UMBRlDGE: Dumbledore, may l remind
you that under the terms...

469
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,138
...of Educational Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister-

470
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:20,475
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.

471
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:24,229
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

472
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:27,440
That power remains with the headmaster.

473
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,694
For now.

474
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:39,119
Don't you all have studying to do?

475
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,453
Professor.

476
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,415
Professor?

477
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,668
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

478
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:48,962
Professor Dumbledore.

479
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,766
HERMlONE:
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

480
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,519
We're not learning how
to defend ourselves.

481
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:07,313
We're not learning how
to pass our OWLs.

482
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,733
She's taking over the entire school.

483
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,571
FUDGE Security has been
and will remain the Ministry's top priority.

484
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:17,574
Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...

485
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:20,618
...that these disappearances
are the work...

486
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:24,164
...of notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.

487
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,499
SlRlUS:
Harry.

488
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,418
Sirius.

489
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,838
- What are you doing here?
SlRlUS: Answering your letter.

490
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,924
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?

491
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,010
Training you to kill half-breeds?

492
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:40,180
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
SlRlUS: Well, l'm not surprised.

493
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:44,559
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

494
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:45,769
Combat?

495
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,189
What does he think,
we're forming some sort of wizard army?

496
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,732
That's exactly what he thinks.

497
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,861
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.

498
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,698
He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.

499
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:02,535
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

500
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:05,872
...but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.

501
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,708
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...

502
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:12,879
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

503
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:17,008
Voldemort is on the move.

504
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,343
Well, what can we do?

505
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,929
Someone's coming.

506
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,223
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

507
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:28,394
But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.

508
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,242
He really is out there, isn't he?

509
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:46,746
We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.

510
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:51,084
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how,
we need someone who will.

511
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,270
Harry.

512
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,240
 This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?

513
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,616
I'm a nutter, remember?

514
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:28,288
Look on the bright side: you can't
be any worse than old toad face.

515
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:32,000
- Thanks, Ron.
- l'm here for you, mate.

516
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,836
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

517
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:37,130
HERMlONE:
Just a couple of people.

518
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,469
Lovely spot.

519
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:49,434
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

520
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:51,769
Matey, come back here.

521
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,319
Um...

522
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,362
Hi.

523
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,657
So you all know why we're here.

524
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:06,075
We need a teacher.

525
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,954
A proper teacher.

526
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:13,416
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.

527
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,335
- Why?
Why?

528
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,587
Because You-Know-Who's back,
you tosspot.

529
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:19,380
- So he says.
HERMlONE: So Dumbledore says.

530
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:21,633
So Dumbledore says because he says.

531
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,177
The point is, where's the proof?

532
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:28,598
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

533
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:35,355
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

534
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,689
Come on, Hermione.

535
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,067
They're here because they think
I'm some sort of freak.

536
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,861
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?

537
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,616
HERMlONE:
Yes.

538
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:49,535
I've seen it.

539
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,829
Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.

540
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:56,626
And he killed a basilisk, with the sword
in Dumbledore's office.

541
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,044
It's true.

542
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,964
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.

543
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:05,051
Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.

544
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,552
Wait.

545
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:11,766
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

546
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:15,520
...but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.

547
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:19,524
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.

548
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:23,194
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, l'm not.

549
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:30,410
Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.

550
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,914
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

551
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,582
But out there...

552
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,461
...when you're a second away
from being murdered...

553
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:44,340
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

554
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:48,928
You don't know what that's like.

555
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,606
HERMlONE:
You're right, Harry, we don't.

556
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,443
That's why we need your help.

557
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,529
Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...

558
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:09,907
...Voldemort...

559
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,079
He's really back?

560
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,853
Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...

561
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:40,646
...where Umbridge won't find out.

562
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,982
- The Shrieking Shack.
- lt's too small.

563
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:46,110
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

564
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:48,362
Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?

565
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,697
HERMlONE:
Who cares?

566
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:55,161
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,
breaking the rules?

567
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,622
Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?

568
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:02,001
Anyway, at least we know
one positive thing that came from today.

569
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,461
What's that?

570
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,840
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?

571
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:13,679
 Right. Over the next few days,
we should each come up...

572
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,682
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

573
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:20,686
We've got to make sure, wherever it is,
there's no chance she can find us.

574
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,688
Will do, Harry.

575
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:35,535
 All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

576
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,329
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

577
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,499
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.

578
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:21,956
HERMlONE: You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.

579
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,249
The what?

580
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:25,835
HERMlONE: lt's also known as
the Come and Go Room.

581
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:29,422
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

582
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,258
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

583
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:36,179
So say you really needed the toilet...

584
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:42,185
Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.

585
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:47,231
It's brilliant. lt's like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.

586
00:58:58,285 --> 00:58:59,785
Expelliarmus.

587
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:01,621
Whoa!

588
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:06,292
I'm hopeless.

589
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:10,254
You're just flourishing your wand
too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.

590
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:17,637
UMBRlDGE: You will please copy
the approved text four times...

591
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,806
...to ensure maximum retention.

592
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:24,894
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.

593
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,897
NEVILLE Expelliarmus.
UMBRlDGE: Wands away.

594
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:43,120
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.

595
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,498
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.

596
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:49,252
So, um, come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

597
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,176
Stupefy!

598
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:06,519
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

599
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,985
Don't worry. l'll go easy on you.

600
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,362
Thanks, Ronald.

601
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,200
 Come on, Ron.
Come on, Ron.

602
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:24,245
 You can do it.
Come on, Ron.

603
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,831
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

604
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,922
Stupefy.

605
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,888
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

606
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:47,893
I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?

607
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,648
It was completely intentional.

608
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:21,218
UMBRlDGE: Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?

609
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,475
Now, focus on a fixed point
and try again.

610
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,226
Expelliarmus.

611
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:34,148
Very good. Keep your concentration.

612
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:37,777
Great.

613
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,613
A little higher.

614
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:48,079
Whoa!

615
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,957
I'm okay. I'm okay.

616
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:12,603
 Stupefy.
Stupefy.

617
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:17,525
UMBRlDGE: Those wishing tojoin
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

618
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:20,569
...may sign up
in the high inquisitor's office.

619
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,363
Diminuendo.

620
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:32,581
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

621
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,959
Believing in yourself.

622
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:37,253
 Expelliarmus.
Levicorpus. Got it.

623
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:39,004
Think of it this way.

624
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:43,175
Every great wizard in history
has started out...

625
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:47,388
...as nothing more
than what we are now: students.

626
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:50,516
If they can do it, why not us?

627
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,445
 Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.

628
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,990
Expelliarmus.

629
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:10,202
Expelliarmus.

630
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,042
Reducto.

631
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:33,559
 Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.

632
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,061
Expelliarmus.

633
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,525
Expelliarmus.

634
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:49,283
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

635
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:53,078
So that's it for this lesson.

636
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,748
Now, we're not gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays.

637
01:03:57,125 --> 01:04:00,085
So just keep practicing on your own
as best you can.

638
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,589
And well done, everyone.
Great, great work.

639
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:09,845
Well done, mate.

640
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,430
Thanks.

641
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,480
See you after Christmas.

642
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:30,991
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

643
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,120
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

644
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:36,789
Merry Christmas.

645
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:39,250
 Thank you so much.
Not at all. Merry Christmas.

646
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,086
 Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

647
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:44,129
- Merry Christmas.
Have a good Christmas.

648
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,882
 Have a great Christmas, Luna.
We've been thinking.

649
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,468
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

650
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,304
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils-

651
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,974
Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?

652
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:10,656
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

653
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:13,200
Yeah. l'm okay.

654
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,704
Anyway, it's worth it.

655
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:25,212
It's just, learning all this...

656
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:29,466
...makes me wonder whether,
if he'd known it...

657
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:32,344
Cedric did know this stuff.

658
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,347
He was really good.

659
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:38,684
It's just, Voldemort was better.

660
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:45,024
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

661
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:49,194
I've never been able
to stun anything before.

662
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,039
Mistletoe.

663
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,461
Probably full of Nargles, though.

664
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,213
What are Nargles?

665
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,674
No idea.

666
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,907
Well, how was it?

667
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:37,409
Wet.

668
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,578
I mean, she was sort of crying.

669
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,914
That bad at it, are you?

670
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:44,833
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

671
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:49,838
Cho spends half her time
crying these days.

672
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,257
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.

673
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,595
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?

674
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:04,478
Well, obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric...

675
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:07,731
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

676
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:11,110
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

677
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:15,030
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

678
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:20,536
One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.

679
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:23,956
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon...

680
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:41,432
Harry.

681
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:53,277
SlRlUS:
Voldemort may be after something.

682
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:56,947
Something he didn't have last time.

683
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,032
Harry.

684
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,952
Harry.

685
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:36,445
 In the dream,
were you standing next to the victim...

686
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,113
...or looking down at the scene?

687
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:41,533
Neither. lt was like l...

688
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,203
Will you please just tell me
what's happening?

689
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,705
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.

690
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:49,291
Make sure he's found
by the right people.

691
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,043
 Sir.
Phineas.

692
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:53,504
You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.

693
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,298
Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...

694
01:08:56,466 --> 01:09:00,636
...and his children will be arriving there
soon by Portkey.

695
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:03,889
 They've got him, Albus.
It was close, but they think he'll make it.

696
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,225
What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.

697
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,601
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to-

698
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:08,811
VOLDEMORT WHISPERS]

699
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,229
Look at me!

700
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:18,737
What's happening to me?

701
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,497
You wished to see me, headmaster?

702
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:33,585
Oh, Severus. l'm afraid we can't wait.
Not even till the morning.

703
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:36,880
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

704
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:43,262
It appears there's a connection...

705
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,764
...between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.

706
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:50,102
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

707
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,480
Pray he remains ignorant.

708
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:56,942
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

709
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:01,780
- ...he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...

710
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:03,824
...unhinge it.

711
01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:07,369
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

712
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,788
...to invade the minds of his victims...

713
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:13,542
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

714
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:19,464
Only after extracting the last exquisite
ounce of agony...

715
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:23,927
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

716
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:25,304
...kill them.

717
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,724
Used properly,
the power of Occlumency...

718
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:32,394
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

719
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:37,316
In these lessons, I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.

720
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:40,986
You will attempt to resist.

721
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,738
Prepare yourself.

722
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:46,700
Legilimens.

723
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:58,420
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

724
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:25,948
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

725
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:29,826
Here we go.

726
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,162
Daddy's back. Oh.

727
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:38,961
Sit down, everybody, sit down.
That's it. Now, presents.

728
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:43,507
 And a nice big box for Ron.
Big box for you. And, um...

729
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,512
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

730
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,973
- l want to see your faces.
Yes.

731
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,558
 Try it on.
Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

732
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:58,021
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

733
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:01,066
 Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

734
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:03,235
Oh, Harry, Harry.

735
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:05,320
There you are.

736
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,156
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

737
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,575
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

738
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,744
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

739
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,621
 Thank you.
Has everybody got?

740
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:16,164
Fred? George?

741
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,875
- Hermione.
A Christmas toast.

742
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,919
To Mr. Harry Potter...

743
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:24,756
...without whom I would not be here.

744
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,679
- Harry.
Harry.

745
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,097
Harry.

746
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,684
 That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.

747
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:38,228
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

748
01:12:39,147 --> 01:12:41,898
I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.

749
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,193
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.

750
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,195
HERMlONE:
No more than usual, Ron.

751
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:49,239
I don't know why...

752
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:59,833
Nasty brat, standing there
as bold as brass.

753
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:04,755
Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.

754
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:07,924
Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.

755
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,969
- lf my poor mistress only knew...
SlRlUS: Kreacher!

756
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,972
That's enough of your bile.
Away with you!

757
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,141
Of course, master.

758
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:20,979
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

759
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:25,192
Sorry about that.

760
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:29,446
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

761
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:31,865
Not to me, anyway.

762
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,659
What, you grew up here?

763
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,079
SlRlUS:
This is my parents' house.

764
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:41,249
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

765
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:45,670
About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.

766
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:49,424
This is the Black family tree.

767
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:52,469
My deranged cousin.

768
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:55,347
I hated the lot of them.

769
01:13:55,515 --> 01:14:00,227
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

770
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:07,234
My mother did that after I ran away.

771
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:11,446
Charming woman.

772
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,366
I was 16.

773
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,618
Where did you go?

774
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:19,955
Round your dad's.

775
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,000
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

776
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:27,629
I see him so much in you, Harry.

777
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:30,465
You are so very much alike.

778
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,385
I'm not so sure.

779
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:35,887
Sirius, when l was...

780
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:43,228
When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching.

781
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:45,897
I was the snake.

782
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:49,693
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...

783
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:54,072
...there was a moment
when l wanted to-

784
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:02,080
This connection
between me and Voldemort.

785
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:06,334
What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more like him?

786
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:12,591
I just feel so angry all the time.

787
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:17,304
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...

788
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:21,057
...something's gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?

789
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:26,938
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harry.

790
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:31,109
You're not a bad person.

791
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:36,281
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.

792
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:38,033
You understand?

793
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:45,165
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

794
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:49,794
We've all got both light and dark
inside of us.

795
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,798
What matters
is the part we choose to act on.

796
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,053
That's who we really are.

797
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,558
Harry, time to go.

798
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:09,606
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

799
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,358
You'll see.

800
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:13,860
Come on.

801
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,750
VOICES WHISPERING]

802
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:52,482
Really?

803
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,277
HERMlONE:
Harry. Harry.

804
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,362
Hagrid's back.

805
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,158
I'm sorry.

806
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:19,551
UMBRlDGE:
I will say this one last time.

807
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:22,220
I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.

808
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:25,390
I told you. I've been away for me health.

809
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:29,894
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

810
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:34,899
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.

811
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:39,446
If l were you,
I shouldn't get too used to being back.

812
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:42,907
In fact, l mightn't bother
unpacking at all.

813
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:04,929
This is top-secret, right?

814
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:08,224
Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.

815
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:09,893
- Giants?
Shh.

816
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:12,103
You found them?

817
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:16,191
Well, they're not that hard to find, to be
perfectly honest. They're so big, see?

818
01:18:17,068 --> 01:18:20,111
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.

819
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:22,947
But l wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.

820
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,575
- Death Eaters?
Yes.

821
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:29,371
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

822
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:32,248
- Did they?
- l gave them Dumbledore's message.

823
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:36,503
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them. l suppose.

824
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:41,424
And they did this to you?

825
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,093
Not exactly, no.

826
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:48,306
Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.

827
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:04,406
It's changing out there.

828
01:19:04,824 --> 01:19:06,408
Just like last time.

829
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:09,494
There's a storm coming, Harry.

830
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:13,331
We'd all best be ready when she does.

831
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,371
 We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...

832
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:56,374
...in the early hours of yesterday evening
did escape.

833
01:19:56,542 --> 01:20:00,211
And of course, the Muggle prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.

834
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:02,464
We strongly suspect...

835
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,300
...that the breakout was engineered...

836
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:09,679
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

837
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:14,058
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

838
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:19,063
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.

839
01:20:30,201 --> 01:20:32,494
Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.

840
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,830
He's gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.

841
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:37,123
Harry.

842
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,626
I, uh...

843
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,837
I wanted to apologize.

844
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:47,592
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.

845
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:53,681
So, what I'm really trying to say
is that I believe you.

846
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:02,232
Neville?

847
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:16,955
Fourteen years ago...

848
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:21,376
...a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange...

849
01:21:21,544 --> 01:21:24,754
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.

850
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:29,300
She tortured them for information...

851
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:31,636
...but they never gave in.

852
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:35,807
I'm quite proud to be their son.

853
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:40,645
But l'm not sure
I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.

854
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:50,697
We're gonna make them proud, Neville.
That's a promise.

855
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:58,663
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

856
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:02,250
Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.

857
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:03,835
George, your turn now.

858
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,505
Expecto Patronum.

859
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:11,843
A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce...

860
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:15,847
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

861
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:17,265
Wow, that was really good.

862
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:19,517
Fantastic, Ginny.

863
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:23,730
Remember, your Patronus can only protect
you for as long as you stay focused.

864
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:26,190
So focus, Luna.

865
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:31,613
Think of the happiest thing you can.

866
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,740
Expecto Patronum.

867
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:36,784
- l'm trying.
l know. lt's good.

868
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,954
This is really advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so well.

869
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:44,375
Expecto Patronum.

870
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,753
UMBRlDGE:
I'll make short work of this.

871
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:32,090
Bombarda Maxima.

872
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,734
Get them.

873
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,653
UMBRlDGE:
Been watching them for weeks.

874
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:55,738
And see, "Dumbledore's Army"...

875
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:59,867
...proof of what l've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

876
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:03,287
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

877
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:04,997
...never fooled us for a minute.

878
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:07,250
We saw your lies for what they were:

879
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:11,212
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.

880
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,422
Naturally.

881
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:15,133
No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.

882
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,970
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me,
but as has been pointed out...

883
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:23,975
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."

884
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:26,769
I instructed Harry
to form this organization.

885
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:30,398
And l, and l alone,
am responsible for its activities.

886
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,400
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.

887
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:35,111
If we hurry,
we should still make the morning edition.

888
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:40,074
Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you will escort Dumbledore...

889
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:41,659
...to Azkaban...

890
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:47,498
...to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.

891
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:51,169
Ah. l thought we might hit
this little snag.

892
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,798
You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to-

893
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:57,800
What was the phrase?

894
01:24:57,968 --> 01:24:59,552
- come quietly.

895
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,429
Well, l can tell you this:

896
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:04,182
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.

897
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,600
Enough of this.

898
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,185
Take him.

899
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:19,697
Whoa.

900
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:24,410
Well, you may not like him, minister...

901
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:26,704
...but you can't deny...

902
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:29,999
...Dumbledore has got style.

903
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:58,736
UMBRlDGE: Boys and girls cannot be
within eight inches of each other.

904
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:02,323
Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

905
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:07,537
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.

906
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:11,999
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

907
01:27:23,196 --> 01:27:24,822
Harry.

908
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:35,166
 You did everything you could.
No one could win against that old hag.

909
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:37,668
HERMlONE: Even Dumbledore
didn't see this coming.

910
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:40,755
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

911
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:43,007
Yeah, we talked you into it.

912
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:45,176
Yeah, but l agreed.

913
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:49,847
I tried so hard to help,
and all it's done is make things worse.

914
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:54,352
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

915
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:59,607
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

916
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:02,443
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

917
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:05,780
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?

918
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:09,951
To go it alone.

919
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:12,286
Psst.

920
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:17,959
Hagrid.

921
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:24,131
Any idea where he's taking us?

922
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:27,385
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

923
01:28:35,686 --> 01:28:38,354
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

924
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:41,065
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.

925
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:44,360
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

926
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:46,737
...they'll have a full uprising
on their hands.

927
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:48,572
Hagrid, what's going on?

928
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,950
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

929
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:56,080
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it,
but with Dumbledore gone...

930
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:59,917
...l'll likely be getting the sack
any day now.

931
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:03,587
And l just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

932
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:09,427
Grawpy.

933
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:13,931
Down here, you great buffoon.

934
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:21,939
Oh, Grawpy.

935
01:29:22,733 --> 01:29:24,442
Brought you some company.

936
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:39,040
I couldn't just leave him, because-

937
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,958
Because he's my brother.

938
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:42,251
Blimey.

939
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:44,462
Well, half brother, really.

940
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:49,884
He's completely harmless, just like l said.
Little high-spirited, is all.

941
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:54,513
 Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.

942
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:56,932
We talked about this.
You do not grab, do you?

943
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,351
That's your new friend, Hermione.

944
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:00,811
Grawpy.

945
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,317
HERMlONE:
Grawp.

946
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:11,447
Put me down.

947
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:16,660
Now.

948
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:29,924
You all right?

949
01:30:31,218 --> 01:30:32,885
Fine.

950
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:35,596
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

951
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:38,182
I think you've got an admirer.

952
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:42,853
You just stay away from her, all right?

953
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:15,719
He gets his own food and all.

954
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:20,057
It's company he'll be needing
when l'm gone.

955
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:23,602
You will look after him, won't you?

956
01:31:24,104 --> 01:31:26,814
I'm the only family he's got.

957
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:42,246
Feeling sentimental?

958
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:49,378
- That's private.
- Not to me.

959
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:53,174
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

960
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:58,762
Every memory he has access to
is a weapon he can use against you.

961
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:03,100
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

962
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:06,520
You're just like your father.

963
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:08,480
Lazy, arrogant.

964
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:10,900
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.

965
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:13,235
- l'm not weak.
- Then prove it.

966
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:15,779
Control your emotions.

967
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:18,908
Discipline your mind.

968
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:22,953
Legilimens.

969
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:31,253
Harry.

970
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,130
Sirius.

971
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:35,132
I may vomit.

972
01:32:35,425 --> 01:32:36,467
Stop it.

973
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:39,929
Is this what you call control?

974
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:43,474
We've been at it for hours.
If l could just rest.

975
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:47,061
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

976
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:52,024
You and Black, you're two of a kind.
Sentimental children forever whining...

977
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:54,735
...about how bitterly unfair
your lives have been.

978
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:58,280
Well, it may have escaped your notice,
but life isn't fair.

979
01:32:58,448 --> 01:33:02,409
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

980
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:05,621
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

981
01:33:06,665 --> 01:33:08,165
- Legilimens.
- Protego.

982
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:15,256
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

983
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:17,508
Snape. Expelliarmus.

984
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:19,510
Nice one, James.

985
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:22,179
- Dad.
Impedimenta.

986
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:24,348
ALL
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.

987
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:27,184
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?

988
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:29,603
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.

989
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:30,980
Enough.

990
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:34,525
Enough.

991
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:45,661
Your lessons are at an end.

992
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:46,954
I-

993
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:50,374
Get out.

994
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,768
 What's your name?
Michael.

995
01:34:09,936 --> 01:34:11,854
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.

996
01:34:12,022 --> 01:34:15,065
Yeah. lt's not as bad as it seems. See?

997
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:17,234
It's fading already.

998
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:22,156
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.

999
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:32,249
UMBRlDGE:
As l told you once before, Mr. Potter...

1000
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:36,211
...naughty children
deserve to be punished.

1001
01:34:39,257 --> 01:34:40,591
You know, George...

1002
01:34:40,759 --> 01:34:44,428
...l've always felt our futures lay outside
the world of academic achievement.

1003
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:49,183
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1004
01:36:01,131 --> 01:36:02,798
All right, professor!

1005
01:36:11,558 --> 01:36:13,350
Here you go.

1006
01:36:25,405 --> 01:36:26,864
Aah!

1007
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:40,127
Ready when you are.

1008
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:09,132
I need that prophecy.

1009
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:11,134
SlRlUS:
You'll have to kill me.

1010
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:16,557
Oh, l will.
But first, you will fetch it for me.

1011
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:18,433
- Crucio.
- Aah!

1012
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:23,313
- Crucio.
- Aahh!

1013
01:38:34,117 --> 01:38:35,576
Sirius.

1014
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:36,910
HERMlONE:
Harry, are you sure?

1015
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:39,371
I saw it. lt's just like with Mr. Weasley.

1016
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:41,415
It's the door I've been dreaming about.

1017
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:43,667
I couldn't remember
where l'd seen it before.

1018
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:45,752
Sirius said Voldemort
was after something.

1019
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:49,214
Something he didn't have the last time,
in the Department of Mysteries.

1020
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:51,341
Harry, please, just listen.

1021
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:54,845
What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?

1022
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:59,266
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

1023
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:02,936
What if he is?
I'm supposed to just let him die?

1024
01:39:03,104 --> 01:39:06,607
Hermione,
he's the only family l've got left.

1025
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:10,193
What do we do?

1026
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:13,196
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

1027
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:15,532
HERMlONE: Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.

1028
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:17,200
Not all of them.

1029
01:39:20,038 --> 01:39:21,371
Alohomora.

1030
01:39:32,592 --> 01:39:34,259
Alert the Order if you can.

1031
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:36,094
Are you mental? We're going with you.

1032
01:39:36,262 --> 01:39:38,055
It's too dangerous.

1033
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:41,850
When are you going to get it
into your head? We're in this together.

1034
01:39:42,018 --> 01:39:45,228
That you are.

1035
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:48,273
Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.

1036
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:55,405
You were going to Dumbledore,
weren't you?

1037
01:39:55,573 --> 01:39:57,574
- No.
- Liar.

1038
01:39:57,742 --> 01:40:00,577
 You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.

1039
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:04,247
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

1040
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:06,208
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1041
01:40:06,376 --> 01:40:09,252
I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.

1042
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:12,589
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1043
01:40:16,636 --> 01:40:18,095
Unless you wish to poison him-

1044
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:22,724
And l assure you, l would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1045
01:40:23,309 --> 01:40:25,268
- l cannot help you.

1046
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:29,398
He's got Padfoot.

1047
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:33,944
He's got Padfoot at the place
where it's hidden.

1048
01:40:34,404 --> 01:40:36,530
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1049
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:38,240
What is he talking about, Snape?

1050
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:46,915
No idea.

1051
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:52,963
Very well.

1052
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:56,299
You give me no choice, Potter.

1053
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:59,636
As this is an issue of Ministry security...

1054
01:40:59,804 --> 01:41:01,888
...you leave me with...

1055
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,599
...no alternative.

1056
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:07,602
The Cruciatus Curse
ought to loosen your tongue.

1057
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:09,229
That's illegal.

1058
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:12,315
What Cornelius doesn't know
won't hurt him.

1059
01:41:19,824 --> 01:41:21,324
Tell her, Harry!

1060
01:41:22,827 --> 01:41:24,286
Tell me what?

1061
01:41:25,496 --> 01:41:27,497
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

1062
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:29,916
...l will.

1063
01:41:31,544 --> 01:41:33,336
Where what is?

1064
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:36,840
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1065
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:43,388
How much further?

1066
01:41:43,556 --> 01:41:45,223
Not far.

1067
01:41:47,226 --> 01:41:50,937
It had to be somewhere
students wouldn't find it accidentally.

1068
01:41:55,276 --> 01:41:56,735
What are you doing?

1069
01:41:56,903 --> 01:41:58,695
Improvising.

1070
01:42:07,205 --> 01:42:08,830
UMBRlDGE:
Well?

1071
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:12,250
Where is this weapon?

1072
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:19,424
There isn't one, is there?

1073
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:24,387
You were trying to trick me.

1074
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:30,143
You know...

1075
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:33,563
...l really hate children.

1076
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:53,583
You have no business here, centaur.
This is a Ministry matter.

1077
01:42:56,254 --> 01:42:57,921
Lower your weapons.

1078
01:42:58,089 --> 01:43:03,635
I warn you, under the law,
as creatures of near-human intelligence...

1079
01:43:03,803 --> 01:43:05,053
Protego.

1080
01:43:05,304 --> 01:43:06,429
How dare you?

1081
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:08,598
Filthy half-breed.

1082
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:10,392
Incarcerous.

1083
01:43:23,614 --> 01:43:26,199
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1084
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:31,037
Now, enough. l will have order.

1085
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:42,465
UMBRlDGE:
You filthy animal.

1086
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:45,594
Do you know who l am?

1087
01:43:45,761 --> 01:43:48,597
Leave him alone. lt's not his fault.

1088
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:50,640
No, he doesn't understand.

1089
01:43:58,316 --> 01:44:01,776
Potter, do something.
Tell them l mean no harm.

1090
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:03,862
I'm sorry, professor.

1091
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:06,990
- But l must not tell lies.
- What are you doing?

1092
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:10,994
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1093
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:13,663
Let me go!

1094
01:44:16,334 --> 01:44:18,168
HERMlONE:
Thank you, Grawp.

1095
01:44:18,336 --> 01:44:21,838
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1096
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:33,683
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. lt wasn't pretty.

1097
01:44:33,851 --> 01:44:35,977
Told them l was hungry,
wanted some sweets.

1098
01:44:36,145 --> 01:44:38,688
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1099
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:41,024
That was clever, Ron.

1100
01:44:41,859 --> 01:44:44,361
- Has been known to happen.
- lt was brilliant.

1101
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:46,363
So how are we getting to London?

1102
01:44:47,698 --> 01:44:51,242
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1103
01:44:52,078 --> 01:44:54,788
...but l've got you
into enough trouble as it is.

1104
01:44:54,956 --> 01:44:57,916
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.

1105
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:00,377
Or was that all just words to you?

1106
01:45:02,254 --> 01:45:05,465
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.

1107
01:45:10,388 --> 01:45:12,555
So how are we going to get to London?

1108
01:45:13,933 --> 01:45:16,184
We fly, of course.

1109
01:46:07,236 --> 01:46:09,404
Department of Mysteries.

1110
01:46:18,247 --> 01:46:19,956
This is it.

1111
01:47:12,927 --> 01:47:15,261
Ninety-two. Ninety-three.

1112
01:47:16,972 --> 01:47:18,348
Ninety-four.

1113
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:20,642
Ninety-five.

1114
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:35,949
- He should be here.
Harry.

1115
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:39,953
It's got your name on it.

1116
01:48:05,146 --> 01:48:09,524
 The one with the power
to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.

1117
01:48:10,359 --> 01:48:12,777
And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal...

1118
01:48:12,945 --> 01:48:15,738
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.

1119
01:48:21,412 --> 01:48:26,749
For neither can live
while the other survives.

1120
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:30,378
HERMlONE:
Harry.

1121
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:42,348
Where's Sirius?

1122
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:47,604
 You know, you really should learn
to tell the difference between dreams...

1123
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:52,692
...and reality.

1124
01:48:53,944 --> 01:48:58,907
You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.

1125
01:48:59,617 --> 01:49:01,117
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1126
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:03,369
If you do anything to us, l'll break it.

1127
01:49:06,123 --> 01:49:08,708
He knows how to play.

1128
01:49:08,876 --> 01:49:12,670
Itty, bitty baby.

1129
01:49:12,838 --> 01:49:14,088
Potter.

1130
01:49:14,632 --> 01:49:16,507
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1131
01:49:16,675 --> 01:49:19,636
Neville Longbottom, is it?
How's Mum and Dad?

1132
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:21,638
Better, now they're about to be avenged.

1133
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:29,312
Now, let's everybody just calm down...

1134
01:49:29,772 --> 01:49:31,272
...shall we?

1135
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,900
All we want is that prophecy.

1136
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:36,110
Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?

1137
01:49:36,278 --> 01:49:38,071
LESTRANGE
You dare speak his name?

1138
01:49:39,615 --> 01:49:41,199
You filthy half-blood!

1139
01:49:41,367 --> 01:49:43,993
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?

1140
01:49:45,913 --> 01:49:51,376
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1141
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:54,295
Which is lucky for you, really.

1142
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:00,009
Haven't you always wondered...

1143
01:50:00,511 --> 01:50:05,682
...what was the reason for the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?

1144
01:50:06,433 --> 01:50:08,935
Why he was unable to kill you...

1145
01:50:09,103 --> 01:50:11,646
...when you were just an infant?

1146
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:17,819
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1147
01:50:18,737 --> 01:50:23,157
All the answers are there, Potter,
in your hand.

1148
01:50:24,368 --> 01:50:26,369
All you have to do...

1149
01:50:26,912 --> 01:50:28,871
...is give it to me.

1150
01:50:29,164 --> 01:50:32,458
Then l can show you everything.

1151
01:50:41,218 --> 01:50:43,011
I've waited 14 years.

1152
01:50:43,595 --> 01:50:44,887
I know.

1153
01:50:46,223 --> 01:50:49,142
I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now. Stupefy.

1154
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:50,727
Stupefy.

1155

Petrificus Totalus.

1157
01:51:16,628 --> 01:51:18,421
Well done, Neville.

1158
01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:28,431
Stupefy.

1159
01:51:30,184 --> 01:51:31,434
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

1160
01:51:42,571 --> 01:51:44,447
Stupefy.

1161
01:51:51,997 --> 01:51:54,290
Reducto.

1162
01:52:10,307 --> 01:52:12,433
Get back to the door.

1163
01:52:47,719 --> 01:52:52,223
Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn't they?

1165
01:52:57,438 --> 01:52:59,355
The voices.

1166
01:52:59,898 --> 01:53:01,941
Can you tell what they're saying?

1167
01:53:03,610 --> 01:53:05,778
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1168
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:08,281
Let's get out of here.

1169
01:53:08,449 --> 01:53:10,032
I hear them too.

1170
01:53:13,162 --> 01:53:15,788
HERMlONE:
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1171
01:53:18,542 --> 01:53:19,959
Please, Harry.

1172
01:53:20,711 --> 01:53:22,587
Get behind me.

1173
01:54:09,134 --> 01:54:11,844
Did you actually believe...

1174
01:54:12,012 --> 01:54:16,599
...or were you truly naive enough
to think...

1175
01:54:17,226 --> 01:54:22,355
...that children stood a chance
against us?

1176
01:54:25,859 --> 01:54:29,612
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1177
01:54:33,283 --> 01:54:36,619
Give me the prophecy now...

1178
01:54:36,787 --> 01:54:40,790
...or watch your friends die.

1179
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,137
- Don't give it to him, Harry.
- Shh!

1180
01:55:21,415 --> 01:55:24,166
Get away from my godson.

1181
01:55:54,281 --> 01:55:56,866
Now, listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.

1182
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:59,035
What? No, l'm staying with you.

1183
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:02,038
You've done beautifully.

1184
01:56:02,706 --> 01:56:04,332
Now, let me take it from here.

No. No.

1190
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:33,379
I killed Sirius Black. Ha-ha-ha!

1191
01:57:34,339 --> 01:57:36,298
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.

1192
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:51,814
You've got to mean it, Harry.

1193
01:57:51,982 --> 01:57:55,735
She killed him. She deserves it.

1194
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:02,783
You know the spell, Harry.

1195
01:58:14,337 --> 01:58:15,963
Do it.

Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

Harry?

You're the weak one...

...and you'll never know
love or friendship.

No, you don't.

It's my fault.

No, the fault is mine.

1228
02:04:50,191 --> 02:04:51,942
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1229
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:55,195
...before Voldemort made the connection
between you.

1230
02:04:55,989 --> 02:05:00,242
I thought by distancing myself from you,
as l have done all year...

1231
02:05:00,410 --> 02:05:05,664
...he'd be less tempted, and therefore
you might be more protected.

1232
02:05:08,459 --> 02:05:11,795
The prophecy said:

1233

"Neither one can live
while the other one survives."

1234
02:05:17,719 --> 02:05:23,765
It means one of us
is gonna have to kill the other, in the end.

1235
02:05:25,768 --> 02:05:27,352
Yes.

1236
02:05:27,812 --> 02:05:29,396
Why didn't you tell me?

1237
02:05:29,564 --> 02:05:33,150
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.

1238
02:05:33,318 --> 02:05:35,777
The same reason your friends saved you.

1239
02:05:36,613 --> 02:05:40,115
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

1240
02:05:40,283 --> 02:05:43,202
...l didn't want to cause you
any more pain.

1241
02:05:44,662 --> 02:05:46,788
I cared too much about you.

1242
02:06:11,648 --> 02:06:13,982
How come you're not at the feast?

1243
02:06:14,150 --> 02:06:18,695
Lost all my possessions.
Apparently people have been hiding them.

1244
02:06:18,863 --> 02:06:21,949
- That's awful.
- Oh, it's all good fun.

1245
02:06:22,116 --> 02:06:25,577
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

1246
02:06:25,745 --> 02:06:28,121
Do you want any help finding them?

1247
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,211
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1248
02:06:41,261 --> 02:06:43,345
Are you sure you don't want
any help looking?

1249
02:06:43,513 --> 02:06:45,180
That's all right.

1250
02:06:45,348 --> 02:06:47,516
Anyway, my mum always said...

1251
02:06:47,684 --> 02:06:51,520
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1252
02:06:54,774 --> 02:06:58,026
If not always in the way we expect.

1253
02:06:59,529 --> 02:07:02,239
Think l'll just go have some pudding.

1254
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:40,819
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.

1255
02:07:40,987 --> 02:07:42,696
What's that?

1256
02:07:43,281 --> 02:07:46,074
That even though
