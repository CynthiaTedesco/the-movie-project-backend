1
00:00:56,478 --> 00:00:59,077
Well, well,
Boris the Animal has a visitor.

2
00:00:59,355 --> 00:01:01,436
I guess one every 40 years is okay.

3
00:01:04,572 --> 00:01:05,761
It's a cake.

4
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:07,938
I decide what it is.

5
00:01:11,228 --> 00:01:13,309
Looks like some kind of cake.

6
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:16,474
She's clean.
Well, not clean, but you know...

7
00:01:53,052 --> 00:01:54,720
Oh, God.

8
00:02:02,297 --> 00:02:04,129
Boris the Animal...

9
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:06,085
you've got a visitor.

10
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,471
It's just Boris.

11
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:17,958
Your letters have been
soul-nourishing

12
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:18,850
tonic.

13
00:02:20,605 --> 00:02:23,520
And you are much more

14
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:28,028
unconventionally handsome
than your photos.

15
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:39,325
This ain't a conjugal visit.

16
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,802
So quit your conjugating...

17
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:45,089
When's the last time
you conjugated anything?

18
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:47,487
I see you've brought me a treat,
darling.

19
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:50,652
Would you mind cutting this up
for us? It's a special day.

20
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:53,347
I'm a romantic like that.

21
00:02:58,391 --> 00:02:59,811
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

22
00:02:59,964 --> 00:03:00,607
Why's that?

23
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,429
It'll ruin your figure.

24
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:46,947
You complete me.

25
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:06,876
The big one.

26
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,887
Boris!
You promised to take me with you!

27
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,067
We had a deal!

28
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,258
Obadiah Price.

29
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:23,736
Yes. I did make you a promise.

30
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:34,717
Wait. I smell something.

31
00:04:40,702 --> 00:04:42,140
You can't win, Boris.

32
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:44,030
Let's agree to disagree.

33
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,094
There's too many of us.

34
00:04:45,248 --> 00:04:48,834
Rather hot in here.
Mind if I open a window?

35
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,857
Sorry, darling.
We did love the cake.

36
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:35,070
Let's rewrite history, shall we, K?

37
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:55,843
Good afternoon.

38
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:58,595
Please give your attention
to my associate, Agent J.

39
00:05:58,748 --> 00:06:01,280
He's going to demonstrate
an electro-biomechanical,

40
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:03,966
neural-transmitting,
zero-synapse repositioner.

41
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,280
We call it the neuralyzer.

42
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,648
- Keep it simple, slick.
- Thanks a lot.

43
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:08,607
Thank you, Agent K.

44
00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:11,226
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
if you will look right here.

45
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:17,728
You know how you're on a plane and
you're asked to turn your phone off?

46
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:20,960
You're like, I ain't turning it off.
Has nothing to do with a plane.

47
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:23,425
Well, this is what we get.
That's what happens.

48
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:26,685
It gets up there, bounces around
on the satellites and blam!

49
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,201
Just turn your damn phone off.

50
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:31,519
Now you're gonna drive off a cliff
tonight because your GPS don't work.

51
00:06:32,823 --> 00:06:35,556
Check the composition of the
fuel units and surface deposits.

52
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,024
I wanna know who was driving.

53
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:38,568
Yes, sir.

54
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:40,831
- What are you gonna say tonight?
- Ah, don't worry.

55
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:42,759
No, I'm very worried.
This is important.

56
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,502
- I'm hungry. You hungry?
- K.

57
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,225
Seriously, I'm not
even sure that's meat.

58
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,592
I think I just saw a tooth in
that thing, or a claw, or a hoof.

59
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:53,184
Thanks, Manny.

60
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:55,744
That does not belong in a pita,
it belongs in a casket.

61
00:06:55,926 --> 00:06:58,046
What would go good with this
would be silence.

62
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,331
See, here's the problem.

63
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,607
You can't smell it

64
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,714
because your nose already
smells like that, but my nose doesn't.

65
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:07,742
Silence goes good with lot of things.
Ever try or is talking how you breathe?

66
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:10,466
Just say you hate me.
Don't take it out on the car.

67
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:11,971
Let me enjoy this.

68
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,659
Whoa, enjoyment.

69
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:17,093
So that's what enjoyment looks like
on that face. I like that emotion.

70
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:19,356
I keep emotion out of it.

71
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:21,916
Out of what, K? Life?

72
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:25,570
You don't wanna run it by me?

73
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:27,594
- Let me know what you'll say?
- Don't worry.

74
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,088
Oh, no, I'm worried.
Very worried.

75
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:32,552
It's the man's eulogy.
You have to show some feeling.

76
00:07:33,406 --> 00:07:36,129
That thing people do when they
change their facial expression?

77
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:39,237
I worked with Zed for 40 years.
A hell of an agent.

78
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,210
And I have written
a hell of a speech for him.

79
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:43,715
People will be moved.

80
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:52,069
<i>♪ Amazing grace ♪</i>

81
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:59,875
<i>♪ Was blind but now ♪</i>

82
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,985
<i>♪ I see ♪</i>

83
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,764
And now a few words from Agent K.

84
00:08:06,263 --> 00:08:09,025
I worked with Zed for over 40 years,
and in all that time

85
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:10,751
he never invited me to dinner.

86
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:14,529
He never asked me to his house
to watch a game.

87
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:18,596
He never shared a single detail
of his personal life.

88
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:20,926
Yeah, he was weird.

89
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:27,074
Thank you.

90
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:32,061
And now we will hear
from our new chief, Agent O.

91
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:34,439
Thank you, Agent K.
That was very moving.

92
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,594
- That was your eulogy?
- He was a good man.

93
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:40,769
Ladies, gentlemen,
other life forms.

94
00:08:41,143 --> 00:08:44,768
When I told the Finucian Zyglot
about Zed's passing,

95
00:08:44,921 --> 00:08:47,070
she said something
that I'm going to repeat.

96
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:49,218
And I'm paraphrasing.

97
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:13,789
That's just so Zed.

98
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:15,899
Thank you.

99
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,018
You lose something over here, Hondo?

100
00:09:29,181 --> 00:09:32,634
Can you promise, if I go first, you'll
do better than that at my funeral?

101
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:34,753
You know, something like, uh..

102
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,710
J was a friend.

103
00:09:36,863 --> 00:09:39,740
Now there's a big part of me
that's gone.

104
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:43,106
Oh, J, all the things
that I should have said,

105
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,447
except I was too old

106
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,326
and craggy and surly

107
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,666
and just tight. I was too

108
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,325
tight.

109
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:55,238
I'm gonna just miss
your caramel-brown skin.

110
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:57,022
I'll wing something.

111
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:02,115
<i>K, it's O.
We have reports of several humans</i>

112
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:05,375
<i>suffering from intestinal
worms of alien origin.</i>

113
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:06,843
Thank you, O.

114
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,046
How did you get to be like you?

115
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:11,906
Something happened, K.
What happened?

116
00:10:12,348 --> 00:10:14,084
You know how I live such a happy life?

117
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:16,989
How you live such a happy life?

118
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:19,972
I don't ask questions
I don't want to know the answer to.

119
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:22,178
Mm-mm. That's deep.

Jeffrey.

124
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:38,079
Do I know you?

125
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:42,567
Your services are legendary,
so said your father, Obadiah.

126
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:44,322
You were in Lunar-Max.

127
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:47,899
There is no prison that can hold me.

128
00:10:48,475 --> 00:10:51,333
Uh... Cool for you.
What do you need from me, man?

129
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:52,704
The device.

130
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:57,288
I'm going back in time
to kill a man before he takes my arm.

131
00:11:12,316 --> 00:11:13,985
Oh, K, J!

132
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,601
So happy to see you.
Uh, Mr. Wu get you your regular table?

133
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:25,820
You no hungry?

134
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:27,038
Show us the tanks, Wu.

135
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:30,299
Oh, sure, sure. You look.
Very fresh.

136
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,159
Show us the tanks in the back.

137
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:35,487
So sorry. No speak English.
You come back later, okay?

138
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,827
Save the chop-socky bullshit
for the tourists, Wu.

139
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:43,361
Hey, what you guys
wanna bust my balls for, huh?

140
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:44,991
You don't have no balls.

141
00:11:47,293 --> 00:11:48,002
Ooh.

142
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:50,947
Man, you look like
you come from the planet.

143
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:52,155
Damn.

144
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,030
And Bob here is a clear violation
of Health Ordinance 32:

145
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:59,425
Selling unlicensed extraterrestrial...

146
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:02,877
foodstuffs.

147
00:12:03,031 --> 00:12:04,392
That is an Earth fish.

148
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,943
Very traditional in China.
You arrest me,

149
00:12:07,097 --> 00:12:08,123
that's a hate crime!

150
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:09,245
It would be

151
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,904
if you were Chinese.

152
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,407
K, come on.
I got larvae to feed.

153
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,611
Who is the Spiky Bulba fol?

154
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:17,637
Nobody.

155
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,749
Who's it for?

156
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:19,871
I keep them in case!

157
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:21,348
- In case what?
- I don't know!

158
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:22,403
Anybody!

159
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:23,813
All right, you slug.

160
00:12:24,762 --> 00:12:25,501
Whoa, whoa. Uh...

161
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:27,716
Wu,

162
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,322
uh, he and I are having issues right now,
but you shouldn't suffer for that.

163
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:32,157
Thank you, J.

164
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,331
So if you don't like getting
fish-slapped, keep to our agreement.

165
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:37,978
Earth people get Earth fish.
Real Earth fish.

166
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,440
On behalf of my pathetic self
and worthless children, you stay.

167
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,989
Allow me most honorable benefit
of serving you favourite noodles, K?

168
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:46,945
Don't nobody want
your nasty-ass noodles.

169
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,767
You're a piece of shit, Wu.

170
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:50,052
Shrimp and bok choy.

171
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,642
We're gonna be here for a while.

172
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,447
That was just mean.

173
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:10,911
What you did to Wu back there.

174
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,789
Snatched his skirt off.

175
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:15,870
That's just disrespectful.

176
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:17,788
I used to play a game with my dad:

177
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,540
What'll You Have For Your Last Meal.

178
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,072
You could do worse than this.

179
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,438
Oh. Okay. Um...

180
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:29,248
I played a game with my dad

181
00:13:29,402 --> 00:13:30,399
called catch.

182
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:32,960
Except I'd throw the ball
and it'd just hit the wall

183
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,408
because he wasn't there.

184
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,345
Don't badmouth your old man.

185
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,009
I'm not badmouthing him.
I just didn't really know him.

186
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:41,630
It's not right.

187
00:13:41,783 --> 00:13:43,739
Damn right it's not.
A boy needs a father.

188
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:46,051
Table one hasn't ordered a thing.
Table three

189
00:13:46,204 --> 00:13:47,873
just drank his fourth cup

190
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:49,311
of duck sauce.

191
00:13:53,311 --> 00:13:54,462

205
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:17,785
This is a very confusing time

206
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:19,205
in my life.

207
00:14:38,107 --> 00:14:39,134
Hey.

208
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:55,648
Keep your mouth closed,
keep your head down.

209
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:20,677
Hello, K.

210
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:24,772
Boris the Animal.

211
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:27,390
It's just Boris.

212
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:31,485
You haven't changed very much.
I see the arm I shot off is still shot off.

213
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,960
Yes, my arm.

214
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:38,362
We've thought about that moment

215
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,961
every day for the last 40 years.

216
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:43,071
Well, that's just not living a full life.

217
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:45,823
I can promise you
it will be longer than yours.

218
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:49,573
Lonelier too. Since you're
the last Boglodite standing.

219
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:51,491
We'll see about that.

220
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:55,231
But first,
I want the pleasure of killing you.

221
00:16:55,385 --> 00:16:56,478
Yo, K.

222
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:00,151
- Where the hell have you been?
- Fishing.

223
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:20,550
You don't know it, K,
but you're already dead.

224
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,359
You all right?

225
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:40,229
May I have everyone's attention,
please?

226
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:45,255
Thank you.

227
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,352
You know how your kid won
the goldfish in that little baggie

228
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:51,009
from the fair and you didn't
want it in your house

229
00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:54,471
so you told your kid it ran away
when you flushed it down the toilet?

230
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,063
Well, this is what happens.

231
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:59,333
Okay? See what I'm talking about?
Don't lie in your kids.

232
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:07,840
Man, I am getting too old for this.

233
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:10,247
I can only imagine how you feel.

234
00:18:10,391 --> 00:18:12,386
Boris the Animal.

235
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,810
I put him away a long time ago.
It's the worst mistake I ever made.

236
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:17,958
Why? Was he innocent?

237
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:19,972
Should have killed him.

238
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,971
- Well, shit, let's go get him.
- No.

239
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:25,822
- No?
- Leave it alone.

240
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:27,165
It's above your pay grade.

241
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,997
We have the same pay grade.

242
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,970
It has nothing to do with you.
Mind your own business.

243
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:35,911
Okay, first of all, let's get a little bit
of that bass out your voice.

244
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:39,489
Secondly, as long as Spikey Boy is
running around, this is my business.

245
00:18:39,642 --> 00:18:41,924
You forget about Boris
or my report will reﬂect

246
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:43,996
that your conduct has been unbecoming.

247
00:18:44,476 --> 00:18:47,353
Well, maybe my report
is gonna reﬂect some shit too, K.

248
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:49,913
- You are suspended for two weeks.
- Bullshit.

249
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:51,975
Four weeks.

250
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:54,114
How about I quit?

251
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,454
There are things out there
you don't need to know.

252
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:59,513
That's not the lie you told me
when you recruited me.

253
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:10,044
What up, Pops?

254
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,767
Yeah. Lose your partner?

Don't ask questions you don't
want to know the answer to.

00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,323
He didn't say please.

323
00:24:40,702 --> 00:24:43,099
- K get in yet?
- Who?

324
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:44,135
You new?

325
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,849
Very funny, Agent J.

326
00:24:54,617 --> 00:24:57,312
J, everything you told me
yesterday, you were right as rain.

327
00:24:57,466 --> 00:24:59,969
- Thank God for that 10-hour stakeout.
- Who are you?

328
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:02,721
Exactly. I feel like
a whole new man today.

329
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:06,529
Like this great weight has been lifted.
I've had anger issues my entire life,

330
00:25:06,682 --> 00:25:09,147
but now I see I was mad at myself.
And my stepmom.

331
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,228
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to stop talking.

332
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:13,606
It's like I closed
this emotional window.

333
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,707
But I threw a brick
through that window.

334
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,663
Thank you for handing me
that brick, J.

335
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:21,375
Whoever you are, give me five feet
or I'll pluck you in your throat.

336
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:25,316
I'm gonna go
to the little Men's-in-Black room,

337
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:28,865
then we'll go find those morons
from Pox Elhera. Lunch is on me.

338
00:25:30,553 --> 00:25:31,646
Who was that?

339
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,600
Double A? Your partner.

340
00:25:37,017 --> 00:25:39,481
Uh, I need you to go get me some
chocolate milk, all right?

341
00:25:39,644 --> 00:25:42,205
Just a really big glass.
Have you seen K?

342
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:43,835
Did he call in sick or anything?

343
00:25:43,998 --> 00:25:45,418
Who's K?

344
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:48,679
All right, alright,
go ahead, go ahead.

345
00:25:48,832 --> 00:25:49,570
K!

346
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:51,872
All right.

347
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,474
You got me.

348
00:25:53,627 --> 00:25:55,814
I'll give it to you.
It's funny, very elaborate.

349
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:59,007
Oh, and all of you,
fantastic performances.

350
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:01,760
You waited 14 years
to develop a sense of humor,

351
00:26:01,913 --> 00:26:03,553
but this is a good one.

352
00:26:03,707 --> 00:26:05,471
But, K, I need you
to come out here now

353
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:07,974
because I'm starting
to get a little pissed off.

354
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:10,305
Agent J, would you mind
keeping your voice down

355
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,290
and telling me who you're looking for?

356
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:13,499
I'm looking for K.

357
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:15,273
Who is K?

358
00:26:16,472 --> 00:26:18,591
You too? You too.

359
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,643
I mean, who is he to you?

360
00:26:20,797 --> 00:26:21,890
My partner.

361
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,451
Older gentleman, 110,

362
00:26:24,604 --> 00:26:25,592
maybe 111 years old.

363
00:26:25,755 --> 00:26:30,521
Sort of a surly, Elvis thing happening
with him. He smiles like this.

364
00:26:31,452 --> 00:26:32,708
Seen him around?

365
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:36,544
I'll take you to K.

366
00:26:36,726 --> 00:26:38,462
Thank you.

367
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:46,921
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's K.

368
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,089
He's been dead for over 40 years.

369
00:26:49,913 --> 00:26:53,471
Okay, see, the prerequisite for a joke
is that it be funny.

370
00:26:54,008 --> 00:26:55,332
It's never been funny.

371
00:27:00,664 --> 00:27:03,647
Computer, Agent K
and Boris the Animal.

372
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,399
<i>Men in Black incident report,
July, 1969.</i>

373
00:27:06,553 --> 00:27:07,675
Location, Cape Canaveral.

374
00:27:07,838 --> 00:27:10,120
Perpetrator Boris the Animal
escaped and fled Earth.

375
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:13,410
Assumed to have returned to planet
Boglodotia 20 light-years away.

376
00:27:13,563 --> 00:27:16,766
Agent K pronounced dead at scene.
Awarded posthumous commendation

377
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,720
for action which prevented
greater loss of human life.

378
00:27:19,864 --> 00:27:21,312
That's not what happened.

379
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:23,365
I looked at this report.
K put Boris away...

380
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:26,376
- Agent K is dead
- Well, I just talked to him last night.

381
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,872
- You are imagining.
- I'm not.

382
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:29,924
- I need a psych team up here.
- Yes, ma'am.

383
00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:33,761
Aqua Velva aftershave.
I didn't imagine that.

384
00:27:33,914 --> 00:27:38,268
Every stakeout,
endless hours of cowboy music.

385
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:41,251
Every morning with his coffee,
he'd say:

386
00:27:41,404 --> 00:27:44,032
I tell you something, slick.
This coffee tastes like dirt.

387
00:27:44,185 --> 00:27:46,305
And I was supposed
to say, What do you expect?

388
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,194
It was ground this morning.

389
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:49,978
How do you know that?

390
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:51,493
Chocolate milk, sir?

391
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:55,003
Where you been, man?
It was like an hour ago.

392
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,248
Wait.

393
00:27:57,401 --> 00:28:00,163
How long have you been craving
chocolatized dairy products?

394
00:28:00,316 --> 00:28:01,640
Just today.

395
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:04,316
Are you experiencing headaches?
Dizziness?

396
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:05,917
Loss of balance?

397
00:28:06,071 --> 00:28:07,519
Agitation? Depression?

398
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:08,794
Hell, yeah.

399
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:12,381
Two possibilities.
One is you've been bitten

400
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:13,983
by a Hovartian brain tick

401
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:16,515
and could die in horrible agony
at any moment.

402
00:28:18,078 --> 00:28:20,773
Damn it. It's not the tick.

403
00:28:20,926 --> 00:28:22,787
Damn it, it's not the tick?

404
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,542
It's something worse than the tick?

405
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:29,021
Your obsession
with chocolate milk indicates

406
00:28:29,184 --> 00:28:31,677
that you might be involved
in some sort of temporal fracture.

407
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:33,605
I don't know
what you're talking about.

408
00:28:33,758 --> 00:28:36,070
Chocolate milk relieves
temporal-fracture headaches.

409
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:37,825
What's a temporal fracture?

410
00:28:37,978 --> 00:28:38,937
A break in the timeline.

411
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:40,040
Don't know what you mean.

412
00:28:40,184 --> 00:28:41,958
Time travel! Time travel.

413
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,231
There's no such thing as time travel.

414
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:45,986
- Well, there is.
- No.

415
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:47,194
There's not.

416
00:28:47,357 --> 00:28:48,738
Because if there were

417
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:51,750
class-one senior agent
such myself

418
00:28:51,903 --> 00:28:54,368
would have been aware of it,
wouldn't he have?

419
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:56,957
Were it not classified
and way above his pay grade.

420
00:28:58,108 --> 00:28:59,230
You know, I need a raise.

421
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:01,887
There was one man, scumbag,
Obadiah Price,

422
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,956
he figured it out, we busted him,
we made time travel illegal

423
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:08,514
throughout the universe
and he is serving life on Lunar-Max.

424
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:11,324
No... That's where Boris
was locked up.

425
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:15,390
If Boris worked out
how to time jump,

426
00:29:15,544 --> 00:29:18,143
he could seriously change
the course of history.

427
00:29:19,581 --> 00:29:21,413
<i>Attention.
Early-warning system engaged.</i>

428
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:24,386
<i>Inbound hostile warships
entering solar system.</i>

429
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:26,525
<i>Boglodite markings
and language detected.</i>

430
00:29:26,688 --> 00:29:29,987
Boglodite. Boris is a Boglodite,
but they're extinct.

431
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,397
Apparently not.

432
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,408
<i>Catastrophic Earth attack imminent.</i>

433
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:36,192
Put up the Arc Net.

434
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,944
- The what?
- The Arc Net. The defense system.

435
00:29:39,126 --> 00:29:40,699
K got it for the Boglodites.

436
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:43,356
There is no K.

437
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,734
He's been dead for over 40 years.

438
00:29:45,888 --> 00:29:49,340
No K. No defense system.

439
00:29:49,724 --> 00:29:51,201
Boris jumped back and killed him.

440
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:54,145
If you wanna save the world,
stop that from happening.

441
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:56,898
You have to find Jeffrey Price.
He's Obadiah's son.

442
00:29:57,147 --> 00:29:59,429
Let's hope the little squirt
hasn't skipped town.

443
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:06,210
- Good luck, J!
- This planet's toast.

444
00:30:21,468 --> 00:30:23,751
How can I help you?
We're having an amazing sale

445
00:30:23,895 --> 00:30:24,547
on batteries.

446
00:30:24,729 --> 00:30:27,232
Okay, we got other stuff,
like headphones, adapters or...

447
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:29,284
You helped Boris the Animal time jump.

448
00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:31,433
Okay, I had to. That dude's a freak.

449
00:30:31,576 --> 00:30:32,535
He killed my partner.

450
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:35,010
I want to know when
and where you sent him.

451
00:30:35,163 --> 00:30:37,407
What, you think I keep,
like, a logbook?

452
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:44,677
Target vector, July 16,

453
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,691
- 1969.
- All right.

454
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:48,513
That's a real bummer about your buddy.

455
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,086
I'm sure he was a great guy.

456
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:52,186
But in terms of
the space-time continuum,

457
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:54,881
your friend was a little blip
on the historical radar!

458
00:30:59,552 --> 00:31:01,451
That's a big blip.

459
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:04,510
- Okay. What's the plan?
- You're gonna send me

460
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:06,533
back to July 15th, 1969.

461
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:09,343
No, that's a stupid plan,
because I sent Boris to July 16th.

462
00:31:09,497 --> 00:31:12,297
I'm not worried about that one.
I'll kill the younger Boris

463
00:31:12,441 --> 00:31:13,832
before the older one shows.

464
00:31:13,976 --> 00:31:16,354
That way, neither of them
will even exist.

465
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,231
That's why you get to wear
the black suit.

466
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:20,603
No?

467
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:22,780
You're gonna leave me hanging?
Okay.

468
00:31:22,943 --> 00:31:25,340
Oh, I just thought of something
Even back then,

469
00:31:25,503 --> 00:31:27,517
New York was like a big-ish city.

470
00:31:27,671 --> 00:31:29,512
So how are you gonna really find him?

471
00:31:29,656 --> 00:31:33,943
On July 15th, Boris killed an alien,
Roman the Fabulist, at Coney Island.

472
00:31:34,106 --> 00:31:36,187
You're gonna get there first
and be waiting?

473
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,402
Dude, they should give you
two black suits.

474
00:31:38,556 --> 00:31:39,745
My man, for real?

475
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:40,771
On, right.

476
00:31:40,925 --> 00:31:42,114
Sorry. Um...

477
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,195
This...

478
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:46,689
is the real deal. Time-jump gear.

479
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,482
Very rare, very old.

480
00:31:48,635 --> 00:31:50,716
But first, we gotta get high.

481
00:31:50,937 --> 00:31:52,193
Hey. No.

482
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:54,917
No. No, I mean, really high.

483
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:18,778
Hey, man?
A little help here?

484
00:32:20,696 --> 00:32:22,681
Thank you.

485
00:32:22,844 --> 00:32:23,679
Okay...

486
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:27,678
- You know the rules of time jumps?
- Give me the short version.

487
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:30,526
Okay. You wanna save
your partner, word of advice:

488
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,157
Stay away from him.

489
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,717
Yeah, got it. Stay away from K.
Just kill Boris.

490
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:36,645
Now, take these.

491
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:38,467
It gets pretty windy on the way down.

492
00:32:39,676 --> 00:32:40,769
The way down?

493
00:32:40,922 --> 00:32:43,166
With eyes tearing up,
it's hard to read the dial.

494
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,600
Plus, it helps you look like a real
time traveler, which is cool.

495
00:32:46,744 --> 00:32:48,767
I am not jumping off of this building!

496
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:50,724
Time jump...

497
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:52,671
Okay, now,

498
00:32:52,824 --> 00:32:54,560
I gotta set this thing

499
00:32:54,713 --> 00:32:56,219
to the 15th.

500
00:32:56,957 --> 00:32:58,377
Uh, that seems

501
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:00,439
right-ish.

502
00:33:01,753 --> 00:33:02,395
Now

503
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:04,937
all you gotta do is jump.

504
00:33:05,081 --> 00:33:07,392
Hey. Hey. Stop. Stop it.

505
00:33:07,545 --> 00:33:09,185
When you're moving fast enough,

506
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:12,762
that circle is gonna fill up with
some sort of green time-travel liquid

507
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:14,594
and it's gonna glow really bright.

508
00:33:14,748 --> 00:33:17,280
As soon as that happens,
break that blue laser line

509
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:19,332
with your thumb
to complete the circuit.

510
00:33:19,485 --> 00:33:21,432
At this height, that should be, uh...

511
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:24,386
Let's see, mass of Earth and
30-something feet per minute...

512
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,918
It's 32 feet per second, per second!

513
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,970
That sounds right-ish.

514
00:33:29,114 --> 00:33:33,286
So that would be, I guess, uh,
about two feet off the ground.

515
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:34,686
I break the laser line?

516
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,799
No, don't break it!

517
00:33:35,962 --> 00:33:37,832
- No, when I'm fast enough!
- Sounds good!

518
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:40,805
Do I break the laser line
or do I not break the laser line?

519
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:42,876
Do not lose that time device

520
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,847
or you will be stuck in 1969!

521
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,733
It wasn't the best time
for your people.

522
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:53,752
I'm just saying.
It's, like, a lot cooler now.

523
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:55,392
How will I know if it works?

524
00:33:55,545 --> 00:33:57,319
You'll either know

525
00:33:58,231 --> 00:33:59,707
or you won't.

526
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:07,744
You must really love this guy
to do this.

527
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:10,842
Oh, wait. How come I remember K,
but nobody else does?

528
00:34:13,882 --> 00:34:16,347
- That means you were there!
- I was where?

529
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:19,368
If you survive, you gotta come back
and tell me everything.

530
00:34:19,512 --> 00:34:20,154
Where was I?

531
00:34:21,756 --> 00:34:22,715
You gotta go!

532
00:34:22,907 --> 00:34:23,645
Just go, go, go!

533
00:34:47,803 --> 00:34:48,858
Oh, no!

534
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:05,891
Come on!

535

00:37:11,516 --> 00:37:12,935
Okay, we're here.

- Yeah, yeah.

Hey. Hey, do me a favour, all right?

550
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:25,029
- Be careful with the luggage.
- Absolutely, sir.

551
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:28,232
I paid a lot of
money for that luggage.

552
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:30,840
- We'll take good care.

Yeah, it'll be in your room, sir.
Just go in.

556
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:41,956
Excuse me.
Excuse me, who is that?

00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:42,982

If you want to keep that, I wouldn't.

00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,690
Make love, not war.

568
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:17,085
I prefer to do both.

569
00:38:51,323 --> 00:38:53,280
How are you, officers?
What can I do you for?

570
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:56,416
Well, look at this.
Power windows, power seats

571
00:38:56,895 --> 00:38:58,593
- I'll bet you it cost 6 grand.
- Yeah.

572
00:38:58,746 --> 00:39:01,959
Uh, yes, and it has a roof,
but it's hidden.

573
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:03,906
Hey, what kind of work do you do?

574
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:05,315
An individual of your

575
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:08,298
particular ethnic persuasion?

576
00:39:08,797 --> 00:39:11,194
Maybe he's a noted athlete.

577
00:39:12,796 --> 00:39:17,409
Yes. Uh... Starling forward
for the Detroit Darkies.

578
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:19,711
Where'd you get the car?
And the suit?

579
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:22,463
I stole them both.
Uh, car from your wife,

580
00:39:22,617 --> 00:39:24,391
suit from your grandmother.

581
00:39:26,175 --> 00:39:26,779
Hey.

582
00:39:26,942 --> 00:39:28,706
What do we have here?
Concealed weapon?

583
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,529
Hey, it's his grandmother's suit.

584
00:39:30,874 --> 00:39:32,610
Hey, what's this?
Probably drugs.

585
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:34,950
I have rights
and I demand to see my lawyer

586
00:39:35,103 --> 00:39:37,923
before you press that small button
on the side firmly.

587
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:38,719
Press it.

588
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:46,717
That, gentlemen,
is a standard-issue neuralyzer.

589
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:48,290
You're not gonna remember that.

590
00:39:48,444 --> 00:39:51,071
And just because you see
a black man driving a nice car

591
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:53,440
does not mean it's stolen.

592
00:39:56,154 --> 00:39:59,712
I stole that one.
But not because I'm black.

593
00:40:02,551 --> 00:40:04,229
I'll be done with the car in a minute!

594
00:40:04,383 --> 00:40:07,835
Just find it and take it back
to the jerk at the Roosevelt Hotel.

595
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:23,976
Where is the Archanan?

596
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,146
You are too late.

597
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:27,870
He is going to give the humans

598
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:28,675
the Arc Net.

599
00:40:30,718 --> 00:40:32,636
Let's agree to disagree.

600
00:41:02,175 --> 00:41:03,421
We'll take it from here.

601
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:05,157
K?

602
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:08,667
K! K! Aah!

603
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:25,892
Dad, I'm on Earth.

604
00:41:26,045 --> 00:41:27,618
I need bail.

605

607
00:41:44,957 --> 00:41:49,311
You need to turn the electricity
down on that damn thing.

608
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,556
Can't taste my fricking tongue, K.

609
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:52,802
How do you know my name?

610
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:56,965
What? Because I called you 'K'?

611
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,170
No, I call everybody K.

612
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:00,993
It's kind of my thing.

613
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:02,268
What up, K?

614
00:42:02,527 --> 00:42:03,678
All right, I sort of...

615
00:42:05,433 --> 00:42:08,866
Yeah, that's kind of my thing.
I just... Uh, some people like it.

616
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,072
Most people.

617
00:42:11,293 --> 00:42:12,798
Now that I know what you look like

618
00:42:12,952 --> 00:42:14,525
when you're lying, show me

619
00:42:14,688 --> 00:42:16,961
what you look like
when you're telling the truth?

620
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:20,193
I won those at Coney Island
on the ring toss.

621
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,696
I won a stuffed bear once,
but never one of these.

622
00:42:22,935 --> 00:42:24,643
Must be good, slick.

623
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,385
All right, sir,
I was minding my own business.

624
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:29,630
I was waiting for my girl,
who, by the way.

625
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:32,315
Is probably worried sick
looking for me right now.

626
00:42:32,478 --> 00:42:35,355
So I just need my things
and I need to get back to her.

627
00:42:35,518 --> 00:42:36,391
What's her name?

628
00:42:37,887 --> 00:42:39,134
Your gal, what's her name?

629
00:42:39,863 --> 00:42:41,915
Schtaron.

630
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,636
Schtaron?

631
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,100
I bet Schtaron
likes that suit of yours. Hm?

632
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:54,785
What, it's a crime
to wear a black suit?

633
00:42:55,035 --> 00:42:57,729
All right, listen.
I haven't done anything wrong.

634
00:42:57,912 --> 00:43:00,233
And I need to get out of here.
I cannot be here with you.

635
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:04,385
Terribly sorry. X is frightfully upset
about the whole Coney Island incident.

636
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:06,016
Thanks for the heads-up.

637
00:43:07,512 --> 00:43:10,207
Oh, man, this coffee tastes like dirt.

638
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,997
- What do you expect? It was...
- Just ground this morning.

639
00:43:13,918 --> 00:43:14,695
O?

640
00:43:18,713 --> 00:43:20,612
No, I call ladies "O".

641
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:23,681
To me, O is feminine, K is masculine.

642
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:28,160
You know, I see a couple,
I'm like, "O-K".

643
00:43:28,313 --> 00:43:30,596
What a mess.
Any casualties?

644
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:32,610
Yes, Roman the Fabulist.

645
00:43:32,763 --> 00:43:34,911
Any human casualties?

646
00:43:35,516 --> 00:43:37,117
No, sir.

647
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:39,333
Who the hell is this?

648
00:43:39,707 --> 00:43:40,829
Look, I was...

649
00:43:40,992 --> 00:43:43,869
Stray human caught in the net.
Code 43 him and throw him back.

650
00:43:44,032 --> 00:43:46,046
You're late for a meeting
with the Viagrans.

651
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:48,223
They have a revolutionary new pill.

652
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,499
It's really...

653
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,289
Okay, slick.

654
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:56,068
I was waiting for my girl.

655
00:43:56,221 --> 00:43:57,248
Schtaron.

656
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,971
Yes, she's Greek.

657
00:44:01,112 --> 00:44:05,246
Okay. Just one last thing,
an eye exam...

658
00:44:10,396 --> 00:44:13,120
That's not an eye exam, K.
That's a big-ass neuralyzer!

659
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:16,323
You have a lot of information for
a fella who doesn't know anything.

660
00:44:16,476 --> 00:44:17,829
I see what you're saying.

661
00:44:18,011 --> 00:44:20,226
Whoa. You know, K,
we need to hold up a second.

662
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:21,569
K!

663
00:44:22,394 --> 00:44:23,995
Let's get this bite guard in here.

664
00:44:24,158 --> 00:44:25,827
Hey. Back up. Back up.

665
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,606
K, listen, I think we got off
on the wrong foot, all right?

666
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:32,003
So let's just stop for a second
and talk.

667
00:44:32,157 --> 00:44:33,797
Don't put me in here, K!

668
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:35,072
Too late, hoss.

669
00:44:35,226 --> 00:44:38,112
K, no, listen to me.
I can help you with this case!

670
00:44:39,033 --> 00:44:40,328
K!

671
00:44:41,594 --> 00:44:43,713
I'm doing the truth face!
You're missing it!

672
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,631
Ah, I'll just use my imagination.

673
00:44:48,959 --> 00:44:49,889
K, the killer

674
00:44:50,043 --> 00:44:52,642
you're looking for, I'm after
the same guy, a Boglodite.

675
00:44:52,795 --> 00:44:53,793
His name is Boris.

676
00:44:53,946 --> 00:44:55,039
Ship has sailed, amigo.

677
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,900
If we don't get him, there'll be two.

678
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,885
You had my undivided attention.

679
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:00,122
One will have one arm

680
00:45:00,285 --> 00:45:01,916
and one's gonna have two, K!

681
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,364
Listen to me!

682
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:04,457
If you erase me.

683
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:05,790
You erase the world!

684
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,224
Fifteen seconds

685
00:45:09,272 --> 00:45:11,228
to neuralyzation. Fourteen.

686
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,568
Thirteen. Twelve.

687
00:45:13,721 --> 00:45:16,512
Eleven. Ten. Nine.

688
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:21,413
When you see Boris tomorrow, K,
kill him. Do not arrest him, kill him!

689
00:45:21,758 --> 00:45:24,482
Four. Three. Two.

690
00:45:30,879 --> 00:45:34,466
Is this thing off?
Hey, I don't think it's all the way off, K!

691
00:45:34,935 --> 00:45:36,863
It's whirring and buzzing.

692
00:45:37,688 --> 00:45:39,875
I don't know if I don't know nothing.

693
00:45:43,672 --> 00:45:45,025
I knew Roman.

694
00:45:45,303 --> 00:45:47,969
His wife cooked me dinner once.
While it was not pleasant,

695
00:45:48,122 --> 00:45:49,561
he was my friend.

696
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,611
Last chance, who are you
and what do you know?

697
00:45:57,598 --> 00:45:58,537
I'm an agent at Men in Black

698
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:00,225
but I'm from the future.
We're partners.

699
00:46:00,379 --> 00:46:01,980
In 25 years, you'll recruit me,

700
00:46:02,172 --> 00:46:05,116
and 14 years after that,
the guy you didn't let me kill today

701
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,198
escapes from prison, jumps to the past

702
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:10,880
and unleashes an invasion of Earth.
We got about 19 hours to kill him,

703
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,933
so, really, we need to go right now.

704
00:46:21,276 --> 00:46:21,948
All right.

705
00:46:27,424 --> 00:46:29,121
So that's the story you believe.

706
00:46:29,275 --> 00:46:30,272
That one was the truth.

707
00:46:30,426 --> 00:46:32,449
Wasn't the whole truth,
but it'll do for now.

708
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:35,585
What are you talking about?
Of course it's the whole truth.

709
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:38,846
The problem with a lie is once
you start lying you put yourself...

710
00:46:42,615 --> 00:46:44,159
Agent K.

711
00:46:44,696 --> 00:46:45,952
What's he still doing here?

712
00:46:46,135 --> 00:46:48,830
I might have cooked him too long.
Thought I'd walk him out.

713
00:46:48,983 --> 00:46:50,757
I put my pants on.

714
00:46:56,224 --> 00:46:57,662
Okay, future man, where to?

715
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:00,156
I don't know.

716
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,278
What do you mean?

717
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:07,080
I don't know. Uh...
Go wherever you went last time.

718
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,574
I haven't been here.
I didn't tell you where I went?

719
00:47:09,756 --> 00:47:12,997
No. I mean, we don't really talk.

720
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,160
What kind of partners sit in a car
every day for 14 years and don't talk?

721
00:47:17,754 --> 00:47:21,725
Exactly. And this is the type
of problem it causes.

722
00:47:21,888 --> 00:47:22,876
It's dysfunctional.

723
00:47:23,096 --> 00:47:27,038
All right, sport, you better get useful
real quick or you go back in room 43.

724
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:29,637
Man...

725
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:32,706
Uh... The, uh...

726
00:47:32,955 --> 00:47:35,679
There was something in the file
about a factory.

727
00:47:35,832 --> 00:47:37,923
Something happened at a factory.

728
00:47:39,831 --> 00:47:43,524
Hey, look, man, you can put
your Jedi Knight on me all you want.

729
00:47:43,677 --> 00:47:44,895
That's all I got.

730
00:47:49,978 --> 00:47:51,043
That spark something?

731
00:47:51,225 --> 00:47:53,795
Roman had this on his person
when he was murdered.

732
00:47:55,387 --> 00:47:56,826
It's a matchbook.

733
00:47:57,017 --> 00:47:58,820
No, it's a clue.

734
00:47:59,003 --> 00:48:00,537
He didn't smoke.

735
00:48:15,997 --> 00:48:18,308
<i>♪ I'm an old cowhand ♪</i>

736
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,322
<i>♪ From the Rio Grande ♪</i>

737
00:48:20,476 --> 00:48:23,650
<i>♪ And I sing this song
in the cowboy band ♪</i>

738
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:27,841
<i>♪ I know all the songs
that the cowboys know about ♪</i>

739
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:30,852
You lose something over here, Hondo?

740
00:48:31,198 --> 00:48:32,511
No. Uh...

741
00:48:32,665 --> 00:48:35,101
Hey, man, how old are you?

742
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:37,240
<i>♪ He's an old cowhand ♪</i>

743
00:48:37,403 --> 00:48:38,429
Twenty-nine.

744
00:48:38,688 --> 00:48:40,769
You got some city miles on you.

745
00:48:41,526 --> 00:48:44,394
I'm starting to understand
why we don't talk.

746
00:48:51,002 --> 00:48:53,601
- How well do you know this place?
- I know its reputation.

747
00:48:54,042 --> 00:48:57,571
I don't like it. I hate going in blind.
I'm gonna need my gun.

748
00:48:58,204 --> 00:48:59,873
Sure thing, slick.

749
00:49:00,026 --> 00:49:02,376
Whoa, K! Wait, no,
I gotta go in with you!

750
00:49:02,587 --> 00:49:04,227
You sit tight. I'll be fine.

751
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,462
Wait, no! No!

752
00:49:06,615 --> 00:49:07,392
K!

753
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:10,144
K, don't go in by yourself!

754
00:49:12,734 --> 00:49:13,568
Hi, fellas.

755
00:49:15,735 --> 00:49:17,088
Need to see the boss.

756
00:49:17,404 --> 00:49:18,526
He's busy.

757
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:21,595
Well, I'm gonna just
take a look around.

758
00:49:27,071 --> 00:49:29,411
Looks like we have ourselves
a standoff.

759
00:49:29,565 --> 00:49:31,464
Looks that way.

760
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:38,273
- Still keep the key under the ashtray.
- Lucky guess.

761
00:49:38,426 --> 00:49:39,903
Now, where were we?

762
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,889
I was about to tell you to screw off.

763
00:49:42,042 --> 00:49:43,845
Hey, slick, you bowl in the future?

764
00:49:43,998 --> 00:49:46,080
MiB league champ, three years running.

765
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,844
Well, let's see it.

766
00:49:48,247 --> 00:49:49,954
You did not walk into my

767
00:49:50,107 --> 00:49:51,843
establishment and rip my head off!

768
00:49:51,997 --> 00:49:55,353
My man, we don't have a lot of time.
You really need to tell him something.

769
00:49:55,516 --> 00:49:57,118
I'll tell him this!

770
00:49:57,272 --> 00:49:58,231
All right, your head.

771
00:49:58,394 --> 00:50:02,239
Wait. Hey, if you do this,
I am gonna hunt you down

772
00:50:02,393 --> 00:50:03,515
and make sure you

773
00:50:03,678 --> 00:50:05,116
walk funny for the rest

774
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,003
of your miserable
last days on Earth!

775
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,279
- Tough spare, slick.
- God!

776
00:50:09,432 --> 00:50:10,621
You messed with the wrong head!

777
00:50:10,813 --> 00:50:12,866
- His head's a little...
- You gonna tell us

778
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:14,458
where Dom is?

779
00:50:14,649 --> 00:50:16,836
I'll kill you both.
I swear I'll kill both of youse!

780
00:50:19,071 --> 00:50:21,248
Your hook's a little off.
Want me to clean her?

781
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:22,945
- Sure thing.
- No, no, no.

782
00:50:23,578 --> 00:50:26,724
Come on, I just cleaned
the bathroom with this thing!

783
00:50:26,877 --> 00:50:28,133
No cleaning! No cleaning!

784
00:50:28,287 --> 00:50:32,123
Okay! Okay, all right!
All right, he's in the back.

785
00:50:32,286 --> 00:50:34,751
But he's not gonna talk
to any Men in Black scum like you.

786
00:50:34,904 --> 00:50:36,515
Now give me back my head.

787
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:39,910
K, I call this one
Low Hanging Fruit.

788
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:41,311
That ain't a finger hole,

789
00:50:41,464 --> 00:50:43,104
you sick bastard!

790
00:50:43,258 --> 00:50:44,380
I'll pop your head off

791
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:45,895
and see how you like it.

792
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:49,597
I'm gonna kill both of you!

793
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,966
I'm gonna kill the both of youse!

794
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:53,567
I'll kill you both.

795
00:50:56,924 --> 00:50:59,782
Well, we're on the right track.
Just the wrong train.

796
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:01,412
If he had any secrets,

797
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:03,004
I'm guessing he spilled them.

798
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:05,440
A smart man figures out
what victims have in common.

799
00:51:05,594 --> 00:51:07,032
A smart man would.

800
00:51:07,195 --> 00:51:08,547
That's a big-ass phone.

801
00:51:09,228 --> 00:51:11,827
- Don't put that up to your head.
- Agent O.

802
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:14,292
How's your day been, Agent K?

803
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,539
Oh, fair to middling.

804
00:51:15,692 --> 00:51:16,651
How are things going?

805
00:51:16,814 --> 00:51:17,965
Very good, thank you.

806
00:51:18,157 --> 00:51:19,826
Hey, you saw her like an hour ago.

807
00:51:19,979 --> 00:51:22,099
I need cleanup and containment
at Cosmic Lanes.

808
00:51:22,252 --> 00:51:24,122
Listen, I got a dead Parlaxian.

809
00:51:24,266 --> 00:51:26,865
Now Roman was a Byvoid,
correct me if I'm wrong.

810
00:51:27,019 --> 00:51:30,509
- From the same planetary grouping?
- Yes, a system in the Triangulum Galaxy

811
00:51:30,673 --> 00:51:31,862
wiped out by Boglodites.

812
00:51:32,015 --> 00:51:33,166
Wasn't the third planet?

813
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:35,027
- Glamouria?
- Glamouria.

814
00:51:36,619 --> 00:51:37,645
Thank you, Miss O.

815
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,097
I know where Boris is headed to next.

816
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:45,739
You were close, slick.
It's not a factory, it's the Factory.

817
00:51:49,393 --> 00:51:52,299
Look, if Boris turns out
to be here, I'm gonna kill him.

818
00:51:52,462 --> 00:51:54,898
- I need my gun.
- No deal.

819
00:51:56,749 --> 00:51:58,187
I've been an agent for 14 years.

820
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,745
Which means I'm the senior agent
on this case. Now, I hate to pull rank,

821
00:52:01,899 --> 00:52:03,855
but I am instructing my junior agent,

822
00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:06,838
that's you, to give me my gun
right now. That's an order.

823
00:52:13,484 --> 00:52:14,903
No, no, no, space gun.

824
00:52:15,057 --> 00:52:16,438
You're welcome.

825
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,768
I didn't say thank you.

826
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:27,026
For such an ungainly species,
they've thrived on Earth.

827
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:28,685
I was an agent for three years

828
00:52:28,848 --> 00:52:30,833
before I realized
all models were aliens.

829
00:52:30,987 --> 00:52:33,077
Found out the hard way.

830
00:52:33,423 --> 00:52:34,132
Password?

831
00:52:34,353 --> 00:52:36,846
Hey, look, funky '60s dude,
we don't have a lot of time.

832
00:52:37,009 --> 00:52:38,256

841
00:52:57,801 --> 00:52:59,633
Is that Andy Warhol?

842
00:53:01,417 --> 00:53:02,577
Yep.

843
00:53:04,524 --> 00:53:07,632
Excuse me, Mr. Warhol,
could we have a minute?

844
00:53:07,785 --> 00:53:10,864
Now is not a good time.
This is a be-in.

845
00:53:11,343 --> 00:53:12,149
Just a few

846
00:53:12,302 --> 00:53:13,491

847
00:53:13,645 --> 00:53:16,685
No questions. No answers.

848
00:53:16,848 --> 00:53:18,411
Just being.

849
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:20,914
We have an urgent matter
we would like to discuss with you

850
00:53:21,068 --> 00:53:22,832
regarding one of your party guests.

851
00:53:24,137 --> 00:53:25,556
Why don't you come back

852
00:53:25,709 --> 00:53:27,628
next week, after the happening

853
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,488
has happened.

854
00:53:30,351 --> 00:53:33,324
Sorry, Mr. Warhol. You like
talking slow. We got stuff to do.

855
00:53:33,516 --> 00:53:34,677
I've got a planet to save.

856
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:37,141
You're distressing. Everything

857
00:53:37,295 --> 00:53:39,213
about you upsets me.

858
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:44,459
Damn it, K!
Are you trying to blow my cover?

859
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:46,262
Agent W, your cover is safe.

860
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,180
Whoa, Andy Warhol is one of us?

861
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:49,139
Safe?

862
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,210
You out of your mind?
I'm so out of ideas

863
00:53:51,373 --> 00:53:53,493
I'm painting cans
and bananas for chrissakas.

864
00:53:53,742 --> 00:53:56,303
Actually, Mr. Warhol, I gotta
tell you, I love your work.

865
00:53:56,552 --> 00:53:57,741
Oh. Oh, thank you.

866
00:53:57,904 --> 00:53:58,777
Who's the dumb-ass?

867
00:53:58,988 --> 00:54:01,971
Whoa. Hey. How about a little
professional courtesy here?

868
00:54:02,124 --> 00:54:03,381
- What, dumb-ass?
- Say it again.

- Want me to?
- I dare you.

870
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:05,586
Dumb-ass.

871
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,341
- Agents.

872
00:54:07,504 --> 00:54:09,749

Why are you looking at me?

875
00:54:20,202 --> 00:54:22,456
Oh, all right. You know what?
Agent K,

876
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:25,170
you see what information
you can get from Agent W

877
00:54:25,352 --> 00:54:27,472
and I'll go case the perimeter.

878
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:29,265
- That work for everybody?
- Go do that.

879
00:54:29,419 --> 00:54:30,838
- How about that?
- Oh, cube.

880
00:54:30,991 --> 00:54:32,785

- Very nice.

He's gotta be after the Archanan.

902

Apparently not.

I have to leave in two minutes

before he has a chance
to offer me the antacids,

923
00:56:25,261 --> 00:56:28,138

Here is a relative term.
He's a fifth dimensional being.

00:57:35,693 --> 00:57:36,652
and is about

956
00:57:36,815 --> 00:57:37,966
to shoot from the door,

957
00:57:38,129 --> 00:57:39,414
in which case we're all dead.

958
00:57:41,745 --> 00:57:43,797
Ah, good, that was close one.

959
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,303
K, I need a space gun.

960
00:57:45,648 --> 00:57:46,521
The Boglodiltes

961
00:57:46,665 --> 00:57:48,026
consume any planet in their path.

962
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,427
Mine, Roman's, the Parlaxians'.

963
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:53,272
I tried to stop them, but if we stop
them here, if we deny them Earth,

964
00:57:53,426 --> 00:57:55,469
we can stop them.
They'll starve before

965
00:57:55,632 --> 00:57:56,658
they reach the next planet.

966
00:57:58,413 --> 00:58:00,599
Sixty-three seconds.

967
00:58:00,973 --> 00:58:02,259
How do we do that?
Stop them?

968
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,848
What? Oh!

969
00:58:05,001 --> 00:58:06,900
Sorry. I have something for you.

970
00:58:07,054 --> 00:58:09,135
A gift. It can protect you.

971
00:58:09,806 --> 00:58:13,163
I had to hide it from Boris,
but if you find me again,

972
00:58:13,834 --> 00:58:15,541
I'll give it to you.

973
00:58:15,752 --> 00:58:19,214
Thank you. What a game!
Amazing! It's a real miracle!

974
00:58:19,502 --> 00:58:20,969
Whoa. What do you mean?
What miracle?

975
00:58:21,132 --> 00:58:22,667
Thirty seconds. I have to go.

976
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:23,731
No, we got you.

977
00:58:23,914 --> 00:58:26,235
Negative possibilities are
multiplying as we speak.

978
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:27,635
- Okay.
- Twenty seconds.

979
00:58:27,788 --> 00:58:28,431
All right.

980
00:58:28,584 --> 00:58:29,495
We got it, relax.

981
00:58:29,678 --> 00:58:31,730
If your watch is broken
and I have gastric...

982
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,549
Fly! Find your place in the world!

983
00:58:34,703 --> 00:58:36,304
Oh, dear.

984
00:58:36,496 --> 00:58:38,357
Boris is coming through that door

985
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:39,182
in 12.

986
00:58:39,345 --> 00:58:40,908
11, 10...

987
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:41,809
Wait!

988
00:58:41,963 --> 00:58:43,507
Did you have chocolate milk?

989
00:58:44,073 --> 00:58:45,329
What...? Yes.

990
00:58:46,384 --> 00:58:47,372
Cindy.

991
00:58:48,878 --> 00:58:49,616
K!

992
00:58:49,769 --> 00:58:50,546
- Griffin!
- Got him.

993
00:58:59,437 --> 00:59:00,492
Damn it!

994
00:59:19,116 --> 00:59:20,507
I'm good, I'm good.

995
00:59:20,651 --> 00:59:21,331
What you got?

996
00:59:22,895 --> 00:59:24,880
Damn it! We had him!

997
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,903
Relax, Cochise. We'll find him.

998
00:59:27,661 --> 00:59:29,263
First of all, my name is J, okay?

999
00:59:29,426 --> 00:59:32,217
It's not 'son', it's not 'slick'
and it damn sure ain't no 'Cochise'.

1000
00:59:32,552 --> 00:59:35,190
I'm not gonna relax because
we're running out of time

1001
00:59:35,343 --> 00:59:36,849
and there's an invasion coming.

1002
00:59:37,002 --> 00:59:39,860
You're not really recognizing
my voicial intensity.

1003
00:59:41,423 --> 00:59:43,341
Oh, but there was one guy
who could help.

1004
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,461
Hey, Griffin, Griffin? Where's Griffin?

1005
00:59:46,478 --> 00:59:48,175
Griffin. Where's Griffin at, K?

1006
00:59:48,463 --> 00:59:52,251
He's gone. If Boris gets to him
before we do, that's no buena.

1007
00:59:52,625 --> 00:59:53,776
We need pie.

1008
00:59:54,092 --> 00:59:56,375
- What?
- My granddaddy always said...

1009
00:59:56,557 --> 00:59:58,677
If you got a problem you can't solve,

1010
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:00,911
it helps to get out of
your head, pie. It's good.

1011
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:02,388
- Pie?
- Yeah.

1012
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:04,114
Your granddaddy, heavyset man?

1013
01:00:04,527 --> 01:00:06,742
- A little bit.
- Yeah, you know what?

1014
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:08,363
We've been doing smart stuff.

1015
01:00:08,555 --> 01:00:10,607
We've been following clues,
doing police work.

1016
01:00:10,856 --> 01:00:12,813
It might be time
we do something stupid.

1017
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,824
Something that ain't got
nothing to do with nothing.

1018
01:00:15,978 --> 01:00:17,809
Now, I want some pie, K.
I want some pie.

1019
01:00:17,963 --> 01:00:19,315
Let's go get dumb-ass pie.

1020
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:21,415
Sounds good.

1021
01:00:25,069 --> 01:00:29,615
<i>♪ Sweet, sleepy warmth
of summer nights ♪</i>

1022
01:00:40,587 --> 01:00:45,391
<i>♪ They say that all good things
must end some day ♪</i>

1023
01:00:50,129 --> 01:00:51,031
Have any specials?

1024
01:00:51,759 --> 01:00:54,896
He'll have what he always has after
he reads the menu for 10 minutes

1025
01:00:55,049 --> 01:00:56,440
and asks about specials.

1026
01:00:56,593 --> 01:00:59,154
A slice of apple pie
with a nasty piece of cheddar.

1027
01:00:59,307 --> 01:01:00,784
I'll have the strawberry-rhubarb.

1028
01:01:00,937 --> 01:01:02,606
It's my last meal, I'm gonna splurge.

1029
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:09,272
World-class serial killer out there
and we're having pie.

1030
01:01:09,454 --> 01:01:11,257
What do you do
in your spare time, stretch?

1031
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:16,503
See, I sense you're not embracing
the concept here.

1032
01:01:16,656 --> 01:01:18,603
Pie don't work unless you let it.

1033
01:01:18,766 --> 01:01:20,118
I'm gonna let it.

1034
01:01:20,272 --> 01:01:21,586
And you say we don't talk?

1035
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:24,981
You go ahead. Ask me any question.
Anything you want.

1036
01:01:25,134 --> 01:01:28,721
As long as it doesn't have to do
with the case. Just let her rip.

1037
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:32,375
What's up with you and O?

1038
01:01:33,804 --> 01:01:34,485
Me and O?

1039
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:36,949
Yeah, you and O.

1040
01:01:37,103 --> 01:01:38,388
All right, all right.

1041
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,181
All right, this is it.

1042
01:01:41,419 --> 01:01:44,631
A while back, I was assigned
to keep tabs on a musician.

1043
01:01:44,842 --> 01:01:45,619
Mick Jagger?

1044
01:01:45,773 --> 01:01:47,854
He's in this British band,
the Rolling Stones.

1045
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:49,081
Rings a bell.

1046
01:01:49,225 --> 01:01:52,371
We believed he was on the planet
to breed with Earth women.

1047
01:01:52,591 --> 01:01:55,670
So I was in London
and that's when I met O.

1048
01:01:55,823 --> 01:01:59,631
Just smart. Funny. A great smile.

1049
01:02:00,686 --> 01:02:03,697
And we find ourselves in this pub,
which is a bar, all right?

1050
01:02:03,851 --> 01:02:07,696
Warm beer and
the worst food you ever ate.

1051
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:11,465
We just played darts
till the sun came up.

1052
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:13,268
Neither of us wanted to leave.

1053
01:02:22,283 --> 01:02:24,307
What the hell happened to you, man?

1054
01:02:24,681 --> 01:02:27,059
I don't know.
It hasn't happened yet.

1055
01:02:27,213 --> 01:02:31,001
Come on, what about you, slick?
In the future, you got yourself a girl?

1056
01:02:31,596 --> 01:02:32,823
I got you.

1057
01:02:32,977 --> 01:02:35,537
I cannot believe this,
freaking New York Mets.

1058
01:02:35,691 --> 01:02:37,014
Total losers!

1059
01:02:37,168 --> 01:02:38,903
It's a rough time to be a Mets fan.

1060
01:02:39,057 --> 01:02:41,483
Tell me about it.
Never gonna catch the Cubs.

1061
01:02:41,809 --> 01:02:44,687
That's funny. The Mets
actually win it all this year.

1062
01:02:44,945 --> 01:02:46,231
Oh, yeah.

1063
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,218
No, I'm serious.

1064
01:02:47,372 --> 01:02:48,053
Oh, I'm sure.

1065
01:02:48,206 --> 01:02:50,671
Look, three months from now,
your buddies down there

1066
01:02:50,824 --> 01:02:52,915
are gonna be calling them
the Amazing Mets

1067
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,670
and the Miracle Mets.

1068
01:02:57,164 --> 01:02:58,832
What?

1069
01:02:58,986 --> 01:03:00,597
What you got there, hoss?

1070
01:03:01,585 --> 01:03:05,814
The Archanan said, 'It's amazing
it's a miracle, I'll see you at the game'.

1071
01:03:06,927 --> 01:03:08,279
I know where he is.

1072
01:03:09,037 --> 01:03:11,022
Told you to trust the pie.

1073
01:03:15,088 --> 01:03:18,445
If Griffin's here for a game,
he's either too early or too late.

1074
01:03:18,637 --> 01:03:21,811
He's here. We just gotta
find him before Boris does.

1075
01:03:28,783 --> 01:03:30,615
It's time to give you
your things back,

1076
01:03:30,768 --> 01:03:31,823
partner.

1077
01:03:32,073 --> 01:03:34,029
You get some pie in you,
you get all mushy.

1078
01:03:34,192 --> 01:03:36,273
I'm just tired of carrying your stuff.

1079
01:03:36,465 --> 01:03:39,697
Ah, come on now!
All right! Let's go,

1080
01:03:39,851 --> 01:03:40,695
Mets!

1081
01:03:40,848 --> 01:03:43,246
Let's go, Mets! Let's go,

1082
01:03:43,409 --> 01:03:45,557
- Mets! Let's go, Met...
- Griffin?

1083
01:03:48,137 --> 01:03:49,556
You're just in time!

1084
01:03:49,709 --> 01:03:53,881
Unless this is the one where Robinson
bad-hops it past third, it's almost over.

1085
01:03:55,886 --> 01:03:57,238
Are we missing something?

1086
01:03:57,996 --> 01:03:59,156
The game.

1087
01:04:26,604 --> 01:04:29,711
So this is how you see things?
This is amazing.

1088
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:33,423
It's a gigantic pain in the ass.
But it has its moments.

1089
01:04:33,902 --> 01:04:35,859
This game doesn't happen till October.

1090
01:04:36,012 --> 01:04:37,297
It's always October

1091
01:04:37,546 --> 01:04:39,052
and November and March.

1092
01:04:39,215 --> 01:04:42,092
So many futures, and all real.
Don't know which will coalesce.

1093
01:04:42,255 --> 01:04:43,991
Until then, they're all happening.

1094
01:04:44,145 --> 01:04:47,003
Like this one, it's my favourite moment
in human history.

1095
01:04:47,146 --> 01:04:50,388
All the things that had to converge
for the Mets to win the World Series.

1096
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:53,582
They were in last place every single
season until they won it all.

1097
01:04:53,745 --> 01:04:54,991
You said you had a gift.

1098
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:55,960
That baseball,

1099
01:04:56,113 --> 01:04:59,863
thrown for the last out of game five,
manufactured in '62 by Spalding

1100
01:05:00,017 --> 01:05:03,345
of Chicopee, Massachusetts,
was aerodynamically flawed

1101
01:05:03,498 --> 01:05:05,752
due to the horsehide
being improperly tanned

1102
01:05:05,905 --> 01:05:07,670
because the tanner's wife left him

1103
01:05:07,823 --> 01:05:09,262
for a Puerto Rican golf pro...

1104
01:05:09,425 --> 01:05:10,864
Um, the gift?

1105
01:05:11,017 --> 01:05:13,175
Oh, yes, of course.
In the box.

1106
01:05:17,001 --> 01:05:19,735
Uh, it's the surprise.
To protect the Earth.

1107
01:05:19,888 --> 01:05:20,761
It's a shield.

1108
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:25,901
Shield.

1109
01:05:27,369 --> 01:05:29,805
Archanan. Arc Net.
You put up the Arc Net.

1110
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:31,665
- How?
- When that ball is pitched to

1111
01:05:31,819 --> 01:05:32,624
Davey Johnson,

1112
01:05:32,778 --> 01:05:33,938
who became a player

1113
01:05:34,092 --> 01:05:37,419
because his dad couldn't find a
football to give him for his birthday,

1114
01:05:37,582 --> 01:05:38,292
it hits

1115
01:05:38,446 --> 01:05:40,344
his bat two micrometers too high,

1116
01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:41,783
popping out to Cleon Jones

1117
01:05:42,569 --> 01:05:44,756
who would've been born Clara,
a statistical

1118
01:05:44,938 --> 01:05:48,266
typist, if his parents didn't have
an extra glass of wine that night

1119
01:05:48,429 --> 01:05:50,232
before going to bed

1120
01:05:51,402 --> 01:05:52,313
A miracle

1121
01:05:52,457 --> 01:05:54,864
is what seems impossible
but happens anyway.

1122
01:06:03,889 --> 01:06:05,299
I lost my planet.

1123
01:06:05,481 --> 01:06:07,802
I don't want you to lose yours.

1124
01:06:07,946 --> 01:06:10,353
It'll lake a miracle,
but if you pull this off,

1125
01:06:10,545 --> 01:06:12,463
you'll be my new favourite moment

1126
01:06:12,626 --> 01:06:14,390
in human history.

1127
01:06:14,544 --> 01:06:15,963
Oh, dear.

1128
01:06:16,366 --> 01:06:17,939
I forgot to see this one coming.

1129
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:25,774
Damn it!

1130
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:36,659
Have these in the future?

1131
01:06:36,813 --> 01:06:37,868
No.

1132
01:06:38,088 --> 01:06:39,057
Get on.

1133
01:06:42,673 --> 01:06:44,591
Keep gyro settings at zero gain.

1134
01:06:44,754 --> 01:06:47,218
Balance pitch and yaw
with bursts on the center stalk

1135
01:06:47,372 --> 01:06:48,695
between 80 and 100 psi.

1136
01:06:48,878 --> 01:06:50,134
Aah! I didn't understand...

1137
01:06:50,316 --> 01:06:51,668
any of that!

1138
01:06:51,822 --> 01:06:53,807
- Gyro at zero gain.
- It is.

1139
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,281
Pitch and yaw with short bursts
on the center stalk.

1140
01:06:56,425 --> 01:06:57,068
I did.

1141
01:06:57,231 --> 01:06:59,091
Between 80 and 100 psi.

1142
01:07:00,108 --> 01:07:01,105
Got it.

1143
01:07:03,628 --> 01:07:05,431
The Arc Net! Give it to me!

1144
01:07:05,584 --> 01:07:07,377
This isn't the one where you get it!

1145
01:07:07,531 --> 01:07:09,554
- All right there, chief?
- Hell, yeah.

1146
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:11,185
It'd be better with four wheels!

1147
01:07:11,338 --> 01:07:12,633
Two is, like, my minimum.

1148
01:07:19,241 --> 01:07:21,619
What happens if Boris
gets the Arc Net?

1149
01:07:21,773 --> 01:07:23,959
Boglodite invasion, total
destruction of Earth!

1150
01:07:47,149 --> 01:07:48,789
The box!

1151
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:00,758
Good boy.

1152
01:08:01,132 --> 01:08:02,570
We gotta stop this guy!

1153
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:05,591
I've been trying!

1154
01:08:05,773 --> 01:08:07,059
You haven't been trying?

1155
01:08:07,596 --> 01:08:08,881
Hey, slick.

1156
01:08:08,938 --> 01:08:11,470
In the future, we ever
do the Texas two-step?

1157
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:13,235
Yes, sir!

1158
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:38,553
Did you get him?

1159
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:40,280
Give me a sec.

1160
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:45,334
Is he dead?

1161
01:08:45,775 --> 01:08:47,089
Negative.

1162
01:08:47,952 --> 01:08:49,103
He got away.

1163
01:08:51,472 --> 01:08:53,236
I got Griffin. Let's get out of here.

1164
01:09:07,373 --> 01:09:09,396
I feel younger already.

1165
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:37,813
You pathetic waste of Boglodite flesh.

1166
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:41,140
I'd kill you right now,
if I didn't value my own life.

1167
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:43,087
- Who are you?
- Look at you.

1168
01:09:43,241 --> 01:09:46,195
Every mistake I've ever made,
just waiting to happen.

1169
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,470
What happened to my arm?

1170
01:09:47,633 --> 01:09:49,781
You lose it, shot off by a human.

1171
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:51,354
No human could defeat me.

1172
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:55,795
You spend the next 40 years in
prison, chained up like an animal.

1173
01:09:55,948 --> 01:09:57,751
No prison can hold me!

1174
01:09:57,904 --> 01:10:00,494
They built one especially for us,
on the moon.

1175
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:02,546
No human has been to the moon,

1176
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,270
so they cannot have
built it there already.

1177
01:10:05,423 --> 01:10:08,300
Stop arguing! You can avoid
all of that if you just listen to me!

1178
01:10:08,464 --> 01:10:11,954
You were defeated!
You let it get shot off!

1179
01:10:12,108 --> 01:10:14,803
That wasn't me, that was you!

1180
01:10:19,857 --> 01:10:20,787
What's your plan?

1181
01:10:21,065 --> 01:10:23,156
Prevent the Arc Net
from being deployed.

1182
01:10:23,309 --> 01:10:25,745
- Kill anyone who tries.
- Good plan.

1183
01:10:26,225 --> 01:10:27,155
Didn't work.

1184
01:10:27,309 --> 01:10:28,249
With my help.

1185
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:31,222
We'll get the Arc Net, kill Agent K,

1186
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:33,590
the invasion will be successful

1187
01:10:33,773 --> 01:10:35,250
and we'll get to keep both

1188
01:10:35,441 --> 01:10:37,714
of our ar...! Argh! Stop...

1189
01:10:37,868 --> 01:10:39,306
staring at it!

1190
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:41,234
Listen.

1191
01:10:55,946 --> 01:10:59,063
- You all right?
- Yeah. Thank you for saving my life.

1192
01:10:59,341 --> 01:11:00,213
It's what we do.

1193
01:11:01,259 --> 01:11:02,448
You still have the Arc Net?

1194
01:11:04,587 --> 01:11:06,677
When you're being hunted
by Boris the Animal,

1195
01:11:06,831 --> 01:11:08,471
you get good at hiding things.

1196
01:11:32,811 --> 01:11:34,835
This will save your world.

1197
01:11:37,616 --> 01:11:39,697
Once it's outside the atmosphere,
it gets

1198
01:11:39,851 --> 01:11:41,107
a whole lot bigger.

1199
01:11:42,258 --> 01:11:44,022
All you have to do is deploy it.

1200
01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:48,338
You mean in space?
Well, how do you suppose we do that?

1201
01:11:48,492 --> 01:11:51,062
Ah, it's just one small step.

1202
01:12:04,977 --> 01:12:05,965
The moon launch.

1203
01:12:09,293 --> 01:12:10,895
Cape Canaveral.

1204
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:14,932
July 16th, 1969.

1205
01:12:15,306 --> 01:12:16,812
We got six hours to get to Florida.

1206
01:12:17,128 --> 01:12:18,452
Better get a move on, slick.

1207
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:19,670
Uh, wait, uh, hold up.

1208
01:12:19,823 --> 01:12:21,876
Not us.
Uh, I'm gonna do this one alone.

1209
01:12:22,029 --> 01:12:22,902
He has to be the...

1210
01:12:23,055 --> 01:12:23,957
Griffin. Shh...shh.

1211
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:25,136
What do you mean, alone?

1212
01:12:25,865 --> 01:12:27,668
I'm gonna go to Florida.
You stay here.

1213
01:12:27,822 --> 01:12:29,011
I need you to trust me.

1214
01:12:29,452 --> 01:12:33,010
Trust you? I don't think so.
Something you're not telling me, slick?

1215
01:12:33,164 --> 01:12:34,583
You're not going to Florida.

1216
01:12:34,736 --> 01:12:36,434
That ain't gonna happen, partner.

1217
01:12:36,587 --> 01:12:37,911
Look, K.

1218
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:40,625
Please, I will not allow you
to go to Florida.

1219
01:12:42,668 --> 01:12:43,349
Stop me.

1220
01:12:48,336 --> 01:12:49,717
You die there!

1221
01:12:52,335 --> 01:12:55,308
Cape Canaveral. Apollo launch.

1222
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:58,904
Boris kills you there.

1223
01:13:01,225 --> 01:13:02,702
That's what I'm here for.

1224
01:13:03,306 --> 01:13:04,745
That's what I came back to stop.

1225
01:13:04,937 --> 01:13:06,836
Oh, dear. We're in this one.

1226
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:10,010
K...

1227
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,753
I saw the file,
I looked at the report.

1228
01:13:12,906 --> 01:13:14,067
I said I told you everything...

1229
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:17,097
That's for lying to me.

1230
01:13:17,327 --> 01:13:18,354
Look, I'm sorry, man!

1231
01:13:21,288 --> 01:13:22,967
That's for telling me the truth!

1232
01:13:24,175 --> 01:13:25,968
I'm trying to protect you.

1233
01:13:27,148 --> 01:13:28,539
Man!

1234
01:13:30,505 --> 01:13:33,075
The bitterest truth is better
than the sweetest lies.

1235
01:13:36,652 --> 01:13:38,417
He has to go to Cape Canaveral.

1236
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:41,236
He must deploy the Arc Net
as he did before.

1237
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:42,828
There's no other way.

1238
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:46,415
K is the only hope in saving Earth.

1239
01:13:47,211 --> 01:13:48,688
Can I save him?

1240
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:53,205
Is there any future
where I save his life?

1241
01:13:55,536 --> 01:13:57,272
Yes.

1242
01:13:58,729 --> 01:14:00,878
But where there is death

1243
01:14:01,769 --> 01:14:04,119
there will always be death.

1244
01:14:21,228 --> 01:14:22,993
According to you,
I've done this before.

1245
01:14:23,146 --> 01:14:24,499
So we know it's possible.

1246
01:14:24,652 --> 01:14:26,551
If you're half the agent
you say you are,

1247
01:14:26,704 --> 01:14:28,920
you'll make sure
I don't get killed doing it.

1248
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:35,029
So are we partners? You tell me.

1249
01:14:37,772 --> 01:14:39,316
Let's go.

1250
01:14:51,851 --> 01:14:52,762
Agent K.

1251
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,258
- How are you?
- I'm good.

1252
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:57,461
Okay, group hug on the way
to doing what we're doing.

1253
01:14:57,614 --> 01:15:01,652
This morning, man is about
to launch himself on a trip to the moon

1254
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:04,213
with the expectation of landing there.

1255
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:05,785
Look, I gotta ask you.

1256
01:15:05,929 --> 01:15:08,212
If we pull this off,
fix things the way they were,

1257
01:15:08,365 --> 01:15:10,101
O and I, are we...?

1258
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:11,405
A wise man once told me,

1259
01:15:11,568 --> 01:15:14,263
don't ask questions you don't
want to know the answer to.

1260
01:15:15,529 --> 01:15:18,100
- I said that, didn't I?
- Yes, sir.

1261
01:15:22,569 --> 01:15:23,988
Here they are.

1262
01:15:24,813 --> 01:15:26,865
- What are they?
- Jetpacks.

1263
01:15:27,019 --> 01:15:28,342
Jetpacks?

1264
01:15:29,713 --> 01:15:32,178
No, no, no.
We're not doing jetpacks.

1265
01:15:32,332 --> 01:15:34,585
There's a reason we don't
have these in the future.

1266
01:15:34,729 --> 01:15:35,688
K, we gotta drive.

1267
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:38,939
Can't drive to Florida from Manhattan
in five hours, chief.

1268
01:15:39,218 --> 01:15:42,996
Yeah, we can. The red button,
standard issue in every MiB car.

1269
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:44,953
Press the red button,
goes into hyperdrive.

1270
01:15:45,097 --> 01:15:46,832
No red buttons yet, slick.

1271
01:15:48,492 --> 01:15:50,544
Come on, man.

1272
01:15:55,406 --> 01:15:56,212
Do you know

1273
01:15:56,365 --> 01:15:57,622
how to work this stupid thing?

1274
01:15:57,775 --> 01:15:59,827
It's like with anything.

1275
01:15:59,981 --> 01:16:03,769
Just have to strap yourself in,
hope for the best.

1276
01:16:04,814 --> 01:16:06,071
Isn't that right, Miss O?

1277
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:09,293
Unfortunately, it is.

1278
01:16:20,015 --> 01:16:21,272
You ready, slick?

1279
01:16:23,055 --> 01:16:24,523
Let's get it.

1280
01:16:24,753 --> 01:16:26,517
This is gonna be interesting!

1281
01:16:38,889 --> 01:16:41,104
It's just minutes to the

1282
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:42,860
historic launch of Apollo 11

1283
01:16:43,023 --> 01:16:45,267
with all going well.

1284
01:17:00,976 --> 01:17:04,016
I'm so glad this isn't
one of the times we explode.

1285
01:17:04,265 --> 01:17:05,905
One of the times?

1286
01:17:08,619 --> 01:17:10,096
Oh, we got company...

1287
01:17:14,441 --> 01:17:15,860
The hell?

1288
01:17:17,385 --> 01:17:19,255
Is that a battery belt?

1289
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,227
All right, I got it.

1290
01:17:33,296 --> 01:17:35,722
No, any reality
that gets the shield deployed

1291
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:37,621
is one where you tell the truth.

1292
01:17:37,966 --> 01:17:39,318
The truth?

1293
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:41,553
The truth is the only path.

1294
01:17:41,745 --> 01:17:43,346
This is a restricted area!

1295
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:50,069
Yes, sir, it is.

1296
01:17:50,223 --> 01:17:53,081
Good day, gentlemen.
Great day for America, isn't it?

1297
01:17:53,224 --> 01:17:56,754
My name is Agent J.
This is Agent K. That's Griff.

1298
01:17:56,907 --> 01:17:58,892
We're from a secret government
organization

1299
01:17:59,055 --> 01:18:02,508
that polices and monitors
alien activity on and off planet Earth.

1300
01:18:03,851 --> 01:18:04,944
Heh, here's the thing.

1301
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:07,476
We have this special
little metal thingy

1302
01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:11,254
that Griff gave us that we have
to get on top of that rocket,

1303
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:14,899
to prevent an alien invasion.

1304
01:18:18,188 --> 01:18:19,090
That worked.

1305
01:18:19,243 --> 01:18:21,871
- Like a charm.
- Sir, Della Gate. We have a problem.

1306
01:18:22,187 --> 01:18:25,429
Three trespassers. No IDs,
but they've got weapons, sir.

1307
01:18:25,611 --> 01:18:27,692
Some kind I've never seen before.

1308
01:18:35,154 --> 01:18:36,621
What breed of fool do you have to be

1309
01:18:36,784 --> 01:18:39,575
to penetrate my site
on the day of the most massive feat

1310
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:40,946
attempted by mankind?

1311
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,891
Watched by God, the population
of the planet and my own

1312
01:18:44,073 --> 01:18:45,137
- firstborn
- Colonel?

1313
01:18:46,029 --> 01:18:47,084
Colonel, they had these.

1314
01:18:48,206 --> 01:18:50,287
They said they needed
to put something on the rocket

1315
01:18:50,441 --> 01:18:51,572
for an invasion.

1316
01:18:55,629 --> 01:18:56,588
Thanks.

1317
01:18:56,780 --> 01:18:58,008
I got 10 minutes to launch.

1318
01:18:58,219 --> 01:19:02,093
If you pose a threat to that rocket,
you tell me now and do not lie to me.

1319
01:19:06,351 --> 01:19:08,269
I told the truth last time.

1320
01:19:13,065 --> 01:19:14,800
Sir, this man came here from

1321
01:19:14,992 --> 01:19:16,306
the future to protect me

1322
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:19,730
so I can attach a shield to the top
of that rocket and save the world.

1323
01:19:19,883 --> 01:19:21,782
I need your help to do that.

1324
01:19:24,813 --> 01:19:26,069
Take them to the brig.

1325
01:19:26,223 --> 01:19:27,661
You're slipping, Griff.

1326
01:19:28,169 --> 01:19:29,301
Sir, if I may.

1327
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:45,557
Corporal.

1328
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:48,185
You men are no longer needed.

1329
01:19:48,655 --> 01:19:49,748
I'll take the prisoners.

1330
01:19:50,093 --> 01:19:51,858
- Sir, are you...?
- Dismissed.

1331
01:20:00,336 --> 01:20:01,295
Follow me.

1332
01:20:08,363 --> 01:20:10,454
You did the future thing.
What did you show him?

1333
01:20:10,607 --> 01:20:12,659
Only what he needed to see.

1334
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:15,287
I have to go now.

1335
01:20:16,332 --> 01:20:17,723
What? No, no, no. Come on.

1336
01:20:18,097 --> 01:20:19,536
You don't need me any more.

1337
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:22,231
All right, Griff,
don't start flipping on me.

1338
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:25,712
When Boris' arm is taken, the past
will be as it was. K will survive.

1339
01:20:25,865 --> 01:20:27,764
He will not know you were ever here.

1340
01:20:29,385 --> 01:20:33,298
All right. Arm gone, got it.
Like a reset?

1341
01:20:33,451 --> 01:20:36,597
When that happens, go home.
Leave.

1342
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:37,393
You coming?

1343
01:20:37,546 --> 01:20:39,465
Yeah, all right!

1344
01:20:40,491 --> 01:20:43,703
Uh, thanks, man.
Hey, will I ever see you again?

1345
01:20:43,953 --> 01:20:45,650
Anything's possible.

1346
01:20:47,789 --> 01:20:49,487
Oh, Griff.

1347
01:20:55,528 --> 01:20:57,936
I can never bear to watch this part.

1348
01:20:59,787 --> 01:21:01,398
Armstrong and Aldrin are scheduled

1349
01:21:01,551 --> 01:21:03,383
to set foot on the moon

1350
01:21:03,536 --> 01:21:07,344
on early Monday morning,
Eastern Daylight Time.

1351
01:21:08,658 --> 01:21:09,396
Where's Griffin?

1352
01:21:09,578 --> 01:21:11,247
Doing his own thing.

1353
01:21:32,969 --> 01:21:33,650
Gentlemen.

1354
01:21:37,582 --> 01:21:39,731
This elevator
will take you to the top.

1355
01:21:39,884 --> 01:21:41,802
To get the Arc Net
outside the atmosphere,

1356
01:21:41,965 --> 01:21:44,842
you need to strap it to the escape
rocket above the capsule!

1357
01:21:45,034 --> 01:21:46,358
You do not want to be

1358
01:21:46,511 --> 01:21:48,659
anywhere near this rocket
when it takes off!

1359
01:21:48,813 --> 01:21:51,095
- Questions?
- No. Thank you for this, colonel.

1360
01:21:51,278 --> 01:21:52,783
Some job you got there.

1361
01:21:53,004 --> 01:21:54,126
Hey, thanks a lot, bro.

1362
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:56,687
What did Griff show you back there?

1363
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:58,231
How important you are.

1364
01:21:58,537 --> 01:22:00,043
You and your partner.

1365
01:22:07,984 --> 01:22:10,295
Look, if everything goes right
the way we hope it does,

1366
01:22:10,478 --> 01:22:13,105
I'm gonna end up
getting out of here pretty quick,

1367
01:22:13,259 --> 01:22:16,539
so I'm not gonna have a chance
to say a proper goodbye.

1368
01:22:16,721 --> 01:22:20,106
If things go wrong, not gonna
have a chance to, either.

1369
01:22:21,996 --> 01:22:23,540
So I guess win or lose, this is it.

1370
01:22:27,884 --> 01:22:29,716
I see why I recruited you.

1371
01:22:32,459 --> 01:22:33,523
You're a good man.

1372
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,414
Good man.

1373
01:22:40,783 --> 01:22:42,931
Man, what the hell happened to you?

1374
01:22:43,344 --> 01:22:45,588
I told you,
it still hasn't happened yet.

1375
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:51,860
I'll take this one!

1376
01:22:52,234 --> 01:22:53,299
Naughty...

1377
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:57,873
Get a pedicure if you get a second.

1378
01:23:07,377 --> 01:23:09,420
And lift off.

1379
01:23:49,163 --> 01:23:50,832
Just passed the two-minute mark

1380
01:23:50,985 --> 01:23:54,294
in the countdown, and all is still go
as we monitor our status board.

1381
01:24:14,731 --> 01:24:17,426
Astronauts report it feels good.
Power transfer is complete.

1382
01:24:18,155 --> 01:24:21,099
Neil Armstrong just reported back
it's been a real smooth countdown.

1383
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,065
Hey!

1384
01:24:34,286 --> 01:24:35,859
Boris, can you give me a hand?

1385
01:24:36,012 --> 01:24:38,390
Hey! Aah!

1386
01:24:42,255 --> 01:24:42,994
Hey!

1387
01:24:43,886 --> 01:24:45,459
You hear me calling you?

1388
01:24:46,283 --> 01:24:47,722
Boris the Animal!

1389
01:24:48,201 --> 01:24:48,844
Hey!

1390
01:24:49,007 --> 01:24:51,088
Boris the Animal!

1391
01:24:52,910 --> 01:24:55,193
It's just Boris!

1392
01:24:58,856 --> 01:24:59,854
You're gonna lose.

1393
01:25:00,141 --> 01:25:01,359
Let's agree to disagree.

1394
01:25:20,176 --> 01:25:21,298
Hey!

1395
01:25:22,286 --> 01:25:23,859
Boris the Animal!

1396
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:34,197
Right.

1397
01:25:34,993 --> 01:25:35,636
Left.

1398
01:26:02,537 --> 01:26:03,409
You're gonna lose.

1399
01:26:03,563 --> 01:26:05,548
Let's agree to disagree.

1400
01:26:14,064 --> 01:26:15,378
Hey!

1401
01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:17,776
Boris the Animal!

1402
01:26:24,432 --> 01:26:25,103
Right.

1403
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:26,925
Left. Left.

1404
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:28,728
Right.

1405
01:26:32,622 --> 01:26:34,521
That's not possible.

1406
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,631
Let's agree to disagree.

1407
01:26:42,097 --> 01:26:44,658
That's not possible!

1408
01:26:53,577 --> 01:26:54,545
K!

1409
01:26:56,137 --> 01:26:58,391
I win! I'm better than me!

1410
01:27:05,488 --> 01:27:06,706
That's my partner.

1411
01:27:07,147 --> 01:27:08,912
That's my partner!

1412
01:27:14,858 --> 01:27:15,855
If we call this in,

1413
01:27:16,009 --> 01:27:18,579
- they'll scrub the launch.
- I didn't see anything

1414
01:27:51,858 --> 01:27:53,651
- Where's your partner?
- He went home.

1415
01:27:53,805 --> 01:27:55,243
- How does that work?
- You got me.

1416
01:27:55,406 --> 01:27:56,663
Come on!

1417
01:28:10,895 --> 01:28:11,672
Get down!

1418
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:42,744
Bingo.

1419
01:28:43,627 --> 01:28:45,612
Man, that is
some next-level stuff.

1420
01:28:55,212 --> 01:28:56,497
You ever want to see more,

1421
01:28:56,689 --> 01:28:59,863
I know a top-secret organization
that could use a man like you.

1422
01:29:01,705 --> 01:29:03,316
I wish I could.

1423
01:29:03,853 --> 01:29:04,793
Thank you.

1424
01:29:05,387 --> 01:29:07,190
I'll see you around, K.

1425
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:09,521
Look out!

1426
01:29:14,575 --> 01:29:16,177
Go ahead.

1427
01:29:16,426 --> 01:29:18,095
Arrest me.

1428
01:29:19,629 --> 01:29:21,231
Not this time.

1429
01:29:30,831 --> 01:29:33,708
Where there's death,
there will always be death.

1430
01:29:42,665 --> 01:29:45,782
Daddy! Daddy!

1431
01:29:49,705 --> 01:29:50,453
Hey...

1432
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:53,339
Hey, my name's K.
What's your name?

1433
01:29:53,867 --> 01:29:54,864
James.

1434
01:29:55,018 --> 01:29:57,454
James? That's a nice name.

1435
01:29:57,646 --> 01:29:58,969
Where's my dad?

1436
01:30:01,712 --> 01:30:03,505
What have you got there?
What is that?

1437
01:30:03,659 --> 01:30:04,982
My dad gave it to me.

1438
01:30:05,136 --> 01:30:07,313
We timed the launch.

1439
01:30:14,122 --> 01:30:15,858
Where is my daddy?

1440
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:21,142
He, uh...

1441
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:25,295
He went to go do something
very special.

1442
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:27,251
And he wanted me

1443
01:30:27,405 --> 01:30:31,605
to stay here and take care
of his best pal.

1444
01:30:36,266 --> 01:30:38,357
When is he gonna be back?

1445
01:30:39,469 --> 01:30:40,793
He, uh...

1446
01:30:54,987 --> 01:30:56,377
James...

1447
01:30:57,710 --> 01:30:59,408
if you look right here,

1448
01:30:59,561 --> 01:31:02,678
I will tell you the only thing
you ever need to know.

1449
01:31:07,953 --> 01:31:09,650
Your daddy is a hero.

1450
01:31:09,871 --> 01:31:12,211
My daddy is a hero?

1451
01:31:15,309 --> 01:31:18,454
- Want to take a walk with me?
- Yes.

1452
01:31:27,632 --> 01:31:28,850
James?

You're late.

1464
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:13,427
Uh, sorry. Lost track of time.

1465
01:32:15,306 --> 01:32:16,467
How do you know that song?

1466
01:32:16,812 --> 01:32:18,768
Drink your coffee.
We got work to do.

1467
01:32:19,632 --> 01:32:21,329
What do you know
and what do you don't?

1468
01:32:21,521 --> 01:32:23,151
How do I know what I don't know?

1469
01:32:23,305 --> 01:32:26,105
That's a really good question.
Did we go to Wu's last night?

1470
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:26,997
Yeah.

1471
01:32:27,313 --> 01:32:28,148
Boglodites?

1472
01:32:28,301 --> 01:32:29,078
Extinct for 40 years.

1473
01:32:29,452 --> 01:32:31,639
Perfect. Did we talk
on the phone last night?

1474
01:32:31,792 --> 01:32:32,981
You hung up on me.

1475
01:32:33,384 --> 01:32:34,957
Yeah, I did.

1476
01:32:35,945 --> 01:32:38,036
But that was because
of all those secrets

1477
01:32:38,544 --> 01:32:41,335
the universe doesn't know about.

1478
01:32:45,871 --> 01:32:46,609
But...

1479
01:32:46,993 --> 01:32:48,691
I've realized that

1480
01:32:48,873 --> 01:32:51,251
last night was a long,

1481
01:32:51,405 --> 01:32:53,620
long time ago.

1482
01:32:57,705 --> 01:33:00,343
And, really,
I just want to say thank you.

1483
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,827
It's been my privilege...

1484
01:33:12,273 --> 01:33:14,585
You know, there's really
high possibility now

1485
01:33:14,728 --> 01:33:17,232
that I might know some things
you don't know.

1486
01:33:17,385 --> 01:33:18,891
I doubt it.

1487
01:33:19,054 --> 01:33:20,953
I bet I know what went down
with you and O.

1488
01:33:21,097 --> 01:33:22,938
She's a very fine lady,
but you know the rules.

1489
01:33:23,082 --> 01:33:25,172
There's no fraternizing
amongst agents.

1490
01:33:25,355 --> 01:33:27,954
I think y'all might have
fraternized a time or two.

1491
01:33:30,984 --> 01:33:34,197
This is my new favourite moment
in human history.

1492
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:37,458
Unless this is the one
where K forgot to leave a tip.

1493
01:33:51,469 --> 01:33:53,272
Almost forgot.

1494
01:34:01,453 --> 01:34:03,093
That was a close one.
