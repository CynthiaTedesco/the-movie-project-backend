1
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,611
At last.

2
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,792
Snoke trained you well.

3
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,086
I killed Snoke.

4
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,796
I'll kill you.

5
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,048
My boy.

6
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,719
I made Snoke.

7
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,640
I have been every voice...

8
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,392
you have ever heard...

9
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,811
inside your head.

10
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,371
The First Order was just the beginning.

11
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,376
I will give you so much more.

12
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,045
You'll die first.

13
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,756
I have died before.

14
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,469
The dark side of the Force
is a pathway...

15
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,640
to many abilities some consider to be...

16
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,227
unnatural.

17
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,822
What could you give me?

18
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,491
Everything.

19
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,330
A new Empire.

20
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,607
The might of the Final Order
will soon be ready.

21
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:03,113
It will be yours
if you do as I ask.

22
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,491
Kill the girl!

23
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,785
End the Jedi...

24
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:13,164
and become what
your grandfather Vader could not.

25
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,088
You will rule all the galaxy...

26
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,924
as the new emperor.

27
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,552
But beware...

28
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,638
she is not who you think she is.

29
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,894
Who is she?

30
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,127
Are you ever gonna go?

31
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,633
- He can't beat us every time.
- Apparently he does.

32
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,717
How does he do it?

33
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,260
This guy right here?
It's 'cause he cheats.

34
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,638
- I'm kidding!
- Come on. Take your turn.

35
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,264
- You're 250 years old.
- You're taking forever. That's cheating.

36
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,558
- Of course you're better than us.
- That's why we think you're cheating.

37
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,229
- Don't worry!
- We're not gonna turn it off.

38
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,274
- He's cheating.
- Definitely.

39
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,653
Klaud, I hope you fixed that surge.

40
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,578
T-minus five.

41
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,746
Artoo.

42
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,011
Boolio, good to see you.
You got something for us?

43
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,889
From a new ally!
A spy in the First Order!

44
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,892
A spy? Who?

45
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,268
I don't know!

46
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,397
Transfer the message!
Get it to Leia, hurry!

47
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,942
This could be big, Artoo.

48
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,204
Locked on target.

49
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,164
Finn, we're about to be cooked!

50
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,624
We're almost there!

51
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,460
Poe, we got it.

52
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,795
How do we thank you?

53
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,672
Win the war!

54
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,514
Sorry, I'm sorry!
I know!

55
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,109
Finn, you're supposed
to be getting rid of those things!

56
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,531
- I got one!
- How many are left?

57
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,782
Too many.

58
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:54,868
What?

59
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,624
Good thinking, Chewie.
Finn, we can boulder these TIEs!

60
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,251
I was just thinking that.

61
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,600
Get us back to base!

62
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,061
How thick do you think that ice wall is?

63
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,198
- Poe!
- I know, I know!

64
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,536
What are you doing?

65
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,704
Lightspeed skipping.

66
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,998
How do you know how to do that?

67
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,006
Yeah, well, Rey's not here, is she?

68
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,640
Last jump, maybe forever.

69
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,600
Hold on!

70
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,907
Be with me.

71
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,620
Be with me.

72
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,499
Be with me.

73
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,294
They're not with me.

74
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,718
Rey.

75
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,387
Be patient.

76
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,389
I'm starting to think
it isn't possible...

77
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,516
to hear voices of the Jedi
who came before.

78
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,393
Nothing's impossible.

79
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,311
Nothing's impossible.

80
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,021
I'm gonna run the training course.

81
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,911
No!

82
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,120
Join me.

83
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,747
Join me.

84
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,374
Ben, no!

85
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,541
You killed him!

86
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,918
Ben!

87
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,683
BB-8, I'm so sorry.

88
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,105
I didn't finish the training course.

89
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,023
Got distracted.

90
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,281
I'm just not feeling myself.

91
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,283
I know it looks...

92
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,618
It looks like I'm making excuses.

93
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,080
Don't tell me what things look like.
Tell me what they are.

94
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,793
I think I'm just tired.
That's all.

95
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,546
General...

96
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,798
the Falcon still hasn't arrived.

97
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,550
Commander's asking for guidance.

98
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,472
I will earn your brother's saber...

99
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,224
one day.

100
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,479
No, you can't do it for me.

101
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,857
Never underestimate a droid.

102
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,861
Yes, Master.

103
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,787
Rey!

104
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,789
Falcon's back!

105
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,209
Come on, get over here!

106
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,711
I need a fire crew here!

107
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,963
And another one in the back!
Go, go!

108
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,506
Coming!

109
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,008
It's on fire!

110
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,844
Whole thing's on fire.
All of it.

111
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,095
- It's on fire.
- Hey.

112
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,555
- Hey!
- There's a spy?

113
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,390
Really could have
used your help out there.

114
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,558
How'd it go?

115
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,352
Really bad, actually.
Really bad.

116
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,895
- Han's ship...
- What'd you do to the droid?

117
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,605
What'd you do to the Falcon?

118
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,357
The Falcon's in a lot better shape
than he is.

119
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,817
- BB-8's not on fire.
- What's left of him isn't on fire.

120
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,527
- Tell me what happened.
- You tell me first.

121
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,737
- You know what you are?
- What?

122
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,280
You're difficult. Really difficult.

123
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,782
- You're a difficult man.
- You, you are...

124
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,033
- Rey.
- Finn.

125
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:28,993
You made it back.

126
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,203
Yeah. Barely.

127
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,413
- So, bad mood?
- Me?

128
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,040
- Him.
- Always.

129
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,917
Do we have a spy?

130
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,834
Well...

131
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,045
You lightspeed skipped?

132
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,338
Yeah, well,
it got us back here, didn't it?

133
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,672
Poe, the compressor's down.

134
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,633
- I know, I was there.
- Every time.

135
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,759
You can't lightspeed skip the Falcon!

136
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,845
- Actually, it turns out you can.
- All right, guys, we just landed, okay?

137
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:48,888
What happened?

138
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:49,972
Bad news, that's what happened.

139
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:50,932
No spy?

140
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,141
No.
Spy.

141
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,768
Did we make contact with a spy or not?

142
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,020
There's a mole in the First Order,
and they sent us a message.

143
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,563
You dropped a tree on him?

144
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,315
- You blew both sub-alternators?
- Well, you know what...

145
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,650
maybe you should've been out there
with us!

146
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,235
- You know I wanna be out there with you.
- Yeah, but you're not.

147
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,153
You're here training.
For what?

148
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,447
You're the best fighter we have.

149
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,324
We need you.

150
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,826
Out there, not here.

151
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,244
Junior...

152
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,703
get Artoo into reconditioning.

153
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,830
It's true.

154
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,375
What's the message?

155
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,087
We've decoded the intel
from the First Order spy...

156
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,922
and it confirms the worst.

157
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,009
Somehow, Palpatine returned.

158
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,599
Wait. Do we believe this?

159
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,143
It cannot be.

160
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,394
The Emperor is dead.

161
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,813
Dark science.
Cloning.

162
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,481
Secrets only the Sith knew.

163
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,400
He's been planning his revenge.

164
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,736
His followers have been building
something for years.

165
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,031
The largest fleet
the galaxy has ever known.

166
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,577
He calls it the Final Order.

167
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,164
In 16 hours,
attacks on all free worlds begin.

168
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,376
The Emperor and his fleet
have been hiding in the Unknown Regions.

169
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,670
On a world called Exegol.

170
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,676
Exegol does not appear
on any star chart.

171
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,181
But legend describes it
as the hidden world of the Sith.

172
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,226
There were always whispers
of his hunger to cheat death.

173
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,438
So, Palpatine's been
out there all this time.

174
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,106
Pulling the strings.

175
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,692
Always. In the shadows.
From the very beginning.

176
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,279
If we want to stop him,
we must find him.

177
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,948
Must find Exegol.

178
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,450
General?

179
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,870
Can I speak with you?

180
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,622
I know how to get to Exegol.

181
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,916
- Tell me.
- Luke searched for it.

182
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,293
For a long time.
He nearly found it.

183
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,378
There are ciphers here
I can't read.

184
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,381
But he said to get there,
you need one of these.

185
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,841
A Sith wayfinder.

186
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,969
They're compasses
that lead the way to Exegol.

187
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,514
To stop
what we both know is coming...

188
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,058
I need to finish what Luke started.

189
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,268
Find Exegol.

190
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,728
Find the Emperor.

191
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,021
No.

192
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,691
I don't want to go
without your blessing, but I will.

193
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,445
I will.

194
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,406
It's what you would do.

195
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,243
So, you got her up and running?

196
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,452
You were right before.

197
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,080
I'm gonna pick up
Luke's search for Exegol.

198
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,332
I'm gonna start
where his trail went cold.

199
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,042
The Forbidden Desert of Pasaana.

200
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,044
Yeah, I know. We're going with you.

201
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,713
Chewie, you get that compressor fixed?

202
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,674
I need to go alone.

203
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,841
Yeah. Alone with friends.

204
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,051
It's too dangerous, Finn.

205
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,011
We go together.

206
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,892
I wholeheartedly agree.

207
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,732
Rose, last chance.

208
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,151
The General asked me to study the specs
of old Destroyers.

209
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,653
So we can stop the fleet
if you find it.

210
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,946
"If"?

211
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,489
When.

212
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,575
When.

213
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,960
Hey, we should get going.

214
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,422
What is it?

215
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,257
Nothing.

216
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,302
In the event that I do not return...

217
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,598
I want you to know
that you have been a real friend, Artoo.

218
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,183
My best one, in fact.

219
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,983
There's so much I want to tell you.

220
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,653
Tell me when you get back.

221
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:55,760
Rey...

222
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,763
never be afraid of who you are.

223
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,410
It is.

224
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,211
- Knights of Ren.
- Ghouls.

225
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,217
We have a spy in our ranks...

226
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,011
who just sent a message
to the Resistance.

227
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,807
Whoever this traitor is won't stop us.

228
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,269
With what I've seen on Exegol...

229
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,605
the First Order is about to become
a true Empire.

230
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:39,363
I sense unease about my appearance,
General Hux.

231
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,285
About the mask?

232
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,662
No, sir. Well done.

233
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:47,997
I like it.

234
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:52,251
Forgive me, sir,
but these allies on Exegol...

235
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,502
they sound like a cult.

236
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,629
Conjurers and soothsayers.

237
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,965
They've conjured
legions of Star Destroyers.

238
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:01,260
The Sith fleet will increase
our resources ten-thousandfold.

239
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,304
Such range and power

240
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,973
will correct the error
of Starkiller Base.

241
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,643
We'll need to increase recruitments.
Harvest more of the galaxy's young.

242
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,937
This fleet, what is it, a gift?

243
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,148
What is he asking for in return?

244
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,237
Prepare to crush
any worlds that defy us.

245
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,908
My knights and I are going hunting
for the scavenger.

246
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,919
You sure this is it?

247
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,088
These are the exact coordinates
that Master Luke left behind.

248
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,138
What is this?

249
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,891
The Acky Acky Festival of the Ancestors.

250
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,812
This celebration occurs
only once every 42 years.

251
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,979
Well, that's lucky.

252
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,439
Lucky indeed.

253
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,108
This festival is known for both
its colorful kites...

254
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,361
and its delectable sweets.

255
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,884
I've never seen anything like this.

256
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,761
I've never seen so few wayfinders.

257
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,012
There's always random

258
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,181
First Order patrols
in crowds like these.

259
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,808
So, keep your heads down.

260
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:31,892
Chewie.

261
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,441
Let's split up.
See what the locals know.

262
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,631
She is saying, "Welcome."

263
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,642
Her name is Nambi Ghima.

264
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,145
That's an excellent name. I'm Rey.

265
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,066
She would be honored
to know your family name, too.

266
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,613
I don't have one.

267
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,031
I'm just Rey.

268
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,178
Palpatine wants you dead.

269
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,098
- Serving another master?
- No.

270
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,601
I have other plans.

271
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,312
I offered you my hand once.

272
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,773
You wanted to take it.

273
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,192
Why didn't you?

274
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,195
You could've killed me.

275
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,738
Why didn't you?

276
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,991
You can't hide, Rey.

277
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,242
Not from me.

278
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:16,372
I see through the cracks in your mask.

279
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,040
You're haunted.

280
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,335
You can't stop seeing
what you did to your father.

281
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,089
Do you still count the days
since your parents left?

282
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,510
Such pain in you, such anger.

283
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,137
I don't wanna have to kill you.

284
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,431
I'm going to find you

285
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,475
and I'm going to turn you
to the dark side.

286
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,187
When I offer you my hand again...

287
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,189
you'll take it.

288
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,109
We'll see.

289
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,241
Has he seen him?

290
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,827
We have to go. Back to the Falcon. Now.

291
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,537
- Why?
- It's Ren.

292
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,249
Sir, we've had this analyzed.

293
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:03,377
It comes from the Middian System,
Pasaana, Forbidden Valley.

294
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,461
Prepare my ship.

295
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,588
Alert the local troops.
Send a division.

296
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,258
Yes, Supreme Leader.

297
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,137
Freeze.

298
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,596
Hold it right there.

299
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,390
I've located the Resistance fugitives.

300
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:17,599
All units, report...

301
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,440
Follow me.

302
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,033
Hurry.

303
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,578
Leia sent me a transmission.

304
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,456
Okay.

305
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,541
How'd you find us?

306
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,378
Wookiees stand out in a crowd.

307
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,468
It's good to see you too, old buddy.

308
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,845
This is General Lando Calrissian.

309
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:55,929
We know who he is, Threepio.

310
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,639
It is an honor, General.

311
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,642
General Calrissian,
we're looking for Exegol.

312
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,772
Of course you are.

313
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,734
Only two were made.

314
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,027
A Sith wayfinder.

315
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,654
Luke Skywalker came here to find one.

316
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,157
I know. I was with him.

317
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,160
Luke and I were tailing
an old Jedi hunter.

318
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,746
Ochi of Bestoon.

319
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,333
He was carrying a clue
that could lead to a wayfinder.

320
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,503
We followed his ship
halfway across the galaxy here.

321
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,005
When we got to his ship,
it was abandoned...

322
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,674
No clue.
No wayfinder.

323
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,343
Is Ochi's ship still here?

324
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,220
It's out in the desert,
where he left it.

325
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,680
We need to get to that ship.
Search it again.

326
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,274
I got a bad feeling about this.

327
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,069
Ochi's ship is out past Lurch Canyon.

328
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:53,862
- Go.
- Thank you, General.

329
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,323
You too, Chewie.

330
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,117
Leia needs pilots, General.

331
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,036
My flying days are long gone.

332
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,704
But do me a favor...

333
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,958
give Leia my love.

334
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,377
You should give it to her yourself.

335
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,628
Thank you.

336
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,263
There! Those speeders.

337
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,024
How do you know how to do that?

338
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,026
No need to worry. I made it.

339
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,905
We gotta go.

340
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,371
We've spotted the fugitives.

341
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,310
They fly now!

342
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,686
They fly now?

343
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:09,438
They fly now.

344
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,755
Did we lose them?

345
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,590
- Looks like it!
- Excellent job, sir!

346
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,261
Terrible job, sir!

347
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,768
Not now, BB-8.

348
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,824
Never underestimate a droid.

349
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:23,845
Poe!

350
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,768
Yeah!

351
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,144
Right, ho!

352
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,410
Ochi's ship.

353
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,329
I've seen that ship before.

354
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,414
Rey!

355
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,707
You get all of them?

356
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,605
What the hell is this?

357
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,568
Sinking fields! Try to grab something!

358
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,987
Will this agony ever end?

359
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,530
Come on!

360
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,574
BB-8! No!

361
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,616
Rey.

362
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,035
Rey, I never told you...

363
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,828
What? Finn!

364
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:43,842
General.

365
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,094
We're getting reports of a raid
at the Festival of Ancestors.

366
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,972
This mission is everything.
We cannot fail.

367
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,766
Any word from Rey?

368
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,017
Falcon's not responding.

369
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:53,977
Do you have to say it like that?

370
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,228
Like what?

371
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,731
Do me a personal favor?
Be optimistic.

372
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,358
Yes, ma'am.

373
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,401
This is terrific.

374
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,403
You're not gonna believe
how well this is gonna turn out.

375
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,780
It's gonna be great.

376
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,623
Rey! Finn!

377
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,042
You didn't say my name, sir,
but I'm all right.

378
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,257
- You all right?
- Yeah.

379
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,300
Where's Finn?

380
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,468
Where's Chewie?

381
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,554
I'm good.

382
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:30,889
Master Finn.

383
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,057
What is this place?

384
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,809
This isn't the afterlife, is it?

385
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,976
Are droids allowed here?

386
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,061
I thought we were goners.

387
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,354
We might still be.

388
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,855
Which way out?

389
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,655
We have to hurry.

390
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,740
- So, what was it?
- What?

391
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,867
- What you were gonna tell me?
- When?

392
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,327
When you were sinking in the sand,
you said...

393
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,787
"I never told you..."

394
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,039
I'll tell you later.

395
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,416
You mean when Poe's not here?

396
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,167
Yeah.

397
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,461
We're gonna die in sand burrows
and we're all keeping secrets?

398
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,423
I'll tell you when you tell us
about all that shifty stuff you do.

399
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,342
I do not wanna know
what made these tunnels.

400
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,803
Judging by the circumference
of the tunnel walls...

401
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,179
I said I do not wanna know.

402
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,681
Not.

403
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:13,807
What's that?

404
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,142
- Is that a speeder?
- What?

405
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,309
An old one.

406
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,311
Perhaps we will find the driver.

407
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,814
Yep, BB-8, I think dead, too.

408
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:23,316
Oh, my. A hex charm.

409
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,317
A what?

410
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,820
A common emblem of Sith loyalists.

411
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:27,946
Sith.

412
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,239
This was Ochi's?

413
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,825
Luke sensed it.
Ochi never left this place.

414
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,120
- And he ended up down here.
- He was headed for his ship.

415
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,122
Same thing happened to us,
happened to him.

416
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,540
So, how did Ochi get out?

417
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:39,666
He didn't.

418
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,130
No, he didn't.

419
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,631
Bones.

420
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,049
I don't like bones.

421
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,552
Bones? Never a good sign.

422
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,889
Yeah, I see it.

423
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,153
Horrible things...

424
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,113
have happened with this.

425
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,323
There's writing on it.

426
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,825
Perhaps I can translate.

427
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:19,539
The location of the wayfinder,
has been inscribed upon this dagger.

428
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,250
It's the clue that Master Luke
was looking for.

429
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,919
- And?
- Where's the wayfinder?

430
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,838
I am afraid I cannot tell you.

431
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,299
20.3 fazillion languages,
you can't read that?

432
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:30,800
I have read it, sir.

433
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,054
I know exactly where the wayfinder is.

434
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:38,308
Unfortunately, it is written
in the runic language of the Sith.

435
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,518
So what?

436
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,853
My programming forbids me
from translating it.

437
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,731
So, you're telling us the one time
we need you to talk, you can't?

438
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,107
Irony, sir.

439
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:50,111
I am mechanically incapable
of speaking translations from Sith.

440
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:53,698
I believe the rule was passed
by the Senate of the Old Republic...

441
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,370
Serpent! Serpent! Serpent!

442
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,343
Rey.

443
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,602
Finn.

444
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,912
- I'm gonna blast it.
- Don't blast it.

445
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,055
I just transferred a bit of life.

446
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,724
Force energy from me to him.

447
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,185
You would've done the same.

448
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,417
We cannot possibly fly in
that old wreck.

449
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,585
We gotta keep moving.

450
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,587
Find someone
who can translate that dagger.

451
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:13,838
Like a helpful droid.

452
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,008
I suggest we return
to the Millennium Falcon at once.

453
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,426
They'll be waiting for us at the Falcon.

454
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,136
Yeah, they'll throw us
in the Pits of Griq.

455
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,847
Yeah.
And use you as a target droid.

456
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,850
You both make excellent points,
at times.

457
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,980
What is it?

458
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,525
I'll be right behind you.

459
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,402
It's okay.

460
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,621
Let's see what we got.

461
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,500
Let's get those converters fired up.

462
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,800
What a filthy ship!

463
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,553
Look at that.

464
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:03,847
Where is she?

465
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,729
Finn, help me out over here.

466
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,605
Chewie, tell Rey we gotta go.

467
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:02,864
What's she doing?

468
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,616
Where the hell's Chewie?

469
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,661
It's Ren.

470
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,512
All right, let's go.

471
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,472
Get in the transport.

472
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,723
Move, animal!

473
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,508
Rey!

474
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,176
Rey!

475
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,431
They got Chewie!
They got him!

476
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,416
Chewie!

477
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,584
No!

478
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,049
Rey!

479
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,303
We gotta go!
They're coming!

480
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,430
Rey, come on!

481
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,559
Rey!

482
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,438
- We gotta go!
- Chewie.

483
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,357
Rey, come on!

484
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,213
I lost control.

485
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,757
It wasn't your fault.

486
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,925
It was.

487
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,261
No. It was Ren.
He made you do it.

488
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,721
Chewie's gone.

489
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,265
That power came from me.

490
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,268
Finn, there are things you don't know.

491
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,354
Then tell me.

492
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:11,988
I had a vision.

493
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,492
Of the throne of the Sith.

494
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,495
And who was on it.

495
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,330
Ren?

496
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,209
And me.

497
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,102
We recovered the scavenger's ship,
but she got away.

498
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,355
Under command of the Knights of Ren,
we suffered losses.

499
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,775
- A transport was destroyed.
- I've seen the report.

500
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,485
That all?

501
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,653
No, Allegiant General.

502
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,447
There was another transport
in the desert.

503
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,117
It brought back a valuable prisoner.

504
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,370
Prisoner?

505
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,003
The beast used to fly with Han Solo.

506
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,216
Take it to Interrogation Six.

507
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,801
Move it.

508
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,304
We've only got eight hours left.
So, what are we gonna do?

509
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,014
What can we do?
We gotta go back to base.

510
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,058
We don't have time to go back.
We are not giving up.

511
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,726
If we do that,
Chewie died for nothing.

512
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,478
Poe, Chewie had the dagger!

513
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:26,813
- Well, then we gotta find another way.
- Well, there isn't.

514
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,232
That was the only clue
to the wayfinder thing, and it's gone.

515
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:32,819
So true. The inscription lives
only in my memory now.

516
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:35,905
Hold on.

517
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,283
The inscription that was on the dagger
is in your memory?

518
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,035
Yes, Master Poe.

519
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,287
But the translation
from a forbidden language

520
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,539
cannot be retrieved.

521
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,500
That is short
of a complete redacted memory bypass.

522
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:48,626
A complete what?

523
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,545
It's a terribly dangerous
and sinful act...

524
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,214
performed on unwitting droids
by dregs and criminals.

525
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,465
Let's do that.

526
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,384
I know a black market droidsmith.

527
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,386
- Black market droidsmith?
- But he's on Kijimi.

528
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,345
What's wrong with Kijimi?

529
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,305
I had a little bad luck on Kijimi.

530
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:06,018
But if this mission fails,
it's all been for nothing.

531
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,688
All we've done, all this time.

532
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,608
We're all in this.

533
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,319
Until the end.

534
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,741
For Chewie.

535
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,162
- Hands?
- Hands.

536
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,622
For Chewie.

537
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,628
Kijimi.

538
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,247
Battery charged.

539
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:10,583
Hello.

540
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:16,714
Hello.

541
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,883
- Hello.
- No, thank you.

542
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,596
Looks like someone treated him badly.

543
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,682
It's all right.
You're with us now.

544
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,569
U-A-T-T walker patrol,
head down thoroughfare 60.

545
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,087
Open up. You're wanted for questioning.

546
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,218
Check this side of the street.

547
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,641
Door is locked.
Move on to the next one.

548
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,269
Give me regular reports, please.

549
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,604
You, up against the wall.

550
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,356
Show me your identification.

551
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,358
Where is your identification?

552
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:20,027
They're everywhere.

553
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,238
Please, leave her alone.
She didn't do anything.

554
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,656
All right, I know what we should do.

555
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,241
So do I. We should leave.

556
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,742
Clam it, Threepio.

557
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,077
Follow me.

558
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,795
All right.
Let's head down this way.

559
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,590
Heard you were spotted at Monk's Gate.

560
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,427
Thought, "He's not stupid enough
to come back here."

561
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,053
You'd be surprised.

562
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,680
- Who's this?
- What's going on?

563
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,932
Guys, this is Zorii.
Zorii, this is Rey and Finn.

564
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,600
I could pull this trigger right now.

565
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,227
- I've seen you do worse.
- For a lot less.

566
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,896
Can we just... talk about this?

567
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:57,898
I wanna see your brains in the snow.

568
00:46:58,566 --> 00:46:59,775
So, you're still mad?

569
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,277
Zorii, we could use your help.

570
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,070
We gotta crack this droid's head open
and fast.

571
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,239
- Pardon me!
- We're trying to find Babu Frik.

572
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:06,657
Babu? Babu only works with the crew.

573
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,117
That's not you anymore.

574
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,243
What crew?

575
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,786
Funny he never mentioned it.

576
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,414
Your friend's old job was running spice.

577
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:14,623
You were a spice runner?

578
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,792
- You were a stormtrooper?
- Were you a spice runner?

579
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,377
Were you a scavenger?
We could do this all night.

580
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,670
You don't have all night.

581
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,256
You know, I'm still
digging out of the hole you put me in...

582
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,050
when you left to join the Resistance.

583
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:25,926
You.

584
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,595
You're the one they're looking for.

585
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,181
Bounty for her just might cover us.

586
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,807
- Djak'kankah!
- Don't djak'kankah.

587
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,067
We could really use your help.

588
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:42,485
Please.

589
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,488
Not that you care...

590
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,741
but I think you're okay.

591
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,659
I care.

592
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,665
- T-18's online yet?
- Yes, sir.

593
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,875
Scouting the perimeter.

594
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,545
Walkers. Stay close by.

595
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:06,801
Poe Dameron, spice runner.
Runner of spice.

596
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,511
- All right.
- Get your spice!

597
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,221
Come on, Threepio.

598
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,695
Babu's in the back.

599
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,290
Don't mind us.

600
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,965
I haven't the faintest idea
why I agreed to this.

601
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:49,510
I must be malfunctioning.

602
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,846
Babu Frik?

603
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,431
Can you help us with this?

604
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,063
Zorii?
Is this gonna work?

605
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:10,072
He says he's found something
in your droid's forbidden memory bank.

606
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,032
Words, translated from Sith.

607
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,034
- That's it.
- Yeah, that's what we need.

608
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,495
Who are you hanging out with
that speaks Sith?

609
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,205
Can you make him...

610
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,875
Babu, can you make him translate it?

611
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,005
Yes. But it will cause a complete...

612
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,756
A complete memory wipe.

613
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,592
Wait, wait, wait.
We make him translate it...

614
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,927
he won't remember... anything?

615
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,054
Droid, memory go blank.

616
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,222
Blank, blank.

617
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:36,432
There must be some other way.

618
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:37,975
Doesn't Artoo back up your memory?

619
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:41,979
Oh, please. Artoo's storage units
are famously unreliable.

620
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,398
You know the odds better than any of us.

621
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,818
Do we have a choice?

622
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,076
If this mission fails...

623
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,537
it was all for nothing.

624
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,415
All we've done...

625
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,876
all this time.

626
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,174
What are you doing there, Threepio?

627
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,886
Taking one last look, sir...

628
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,514
at my friends.

629
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:20,559
Sad.

630
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,483
Night raids are gonna start soon.
I'll keep lookout.

631
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,859
I'm coming with you.

632
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,861
You still don't trust me?

633
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,196
Did you ever trust me?

634
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,364
Nope.

635
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:40,246
Report, General Pryde.

636
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,664
There's been a development, sir.

637
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,749
The Knights of Ren
have tracked the scavenger.

638
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,543
To a settlement called Kijimi.

639
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,836
Shall we destroy the city, Supreme...?

640
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,805
I just had an idea.
There's something else we could try.

641
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,488
How long's it been like this?

642
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:17,700
First Order took most of the kids
a long time ago.

643
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,952
Can't stand the cries anymore.

644
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,037
I've saved up enough to get out.

645
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,330
I'm going to the Colonies.

646
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,374
How?
All those hyperlanes are blocked.

647
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:32,381
That's a First Order
Captain's medallion.

648
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,675
I've never seen a real one.

649
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,635
Free passage through any blockade.

650
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,512
Landing privileges, any vessel.

651
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,689
Wanna come with me?

652
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,448
I can't walk out on this war.

653
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,993
Not till it's over.

654
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,745
Maybe it is.

655
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,708
We sent out a call for help
at the Battle of Crait.

656
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,961
Nobody came.

657
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,130
Everyone's so afraid.

658
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,176
They've given up.

659
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,138
No, I don't believe you believe that.

660
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,351
Hey.

661
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:29,188
They win by making you think
you're alone.

662
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,149
Remember?

663
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,862
There's more of us.

664
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:42,159
Squeaky wheel.

665
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,578
I have a squeaky wheel.

666
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,335
Squeak eliminated.

667
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,337
Thank you.

668
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:54,797
Very kind.

669
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,722
Something's not right about all of this.

670
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,725
I know where I've seen it.

671
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,811
The ship he was on.
Ochi's ship.

672
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,187
What?

673
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,272
The day my parents left.

674
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,775
They were on that ship.

675
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,277
Are you sure?

676
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,655
There's an incoming Destroyer.

677
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,949
We gotta go now. Did we get it?
Babu?

678
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:25,035
Yep. Droid is ready!

679
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,543
The Emperor's wayfinder
is in the Imperial vault.

680
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:36,839
At delta 3-6, transient 9-3-6,
bearing 3-2...

681
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,507
on a moon in the Endor system.

682
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,467
From the southern shore.

683
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,428
Only this blade tells.

684
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,055
Only this blade tells.

685
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:50,561
The Endor system.

686
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,271
Where the last war ended?

687
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,654
Rey!

688
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,409
Ren's Destroyer.

689
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:06,577
He's here?

690
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,124
Chewie?

691
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,002
What about him?

692
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,920
He's on Ren's ship.

693
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,255
He's alive.

694
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,215
What? How?

695
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,384
He's alive! He must've been
on a different transport.

696
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:23,552
We gotta go get him.

697
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:24,928
Your friend's on that sky trash?

698
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,221
I guess he is.

699
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,723
Might I introduce myself.

700
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:32,269
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.
And you are?

701
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,479
Okay, that's gonna be a problem.

702
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,981
Hello. I Babu Frik.

703
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,524
Why, hello!

704
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,826
Threepio, move your metal ass.
We're almost there.

705
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,787
How dare you!
We've only just met.

706
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,121
Poe.

707
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,956
Might get you on a capital ship.

708
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:54,708
Go help your friend.

709
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,753
Zorii, I don't think I can take this.

710
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,379
I don't care what you think.

711
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,301
We have to go. Now.

712
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,512
- Come with us.
- Poe.

713
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,763
Can I kiss you?

714
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:08,680
Go.

715
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:15,896
We've done nothing wrong!

716
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,105
No sudden moves.

717
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,941
What is that? Stop moving.

718
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:34,790
Medallion's good.

719
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:37,167
Clear for entrance into hangar 12.

720
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,335
Hang on, Chewie.

721
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,503
We're coming.

722
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,339
Whoever this Chewie person is,
this is madness!

723
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,892
Credentials and manifest.

724
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,770
Close the blast doors.

725
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,817
- You three, stay there.
- Happily.

726
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:02,901
Which way?

727
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,403
No idea. Follow me.

728
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,593
Drop your weapons.

729
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,469
It's okay that we're here.

730
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,181
- It's okay that you're here.
- It's good.

731
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,349
You're relieved that we're here.

732
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,518
- Thank goodness you're here.
- Welcome, guys.

733
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,020
Does she do that to us?

734
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,439
We're looking for a prisoner
and his belongings.

735
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,400
The cameras.

736
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,364
They said Chewie's this way.

737
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:00,876
Rey, come on.

738
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,128
The dagger is on this ship.
We need it.

739
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,088
Why?

740
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:08,842
A feeling.
I'll meet you back at the hangar.

741
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:09,968
Rey, you can't just...

742
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,220
Chewie.

743
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,853
Search the city again.

744
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,607
She's close.

745
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,237
Of course we came for you, Chewie.

746
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,990
Yeah, Rey's here.
She's gonna get the dagger.

747
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,374
Whose ship is this?

748
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,167
The ship's this way.
Follow me.

749
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,961
Over here!

750
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:46,421
Wrong way!

751
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,132
There's not really a right way,
is there?

752
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:52,344
I found them.

753
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:54,888
Blast them!

754
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,102
Over here!

755
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,269
There they are. Get them!

756
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,662
- We close?
- Straight ahead.

757
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:19,830
Blast them!

758
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,500
Halt!

759
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:27,796
Poe!

760
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,259
Are you okay?

761
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:34,845
Nope.

762
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,722
You there, hands up!

763
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,348
Drop your weapons now!

764
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:39,975
Put your weapons down!

765
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,518
Drop them!

766
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,520
Drop them now!

767
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,566
- Hey, fellas.
- Shut up, scum.

768
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,108
No!

769
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,069
No!

770
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:33,445
No.

771
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:34,654
Rey.

772
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,034
Wherever you are...

773
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:40,535
you are hard to find.

774
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,537
You're hard to get rid of.

775
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,584
I pushed you in the desert,
because I needed to see it.

776
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,378
I needed you to see it.

777
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,547
Who you are.

778
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,759
I know the rest of your story.

779
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:58,887
Rey.

780
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,057
You're lying.

781
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:04,351
I never lied to you.

782
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,520
Your parents were no one.

783
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,439
They chose to be.

784
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:11,817
To keep you safe.

785
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:12,734
Don't!

786
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:14,486
You remember more than you say.

787
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,279
I've been in your head.

788
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:17,322
I don't want this!

789
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,532
Search your memories.

790
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,366
No!

791
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,955
Remember them.

792
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:26,748
See them.

793
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,003
My love. Rey, be brave.

794
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,049
You'll be safe here.

795
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,009
I promise.

796
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,221
Come back!

797
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:42,180
No!

798
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:51,064
They sold you to protect you.

799
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,274
Stop talking.

800
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,401
Rey, I know what happened to them.

801
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,452
Move it.

802
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:08,123
Allegiant General,
the scavenger is not with them.

803
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:10,667
Take them away. Terminate them.

804
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,757
Tell me where you are.

805
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,218
You don't know the whole story.

806
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,517
It was Palpatine
who had your parents taken.

807
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,478
He was looking for you.

808
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,690
But they wouldn't say
where you were.

809
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,318
So he gave the order.

810
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:42,490
She isn't on Jakku.
She's gone.

811
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:44,409
No!

812
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:46,870
No!

813
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,131
So that's where you are.

814
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,264
You know why the Emperor's always
wanted you dead.

815
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,390
No.

816
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,351
I'll come tell you.

817
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:18,443
She was in my quarters.
Lock down the ship.

818
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,573
Actually...

819
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,660
I'd like to do this myself.

820
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,707
What were you gonna tell Rey before?

821
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,793
You still on that?

822
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,045
I'm sorry, is this a bad time?

823
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:38,964
Yeah. Sort of is a bad time, Poe.

824
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,132
Well, 'cause later doesn't really
look like an option.

825
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,175
If you're gonna
let something off your chest,

826
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,760
maybe now's not the worst time to...

827
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,015
I'm the spy.

828
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,892
- What?
- You?

829
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,352
We don't have much time.

830
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:53,603
I knew it.

831
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,729
No, you did not.

832
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,273
What's your operating number?

833
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,109
That's not even a language.

834
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,615
Oh, dear! My first laser battle.

835
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,784
- Where are the others?
- They haven't come back.

836
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:15,375
Find them.

837
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:16,793
- Go.
- Yes.

838
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,465
Friends ahead.

839
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,342
Yes, there they are!

840
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:25,343
BB-8, come on!

841
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,178
I'll shut down the impeders.
You've got seconds.

842
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,847
There she is.

843
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,265
She's a survivor.

844
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:32,058
Wait. Wait.

845
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,019
- Blast me in the arm. Quick.
- What?

846
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,186
Or they'll know.

847
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,189
No!

848
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:40,900
Why are you helping us?

849
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,862
I don't care if you win.

850
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,823
I need Kylo Ren to lose.

851
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,601
Why did the Emperor come for me?

852
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,645
Why did he want to kill a child?

853
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:19,939
Tell me.

854
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:22,525
Because he saw
what you would become.

855
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,445
You don't just have power.

856
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,115
You have his power.

857
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,408
You're his granddaughter.

858
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:35,413
You are a Palpatine.

859
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:45,840
My mother was the daughter of Vader.

860
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,009
Your father was the son of the Emperor.

861
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:53,473
What Palpatine doesn't know is
we're a dyad in the Force, Rey.

862
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,767
Two that are one.

863
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:08,029
We'll kill him together
and take the throne.

864
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,915
You know what you need to do.

865
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,334
You know.

866
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,719
I do.

867
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:40,145
Hold her steady.

868
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,151
Finn, move fast!

869
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,736
Rey!

870
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,488
Come on!

871
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,327
Come on! I got you!

872
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:08,006
It was a coordinated incursion,
Allegiant General.

873
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:11,092
They overpowered the guards and
forced me to take them to their ship.

874
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,219
I see.

875
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:15,138
Get me the Supreme Leader.

876
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:16,097
Yes, sir.

877
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,437
Tell him we found our spy.

878
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,066
I don't know
why they're not following us,

879
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,234
but I don't trust it.

880
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:31,112
Landing gear's busted? How busted?

881
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:35,742
All that matters is the wayfinder.
Finding Exegol.

882
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,410
That's what we're doing.

883
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,042
He killed my mother.

884
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,337
And my father.

885
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,508
I'm going to find Palpatine...

886
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,344
and destroy him.

887
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,138
Rey...

888
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,224
that doesn't sound like you.

889
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:03,269
Rey, I know you...

890
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,188
People keep telling me they know me.

891
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,525
I'm afraid no one does.

892
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:17,242
The Jedi apprentice still lives.

893
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:22,121
Perhaps you have betrayed me.

894
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:26,584
Do not make me
turn my fleet against you.

895
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:30,004
I know where she's going.
She'll never be a Jedi.

896
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:31,673
Make sure of it.

897
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,007
Kill her.

898
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:16,884
What is that?

899
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,261
It's the Death Star.

900
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:21,097
A bad place from an old war.

901
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,267
It's gonna take us years
to find what we're looking for.

902
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,852
Oh, dear.

903
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,479
"Only this blade tells."

904
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,432
The wayfinder's there.

905
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:06,309
Heads up.

906
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:14,901
Rough landing.

907
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:17,403
- I've seen worse.
- I've seen better.

908
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,782
Are you Resistance?

909
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,033
That depends.

910
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:25,036
We picked up a transmission
from someone named Babu Frik.

911
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:28,081
Babu Frik?
He's one of my oldest friends.

912
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,041
He said you'd come.

913
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,959
He said you were the last hope.

914
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,338
We have to get to that wreck.

915
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,090
There is something inside there we need.

916
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:38,758
I can take you there by water.

917
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:40,551
- Have you seen the water?
- Not now.

918
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:41,803
Too dangerous.

919
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:43,596
We can go first light tomorrow.

920
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:45,973
We can't wait that long.
We don't have the time.

921
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,142
Or the choice.

922
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,103
Let's get that ship fixed.

923
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:51,771
Do you have any spare parts?

924
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:52,939
Some.

925
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,565
- I'm Jannah.
- I'm Poe.

926
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:05,576
Hello.

927
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,622
No, thank you. No, thank you.

928
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,291
What a dreadful situation.

929
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,335
Is every day like this for you people?

930
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:15,795
Madness.

931
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,964
Did we ever find his volume control?

932
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,675
It's an O-6, but should work.

933
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:22,301
Thank you.

934
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,222
This is a First Order part.

935
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:28,307
There's an old cruiser
on the west ridge.

936
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:29,308
Stripped for parts.

937
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,978
The one we were assigned to.

938
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:33,896
The one we escaped in.

939
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:37,692
Okay, wait.
You were First Order?

940
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:38,901
Not by choice.

941
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:44,323
We were conscripted as kids.
All of us.

942
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:48,077
I was TZ-1719. Stormtrooper.

943
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,495
FN-2187.

944
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,581
You?

945
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:52,957
I never knew there were more.

946
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:56,085
Deserters?
All of us here were stormtroopers.

947
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:59,213
We mutinied
at the battle of Ansett Island.

948
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,592
They told us to fire on civilians.
We wouldn't do it.

949
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,469
We laid our weapons down.

950
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,429
- All of you?
- The whole company.

951
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,974
I don't even know how it happened.

952
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,770
It wasn't a decision, really,
it was like...

953
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:14,979
An instinct.

954
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,148
Feeling.

955
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,150
A feeling.

956
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,611
The Force.

957
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,946
The Force brought me here.

958
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,867
It brought me to Rey.
And Poe.

959
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:31,204
You say that like you're sure it's real.

960
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:33,372
It's real.

961
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,583
I wasn't sure then...

962
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,045
but I am now.

963
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:41,547
What is it, buddy?

964
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:45,593
What do you mean you haven't seen her?

965
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,360
She took the skimmer?

966
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:38,688
What the hell was she thinking?

967
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:40,731
Poe, we gotta go after her.

968
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,483
We'll get the Falcon fixed,
and get out there as fast as we can.

969
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:43,901
No, we're gonna lose her.

970
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:45,903
Look, she left us!
What do you wanna do? Swim?

971
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,072
She's not herself.
You have no idea what she's fighting.

972
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:49,657
And you do?

973
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,286
Yeah, I do.

974
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:55,079
And so does Leia.

975
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:57,707
Well, I'm not Leia.

976
01:12:58,291 --> 01:12:59,667
That's for damn sure.

977
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:24,400
Finn.

978
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,652
There's another skimmer.

979
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:19,116
Don't be afraid of who you are.

980
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:54,944
Look at yourself.

981
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,572
You wanted to prove to my mother
that you were a Jedi...

982
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:00,241
but you've proven something else.

983
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:05,663
You can't go back to her now.

984
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:08,958
Like I can't.

985
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:12,294
Give it to me.

986
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:18,843
The dark side is in our nature.

987
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:23,305
Surrender to it.

988
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:25,349
Give it...

989
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:26,976
to me.

990
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,986
The only way you're getting to Exegol
is with me.

991
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:39,613
No!

992
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:15,983
Leia knows what must be done, Artoo.

993
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,069
To reach her son now...

994
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:22,615
will take all the strength
she has left.

995
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:44,178
Rey!

996
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,806
Rey!

997
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:50,643
No!

998
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:25,886
No, we can't follow them!

999
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,888
- I can't leave her!
- We can't!

1000
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,057
Rey!

1001
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:09,865
Ben.

1002
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,146
Leia.

1003
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:01,643
I did want to take your hand.

1004
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,730
Ben's hand.

1005
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:50,067
Goodbye, dear princess.

1006
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,789
Poe, something's happened.

1007
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:05,499
- Finn.
- This can't wait.

1008
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:07,334
We've gotta see the General.

1009
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,295
She's gone.

1010
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:17,719
Chewie...

1011
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:44,580
Hey, kid.

1012
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:06,935
I miss you, son.

1013
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,398
Your son is dead.

1014
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:13,734
No.

1015
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:20,949
Kylo Ren is dead.

1016
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:24,828
My son is alive.

1017
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,835
You're just a memory.

1018
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,088
Your memory.

1019
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:40,719
Come home.

1020
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,388
It's too late.

1021
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:47,726
She's gone.

1022
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,438
Your mother's gone.

1023
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:55,400
But what she stood for,
what she fought for...

1024
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,362
that's not gone.

1025
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:06,119
Ben.

1026
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,080
I know what I have to do...

1027
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:10,374
but I don't know if I have
the strength to do it.

1028
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:22,469
You do.

1029
01:26:33,647 --> 01:26:34,856
Dad...

1030
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,072
I know.

1031
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:06,763
The Princess of Alderaan
has disrupted my plan...

1032
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:10,976
but her foolish act will be in vain.

1033
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:15,355
Come to me on Exegol, General Pryde.

1034
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:21,695
As I served you in the old wars,
I serve you now.

1035
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:26,116
Send a ship to a world they know.

1036
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:28,618
Let it burn.

1037
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,496
The Final Order begins.

1038
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:35,751
She will come,
her friends will follow.

1039
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,502
Yes, my lord.

1040
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:50,724
Levels holding steady at 85%.

1041
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:53,059
Captain.

1042
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:56,438
- Kijimi is in range.
- Fire.

1043
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:18,460
Kijimi? How?

1044
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:21,254
A blast from a Star Destroyer.

1045
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:24,424
A ship from the new Sith fleet.

1046
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:26,009
Out of the Unknowns.

1047
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,553
The Emperor sent a ship from Exegol.

1048
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,347
Does that mean
every ship in the fleet...

1049
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,766
Has planet-killing weapons.
Of course they do.

1050
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:34,559
All of them.

1051
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:36,812
This is how he finishes it.

1052
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:37,979
Listen.

1053
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,315
It's on every frequency.

1054
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:43,693
"The Resistance is dead.

1055
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,112
"The Sith flame will burn.

1056
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:49,574
"All worlds, surrender or die.

1057
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:52,369
"The Final Order begins."

1058
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:54,704
Leia made you acting general.

1059
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:57,541
What now?

1060
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:08,218
I gotta tell you,
I don't really know...

1061
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:10,720
how to do this.

1062
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:13,890
What you did...

1063
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:17,352
I'm not ready.

1064
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:20,272
Neither were we.

1065
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:25,819
Luke, Han, Leia, me...

1066
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:27,904
Who's ever ready?

1067
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:29,739
How'd you do it?

1068
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:34,661
Defeat an empire with almost nothing.

1069
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:36,454
We had each other.

1070
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,332
That's how we won.

1071
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:44,671
Hey, don't touch that.
That's my friend's.

1072
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:46,673
Sorry. She is gone?

1073
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:48,758
Yeah, she's gone.

1074
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:50,010
I don't know where.

1075
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:52,095
I miss her.

1076
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:53,638
I miss her, too.

1077
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,184
So, what's your name?

1078
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:00,770
- I gotta talk to you about something.
- I gotta talk to you about something.

1079
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:02,272
I can't do this alone.

1080
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:03,690
I need you in command with me.

1081
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:05,942
This droid has...
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1082
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:07,235
- General.
- General.

1083
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,446
This droid has a ton of information
about Exegol.

1084
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:10,822
- Wait, what? Cone-face?
- I am D-O.

1085
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,157
Sorry, D-O.

1086
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:14,618
He was going to Exegol
with Ochi of Bestoon.

1087
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,202
Why was Ochi going there?

1088
01:30:16,286 --> 01:30:19,831
To bring the little girl he was supposed
to take from Jakku to the Emperor.

1089
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:22,000
He wanted her alive.

1090
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:15,595
A Jedi's weapon deserves more respect.

1091
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:19,516
Master Skywalker.

1092
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,686
What are you doing?

1093
01:31:23,103 --> 01:31:25,271
I saw myself on the dark throne.

1094
01:31:25,772 --> 01:31:27,357
I won't let it happen.

1095
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:29,901
I'm never leaving this place.
I'm doing what you did.

1096
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:32,487
I was wrong.

1097
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:36,157
It was fear that kept me here.

1098
01:31:37,784 --> 01:31:39,411
What are you most afraid of?

1099
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,041
Myself.

1100
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:49,963
Because you're a Palpatine.

1101
01:31:52,382 --> 01:31:54,092
Leia knew it, too.

1102
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,594
She didn't tell me.

1103
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,603
She still trained me.

1104
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:09,024
Because she saw your spirit.

1105
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:11,026
Your heart.

1106
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:14,946
Rey.

1107
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:18,575
Some things are stronger than blood.

1108
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:22,746
Confronting fear
is the destiny of a Jedi.

1109
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:24,748
Your destiny.

1110
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,833
If you don't face Palpatine...

1111
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,335
it will mean the end of the Jedi.

1112
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:32,672
And the war will be lost.

1113
01:32:36,509 --> 01:32:39,220
There's something
my sister would want you to have.

1114
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:56,279
Leia's saber.

1115
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:00,450
It was the last night of her training.

1116
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:21,262
Leia told me that she had sensed
the death of her son

1117
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:23,348
at the end of her Jedi path.

1118
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:27,894
She surrendered her saber to me
and said that one day...

1119
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:30,605
it would be picked up again...

1120
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:33,650
by someone who would finish her journey.

1121
01:33:35,735 --> 01:33:39,072
A thousand generations live in you now.

1122
01:33:40,156 --> 01:33:42,200
But this is your fight.

1123
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:45,912
You'll take both sabers to Exegol.

1124
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:49,624
I can't get there.

1125
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:52,544
I don't have the wayfinder.
I destroyed Ren's ship.

1126
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:55,130
You have everything you need.

1127
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:06,850
Two were made.

1128
01:35:04,032 --> 01:35:08,077
Hello. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1129
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:09,662
And you are?

1130
01:35:10,455 --> 01:35:11,456
What?

1131
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:16,711
Well, I am quite certain
I would remember if I had a best friend.

1132
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:21,424
You want to put what in my head?
Under no circumstances...

1133
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:26,888
Memory restoration complete.

1134
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:29,182
Artoo, have you heard?

1135
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:32,101
I am going with Mistress Rey
on her very first mission.

1136
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:34,896
I already have?

1137
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:38,149
Picking up a signal?
From whom?

1138
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,616
All the information you need
for an airstrike on Exegol.

1139
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:47,825
Yeah, except how to get there.

1140
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:49,953
- Are you seeing these atmo readings?
- It's a mess out there.

1141
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:51,162
Magnetic crossfields.

1142
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:52,914
Gravity wells, solar winds.

1143
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:54,207
How does a fleet
even take off from there?

1144
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:55,208
Terribly sorry.

1145
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:56,709
I'm afraid Artoo's memory bank

1146
01:35:56,793 --> 01:35:58,878
must be crossed
with his logic receptors.

1147
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:03,675
He says he is receiving a transmission
from Master Luke.

1148
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:06,052
That's an old craft ID.

1149
01:36:07,136 --> 01:36:08,930
That's Luke Skywalker's X-wing.

1150
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:12,934
It's transmitting course marker signals
on its way to the Unknown Regions.

1151
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:14,227
It's Rey.

1152
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,441
She's going to Exegol.

1153
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:26,614
She's showing us.

1154
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:28,366
She's showing us how to get there.

1155
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:31,953
Then we go together.

1156
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:39,627
Come on, buddy, we need you.

1157
01:36:40,837 --> 01:36:44,340
As long as those Star Destroyers
are on Exegol we can hit them.

1158
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:45,591
Hit them how?

1159
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:48,303
They can't activate their shields
until they leave atmosphere.

1160
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:51,681
Which isn't easy on Exegol.
Ships that size need help taking off.

1161
01:36:51,848 --> 01:36:53,474
Nav can't tell which way's up out there.

1162
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:54,892
So, how do the ships take off?

1163
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:58,313
They use a signal
from a navigation tower, like this one.

1164
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:00,356
Except they won't.

1165
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:02,859
Air team's gonna find the tower,
ground team's gonna blast it.

1166
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:04,986
- Ground team?
- I have an idea for that.

1167
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:06,988
Once the tower's down,
the fleet will be stuck in atmo...

1168
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:09,782
for just minutes, with no shields,
and no way out.

1169
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:12,618
We think hitting the cannons
might ignite the main reactors.

1170
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:14,704
That's our chance.

1171
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:17,498
We need to pull some Holdo maneuvers.
Do some real damage.

1172
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:19,250
Come on. That move is one in a million.

1173
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:22,045
Fighters and freighters can take out
their cannons if there are enough of us.

1174
01:37:22,211 --> 01:37:23,796
There aren't enough of us!

1175
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:26,132
He's right.
We'd be no more than bugs to them.

1176
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:27,759
That's where Lando and Chewie come in.

1177
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:30,511
They'll take the Falcon
to the Core Systems.

1178
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:32,847
Send out a call for help
for anybody listening.

1179
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:34,265
We've got friends out there.

1180
01:37:34,432 --> 01:37:35,683
They'll come if they know there's hope.

1181
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:38,644
They will.

1182
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:42,398
First Order wins by making us think
we're alone.

1183
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:44,442
We're not alone.

1184
01:37:45,151 --> 01:37:47,612
Good people will fight if we lead them.

1185
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:52,575
Leia never gave up.

1186
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:54,869
And neither will we.

1187
01:37:55,912 --> 01:37:57,914
We're gonna show them
we're not afraid.

1188
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:04,754
What our mothers and fathers
fought for...

1189
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:06,964
we will not let die.

1190
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:10,718
Not today.

1191
01:38:12,178 --> 01:38:14,722
Today, we make our last stand.

1192
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:17,016
For the galaxy.

1193
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:20,269
For Leia.

1194
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:24,732
For everyone we've lost.

1195
01:38:26,025 --> 01:38:27,735
They've taken enough of us.

1196
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:30,738
Now we take the war to them.

1197
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:59,016
She's on approach.

1198
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:01,644
All ships rise to deployment altitude.

1199
01:39:41,893 --> 01:39:43,186
I know it's a rough ride...

1200
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:45,062
but stay locked on Rey's course.

1201
01:39:51,944 --> 01:39:53,488
Clear run frequency.

1202
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,573
Captain, we have
Resistance craft incoming.

1203
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:56,991
Allegiant General...

1204
01:39:57,158 --> 01:39:58,409
Use ion cannons!

1205
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:05,166
Look at that fleet.

1206
01:40:08,628 --> 01:40:09,462
Damn it!

1207
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:12,548
Welcome to Exegol.

1208
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:17,428
Watch your starboard, Wexley!

1209
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:20,681
Get to their altitude.

1210
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,725
They can't fire on us
without hitting each other.

1211
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:24,936
Don't give up.

1212
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:26,771
Help is coming.

1213
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:29,232
There it is.

1214
01:40:29,398 --> 01:40:30,983
Poe, I see it.

1215
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:32,276
I've got a visual on the tower.

1216
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:22,159
Incoming TIEs!

1217
01:41:22,326 --> 01:41:23,160
I see 'em!

1218
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:24,161
I got you, Finn.

1219
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,459
- You ready back there?
- Never been readier.

1220
01:41:33,129 --> 01:41:34,797
They're targeting
the navigation tower...

1221
01:41:34,964 --> 01:41:36,090
so the fleet can't deploy.

1222
01:41:36,257 --> 01:41:37,258
Then we won't use that tower.

1223
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:40,636
Switch over the source
of navigation signal to this ship.

1224
01:41:40,803 --> 01:41:42,471
We'll guide the fleet out ourselves.

1225
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:50,605
The navigation tower
has been deactivated.

1226
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:52,732
- What?
- Those ships need that signal.

1227
01:41:52,898 --> 01:41:53,983
It's gotta be coming from somewhere.

1228
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:56,027
They figured out what we're doing.

1229
01:41:56,193 --> 01:41:58,070
Call off the ground invasion.

1230
01:41:58,237 --> 01:41:59,155
Wait.

1231
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:02,617
The nav signal's coming
from that command ship.

1232
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,327
That's our drop zone.

1233
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:05,661
How do you know?

1234
01:42:06,662 --> 01:42:07,580
A feeling.

1235
01:42:07,747 --> 01:42:10,541
You wanna launch a ground invasion
on a Star Destroyer?

1236
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:13,377
I don't want to, but we can't take out
that ship's nav system from the air.

1237
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:14,545
Give us cover.

1238
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:16,172
We gotta keep that fleet there
till help arrives.

1239
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:17,590
- We hope.
- We hope.

1240
01:42:18,924 --> 01:42:20,176
You heard the General.

1241
01:42:20,343 --> 01:42:22,845
All Wings, cover that lander.

1242
01:42:27,683 --> 01:42:29,727
They've landed a troop carrier.

1243
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:31,604
- Jam the speeders.
- I can't, sir.

1244
01:42:31,771 --> 01:42:32,688
Why not?

1245
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:34,940
They're not using speeders.

1246
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:42,156
Not bad for one lesson.

1247
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:44,700
You had a good teacher!

1248
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:53,250
Keep going!

1249
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:00,383
You're doing great, buddy!

1250
01:43:00,549 --> 01:43:02,051
The tower's up ahead.

1251
01:44:06,782 --> 01:44:09,618
Long have I waited.

1252
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:23,632
For my grandchild to come home.

1253
01:44:25,968 --> 01:44:28,679
I never wanted you dead.

1254
01:44:28,763 --> 01:44:30,973
I wanted you here...

1255
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:33,684
Empress Palpatine.

1256
01:44:36,228 --> 01:44:38,105
You will take the throne.

1257
01:44:40,816 --> 01:44:44,528
It is your birthright to rule here.

1258
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:49,074
It is in your blood.
Our blood.

1259
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:52,870
I haven't come to lead the Sith...

1260
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:55,372
I have come to end them.

1261
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:57,249
As a Jedi?

1262
01:44:57,625 --> 01:44:59,960
- Yes.
- No.

1263
01:45:00,169 --> 01:45:03,506
Your hatred, your anger.

1264
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:06,592
You want to kill me.

1265
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:09,970
That is what I want.

1266
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:13,015
Kill me...

1267
01:45:13,182 --> 01:45:16,352
and my spirit will pass into you.

1268
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:20,022
As all the Sith live in me...

1269
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:22,983
you will be Empress...

1270
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:25,569
we will be one.

1271
01:45:33,285 --> 01:45:35,287
Those thrusters are hot.
How are we doing?

1272
01:45:35,371 --> 01:45:37,665
We're gonna blow our way in,
and take out that nav tower.

1273
01:45:37,832 --> 01:45:39,083
All the hatches are blast-proof!

1274
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:40,626
All right, BB-8, you're up!

1275
01:45:40,793 --> 01:45:42,086
I'll cover you.

1276
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:11,657
This should do it.

1277
01:46:23,836 --> 01:46:25,004
There it goes.

1278
01:46:26,589 --> 01:46:27,965
Nice one, Finn.

1279
01:46:28,132 --> 01:46:30,050
Nav signal's down, but not for long.

1280
01:46:30,134 --> 01:46:31,427
We're offline, sir.

1281
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:34,013
Reset the navigation signal!

1282
01:46:34,096 --> 01:46:35,139
Minutes away, sir.

1283
01:46:36,974 --> 01:46:39,184
- Finn, let's go!
- No, no, wait, listen.

1284
01:46:39,351 --> 01:46:41,312
The crown cannons have stopped.
They're resetting their systems.

1285
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:44,106
- So?
- I gotta go do something.

1286
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:46,358
I'm staying with you.

1287
01:46:48,611 --> 01:46:50,029
Still no Falcon or backup.

1288
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:54,825
I don't know, Artoo.
Maybe nobody else is coming.

1289
01:46:54,909 --> 01:46:55,910
What do we do, General?

1290
01:46:57,161 --> 01:46:58,746
We gotta hit them ourselves.

1291
01:46:58,954 --> 01:47:00,039
What can we do against these things?

1292
01:47:00,122 --> 01:47:01,790
Just stay alive!

1293
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:06,295
The time has come!

1294
01:47:16,221 --> 01:47:19,683
With your hatred,
you will take my life.

1295
01:47:19,892 --> 01:47:21,769
And you will ascend.

1296
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:26,649
All you want is for me to hate,
but I won't.

1297
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:28,817
Not even you.

1298
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:33,072
Weak.
Like your parents.

1299
01:47:34,406 --> 01:47:36,075
My parents were strong.

1300
01:47:37,076 --> 01:47:38,994
They saved me from you.

1301
01:47:39,328 --> 01:47:43,666
Your Master, Luke Skywalker,
was saved by his father.

1302
01:47:43,832 --> 01:47:47,294
The only family you have here...

1303
01:47:47,836 --> 01:47:49,129
is me.

1304
01:48:10,526 --> 01:48:12,611
They don't have long.

1305
01:48:13,779 --> 01:48:16,532
No one is coming to help them.

1306
01:48:17,449 --> 01:48:21,161
And you are the one who led them here.

1307
01:48:22,579 --> 01:48:26,000
Strike me down.
Take the throne.

1308
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:28,210
Reign over the new Empire...

1309
01:48:28,377 --> 01:48:31,213
and the fleet will be yours.

1310
01:48:32,965 --> 01:48:36,802
Only you have the power to save them.

1311
01:48:39,096 --> 01:48:43,559
Refuse, and your new family...

1312
01:48:44,601 --> 01:48:46,395
dies.

1313
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:06,081
Good.

1314
01:49:21,805 --> 01:49:24,516
Finn, where are you?
The lander's leaving.

1315
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:27,644
- Finn!
- Go without us.

1316
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:29,480
We're taking this entire ship down.

1317
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:32,691
What? How?

1318
01:49:32,858 --> 01:49:34,276
We're gonna hit the command deck.

1319
01:49:35,194 --> 01:49:37,905
Rose, please.
Go.

1320
01:49:39,615 --> 01:49:40,616
- Rose!
- Rose!

1321
01:49:41,742 --> 01:49:43,285
I'll get the trigger!

1322
01:49:45,871 --> 01:49:48,248
The ritual begins.

1323
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:51,543
She will strike me down...

1324
01:49:52,044 --> 01:49:55,297
and pledge herself as a Sith.

1325
01:50:15,818 --> 01:50:18,112
She will draw her weapon.

1326
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:23,200
She will come to me.

1327
01:50:36,964 --> 01:50:39,466
She will take her revenge.

1328
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:48,392
And with a stroke of her saber...

1329
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:51,311
the Sith are reborn!

1330
01:50:52,604 --> 01:50:55,315
The Jedi are dead!

1331
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:17,796
Do it!

1332
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:20,090
Make the sacrifice!

1333
01:52:29,701 --> 01:52:33,038
Stand together, die together.

1334
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:45,676
The lifeforce of your bond...

1335
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:51,598
a dyad in the Force.

1336
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:54,893
A power like life itself.

1337
01:52:55,852 --> 01:52:59,356
Unseen for generations.

1338
01:52:59,523 --> 01:53:01,149
And now...

1339
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:07,781
the power of two restores
the one, true Emperor.

1340
01:53:29,553 --> 01:53:31,346
- Snap, they're on your tail.
- Yeah, I see 'em!

1341
01:53:31,513 --> 01:53:33,515
No, no, no, Snap, Snap!

1342
01:53:34,308 --> 01:53:35,517
No!

1343
01:53:37,519 --> 01:53:39,646
Alpha Three is down.

1344
01:53:40,063 --> 01:53:42,316
They're on my tail! I can't get...

1345
01:53:42,482 --> 01:53:43,984
They're everywhere!

1346
01:53:45,777 --> 01:53:47,362
Delta leader's hit!

1347
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:49,323
Losing altitude!

1348
01:53:49,406 --> 01:53:50,824
General, what's our next move?

1349
01:53:51,533 --> 01:53:53,368
Poe, what now?

1350
01:53:53,535 --> 01:53:54,786
My friends...

1351
01:53:57,289 --> 01:53:58,498
I'm sorry.

1352
01:53:59,833 --> 01:54:01,335
I thought we had a shot.

1353
01:54:03,211 --> 01:54:04,963
But there's just too many of them.

1354
01:54:06,173 --> 01:54:07,966
But there are more of us, Poe.

1355
01:54:08,717 --> 01:54:10,510
There are more of us.

1356
01:54:21,563 --> 01:54:22,981
Look at this.

1357
01:54:23,607 --> 01:54:25,150
Look at this.

1358
01:54:34,034 --> 01:54:36,787
Lando, you did it.
You did it!

1359
01:54:39,247 --> 01:54:43,001
Hit those underbelly cannons.
Every one we knock out is a world saved.

1360
01:54:46,171 --> 01:54:47,381
Nice flying, Lando.

1361
01:54:57,849 --> 01:54:59,476
We have a ship down.
We've lost a Destroyer.

1362
01:54:59,643 --> 01:55:00,977
Systems not responding.

1363
01:55:01,144 --> 01:55:02,229
Where did they get
all these fighter craft?

1364
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:03,188
They have no navy.

1365
01:55:03,355 --> 01:55:06,400
It's not a navy, sir, it's just people.

1366
01:55:17,411 --> 01:55:19,204
So long, sky trash!

1367
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:20,455
Who's that flyer?

1368
01:55:20,622 --> 01:55:22,707
Take a guess, spice runner.

1369
01:55:25,627 --> 01:55:27,629
Zorii! You made it!

1370
01:55:40,392 --> 01:55:43,520
Look what you have made.

1371
01:56:03,248 --> 01:56:05,792
As once I fell...

1372
01:56:05,959 --> 01:56:10,088
so falls the last Skywalker.

1373
01:56:17,471 --> 01:56:20,849
Do not fear that feeble attack...

1374
01:56:21,016 --> 01:56:22,601
my faithful.

1375
01:56:23,393 --> 01:56:27,105
Nothing will stop
the return of the Sith!

1376
01:56:38,992 --> 01:56:40,785
Artoo, my systems are failing.

1377
01:56:41,912 --> 01:56:43,121
Does anyone copy?

1378
01:57:24,621 --> 01:57:26,206
Be with me.

1379
01:57:31,044 --> 01:57:32,796
Be with me.

1380
01:57:38,426 --> 01:57:40,178
Be with me.

1381
01:57:43,765 --> 01:57:46,685
These are your final steps, Rey.

1382
01:57:46,851 --> 01:57:49,479
Rise and take them.

1383
01:57:49,938 --> 01:57:51,565
- Rey.
- Rey.

1384
01:57:51,731 --> 01:57:52,566
Rey.

1385
01:57:52,732 --> 01:57:54,901
Bring back the balance, Rey,
as I did.

1386
01:57:55,068 --> 01:57:57,404
In the night, find the light, Rey.

1387
01:57:57,571 --> 01:57:59,114
You're not alone, Rey.

1388
01:57:59,281 --> 01:58:01,366
Alone never have you been.

1389
01:58:01,533 --> 01:58:04,536
Every Jedi who ever lived
lives in you.

1390
01:58:04,703 --> 01:58:06,079
The Force surrounds you, Rey.

1391
01:58:06,246 --> 01:58:08,039
- Let it guide you.
- As it guided us.

1392
01:58:08,206 --> 01:58:10,417
Feel the Force flowing through you, Rey.

1393
01:58:10,584 --> 01:58:11,626
Let it lift you.

1394
01:58:11,793 --> 01:58:13,003
Rise, Rey.

1395
01:58:13,712 --> 01:58:15,255
We stand behind you, Rey.

1396
01:58:15,422 --> 01:58:16,256
Rey.

1397
01:58:16,423 --> 01:58:17,757
Rise in the Force.

1398
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:21,761
In the heart of a Jedi
lies her strength.

1399
01:58:22,721 --> 01:58:24,723
Rise.

1400
01:58:25,181 --> 01:58:30,270
Rey, the Force will be with you, always.

1401
01:58:48,747 --> 01:58:51,916
Let your death be the final word...

1402
01:58:52,083 --> 01:58:54,878
in the story of rebellion.

1403
01:59:06,056 --> 01:59:07,015
I'm back on!

1404
01:59:07,182 --> 01:59:10,101
This is our last chance.
We gotta hit those cannons now!

1405
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,442
You are nothing!

1406
01:59:17,609 --> 01:59:21,529
A scavenger girl is no match
for the power in me.

1407
01:59:24,908 --> 01:59:28,078
I am all the Sith!

1408
01:59:31,373 --> 01:59:33,083
And I...

1409
01:59:38,505 --> 01:59:40,382
I'm all the Jedi.

1410
02:00:30,849 --> 02:00:32,392
Poe, the command ship!

1411
02:00:33,977 --> 02:00:35,478
Their fleet is stuck here!

1412
02:00:35,645 --> 02:00:36,855
They're toast!
Come on!

1413
02:00:40,859 --> 02:00:42,277
Finn, you seeing this?

1414
02:00:42,444 --> 02:00:43,445
Finn didn't board the lander.

1415
02:00:44,195 --> 02:00:45,989
They're still on that command ship?

1416
02:00:56,708 --> 02:00:59,002
I see them.
I'm going to get them.

1417
02:00:59,753 --> 02:01:01,045
General, you won't make it.

1418
02:01:01,212 --> 02:01:02,464
Trust me, I'm fast!

1419
02:01:02,630 --> 02:01:04,466
Not as fast as this ship.

1420
02:01:07,385 --> 02:01:08,970
Hold on, Chewie!

1421
02:01:19,147 --> 02:01:20,732
Finn!

1422
02:01:55,975 --> 02:01:58,102
No, Rey.

1423
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:22,538
Ben.

1424
02:05:44,787 --> 02:05:46,289
There, look!

1425
02:05:47,206 --> 02:05:48,583
Red Five is in the air.

1426
02:05:48,666 --> 02:05:49,917
Rey's alive.

1427
02:05:51,711 --> 02:05:52,837
I see her.

1428
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:55,381
People are rising up
all over the galaxy.

1429
02:05:57,091 --> 02:05:59,135
Poe. We did it.

1430
02:05:59,302 --> 02:06:00,344
We did it.

1431
02:06:57,693 --> 02:06:58,694
Happy.

1432
02:07:02,824 --> 02:07:03,950
Chewie!

1433
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:35,773
Hi!

1434
02:07:35,940 --> 02:07:37,024
Good job!

1435
02:07:41,904 --> 02:07:43,114
Chewie.

1436
02:07:45,700 --> 02:07:47,577
This is for you.

1437
02:08:06,596 --> 02:08:07,722
Did you hear that?

1438
02:08:34,332 --> 02:08:36,042
Where are you from, General?

1439
02:08:36,209 --> 02:08:38,002
The Gold system.

1440
02:08:42,715 --> 02:08:44,008
Well, what about you, kid?

1441
02:08:46,344 --> 02:08:47,595
I don't know.

1442
02:08:49,805 --> 02:08:51,474
Well, let's find out.

1443
02:11:31,634 --> 02:11:33,928
There's been no one for so long.

1444
02:11:34,804 --> 02:11:36,305
Who are you?

1445
02:11:37,932 --> 02:11:39,350
I'm Rey.

1446
02:11:40,559 --> 02:11:41,685
Rey who?

1447
02:12:06,502 --> 02:12:07,878
Rey Skywalker.
