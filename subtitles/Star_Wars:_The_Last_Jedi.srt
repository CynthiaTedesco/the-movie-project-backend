1
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,207
We're not clear yet.

2
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,840
There are still 30 pallets
of cannon shells in C bunker.

3
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,760
Forget the munitions, there's no time.
Just get everyone on the transports.

4
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,082
Oh, no.

5
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,287
We've caught them in the middle
of their evacuation.

6
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,648
I have my orders from
Supreme Leader Snoke himself.

7
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,481
This is where we snuff out
the Resistance once and for all.

8
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,691
Tell Captain Canady to prime his dreadnought.

9
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,370
Incinerate their base, destroy their
transports and obliterate their fleet.

10
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,768
General, Resistance ship approaching.
Guns and shields in attack mode.

11
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,201
A single light fighter.

12
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,041
Happy beeps here, buddy, come on.

13
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,281
<i>We've pulled crazier stunts than this.</i>

14
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,125
Just for the record, Commander Dameron,
I'm with the droid on this one.

15
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,169
<i>Thank you for your support, General.</i>

16
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,480
Happy beeps.

17
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Attention.

18
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,529
This is Commander Poe Dameron
of the Republic fleet,

19
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,684
<i>I have an urgent communiqu√© for General Hugs.</i>

20
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,205
Patch him through.

21
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,046
This is General Hux of the First Order.

22
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,523
The Republic is no more.

23
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,923
Your fleet are Rebel scum and war criminals.

24
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,566
Tell your precious princess
there will be no terms,

25
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,246
there will be no surrender.

26
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,443
<i>Hi, I'm holding for General Hugs.</i>

27
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,570
This is Hux. You and your friends are doomed.

28
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,809
We will wipe your filth from the galaxy.

29
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,768
<i>Okay. I'll hold.</i>

30
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,441
Hello?

31
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,326
<i>Hello? Yup. I'm still here.</i>

32
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,810
Can he hear me?

33
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,200
- <i>Hugs?</i>
- He can.

34
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,603
<i>With an "H." Skinny guy. Kinda pasty.</i>

35
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,089
I can hear you. Can you hear me?

36
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,805
Look, I can't hold forever. If you reach him,

37
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,164
tell him Leia has
an urgent message for him...

38
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,607
I believe he's tooling with you, sir.

39
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,524
...<i>about his mother.</i>

40
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,400
Open fire!

41
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,040
BB-8, punch it!

42
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,320
He's going for the dreadnought.

43
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,401
Ha!

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,127
He's insane.

45
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,249
<i>Woo-hoo! That's got a kick.</i>

46
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,400
All right, taking out the cannons now.

47
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,560
<i>Tallie, start your approach.</i>

48
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,687
<i>Copy that.</i>

49
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,250
<i>Captain Canady,
why aren't you blasting that puny ship?</i>

50
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,211
That puny ship is too small
and at too close range.

51
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,725
We need to scramble our fighters

52
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,930
five bloody minutes ago.

53
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,286
He'll never penetrate our armor.

54
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,249
He's not trying to penetrate our armor.

55
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,408
He's clearing out our surface cannons.

56
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,000
<i>One cannon left.</i>

57
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,491
<i>And here comes the parade.</i>

58
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,121
<i>Yeah! Yeah, I see him!</i>

59
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,440
No, no, no. Damn it!

60
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,851
BB-8, my weapons systems are down.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,401
We gotta take out that last cannon
or our bombers are toast.

62
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,880
<i>Work your magic, buddy.</i>

63
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,965
Are the auto-cannons primed?

64
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,121
Primed and ready, sir.

65
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,486
What are we waiting for?

66
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,927
Fire on the base!

67
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,521
Punch it!

68
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,008
<i>The last transport is in the air.
The evacuation is complete.</i>

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,240
You did it, Poe.

70
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,640
Now get your squad back here
so we can get out of this place.

71
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,800
No, General...

72
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,450
<i>We can do this. We have the chance</i>

73
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,681
to take out a dreadnought.

74
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,324
<i>These things are fleet killers.</i>

75
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
<i>We can't let it get away.</i>

76
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,766
Disengage now...

77
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,730
<i>Commander. That is an or...</i>

78
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,643
Wipe that nervous expression
off your face, Threepio.

79
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,845
Oh. Well, I will certainly try, General.

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,161
Nervous?

81
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,325
Let's go, BB-8.

82
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,600
It's now or never!

83
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,408
<i>Yes!</i>

84
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,040
All clear! Bring the bombs.

85
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,121
Captain,

86
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,569
Resistance bombers approaching.

87
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,041
Of course they are.

88
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,485
<i>Bombers, keep that tight formation.</i>

89
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,688
<i>Fighters, protect the bombers.</i>

90
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,447
<i>It's not every day we get a shot at
a dreadnought, so let's make this count.</i>

91
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,607
Copy that, Blue Leader.

92
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,649
<i>You get us there, we'll give it to them.</i>

93
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,450
- <i>Copy. We're on it.</i>
- Fighters incoming.

94
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,405
<i>Gunners, look alive.</i>

95
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,680
<i>Snubfighters at two-ten!</i>

96
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,840
- <i>They're coming in!</i>
- <i>Form up!</i>

97
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,331
They're everywhere!

98
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,800
- <i>Here they come.</i>
- <i>Incoming fighters. Form up.</i>

99
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,240
<i>Vector in at attack speed.</i>

100
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,050
- <i>Pull up!</i>
- <i>Flank right.</i>

101
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,886
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! We're going down!</i>

102
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,442
Recharge the auto-cannons.

103
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,610
Target their cruiser.

104
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,322
I see it. Tallie, they've targeted the fleet

105
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,130
<i>and begun the priming sequence.</i>

106
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,327
<i>Copy that.</i>

107
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,481
<i>We're almost there.</i>

108
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,964
<i>Bombardiers, begin your drop sequence.</i>

109
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,004
<i>I've got a visual on the target.</i>

110
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,606
<i>We're approaching the sweet spot.</i>

111
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,205
<i>Bombs are armed.</i>

112
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,166
- Auto-cannons aimed.
- Forty seconds to full charge.

113
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,687
Destroy that last bomber!

114
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,485
Paige, come in. We're over the target.

115
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,807
<i>Why aren't your bay doors open?</i>

116
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,247
<i>You're the only bomber left.
It's all down to you!</i>

117
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,971
- Nix!
- <i>Paige!</i>

118
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,963
Drop the payload now!

119
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,321
Look out!

120
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,360
No!

121
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,361
<i>Bombs away!</i>

122
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,000
Direct hit! Dreadnought down!

123
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,248
General, Supreme Leader Snoke
is making contact from his ship.

124
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,801
Excellent.

125
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,571
I'll take it in my chambers.

126
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,760
<i>General Hux.</i>

127
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Ah, good. Supreme Lea...

128
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,920
<i>My disappointment</i>

129
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,528
<i>in your performance cannot be overstated.</i>

130
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,842
They can't get away, Supreme Leader.

131
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,208
We have them tied on the end of a string.

132
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,367
Rey!

133
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,400
Well done, pal.

134
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,203
"Finn naked leaking bag"?
What? Did you fry a chip?

135
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,290
Finn! Finn, buddy.

136
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,525
It's so good to see you.

137
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,727
What? Let's...

138
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,969
We need to get you dressed. Come on.

139
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,360
You must have a thousand questions.

140
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,806
Where's Rey?

141
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,410
Master Skywalker?

142
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,283
Master Skywalker?

143
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,570
I'm from the Resistance.

144
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,610
Your sister Leia sent me. We need your help.

145
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,044
Hello?

146
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,851
Go away.

147
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,131
Chewie, what are you doing here?

148
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,245
He said you're coming back with us.

149
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,401
How did you find me?

150
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,244
Long story. We'll tell you on the <i>Falcon.</i>

151
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,805
<i>Falcon?</i>

152
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,811
Wait.

153
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,043
Where's Han?

154
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,966
Tied on a string indeed,
General Hux. Well done.

155
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,329
The Resistance will soon be in our grasp.

156
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,727
Thank you, Supreme Leader.

157
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,130
You wonder why I keep a rabid cur

158
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,642
in such a place of power?

159
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,566
A cur's weakness, properly manipulated,

160
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,441
can be a sharp tool.

161
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,284
How's your wound?

162
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,641
<i>It's nothing.</i>

163
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,401
Hmm.

164
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,721
The mighty Kylo Ren.

165
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,290
When I found you,

166
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,051
I saw what all masters live to see.

167
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,091
Raw, untamed power.

168
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,690
And beyond that, something truly special.

169
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,966
The potential of your bloodline.

170
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,329
A new Vader.

171
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,566
Now I fear

172
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,891
I was mistaken.

173
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,646
<i>I've given everything I have to you.</i>

174
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,011
<i>To the dark side.</i>

175
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,084
Take that ridiculous thing off.

176
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,046
Yes, there it is.

177
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,880
You have too much
of your father's heart in you,

178
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,007
young Solo.

179
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,804
I killed Han Solo.

180
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,889
When the moment came, I didn't hesitate.

181
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,600
And look at you,

182
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,002
the deed split your spirit to the bone.

183
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,640
You were unbalanced,

184
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,527
bested by a girl
who had never held a lightsaber!

185
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,960
You failed!

186
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,571
Skywalker lives.

187
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,482
The seed of the Jedi Order lives.

188
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,529
And as long as it does,

189
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,002
hope lives in the galaxy.

190
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,445
I thought you would be the one
to snuff it out.

191
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,689
Alas, you're no Vader.

192
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,366
You're just a child

193
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,487
in a mask.

194
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,327
Prepare my ship.

195
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,044
<i>There's no light left in Kylo Ren.</i>

196
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,604
He's only getting stronger.

197
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,521
The First Order will control
all the major systems within weeks.

198
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,688
We need your help.

199
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,446
We need the Jedi Order back.

200
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,207
We need Luke Skywalker.

201
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,765
You don't need Luke Skywalker.

202
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,920
Did you hear a word I just said?

203
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,001
You think what?

204
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,808
I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword
and face down the whole First Order?

205
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,640
What did you think was going to happen here?

206
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,760
You think that I came

207
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,050
to the most unfindable place
in the galaxy for no reason at all?

208
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,965
Go away.

209
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,329
I'm not leaving without you!

210
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,407
Careful!

211
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,965
You're wasting your time.

212
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,483
Who are you?

213
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,447
I know this place.

214
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,845
Built a thousand generations ago

215
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,921
to keep these.

216
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,291
The original Jedi texts.

217
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,322
Just like me,
they're the last of the Jedi religion.

218
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,245
You've seen this place.

219
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,289
You've seen this island.

220
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,883
Only in dreams.

221
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,889
Who are you?

222
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,281
The Resistance sent me.

223
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,646
They sent you?

224
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,043
What's special about you?

225
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,848
- Where are you from?
- Nowhere.

226
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,806
- No one's from nowhere.
- Jakku.

227
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,765
All right, that is pretty much nowhere.

228
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,566
Why are you here, Rey, from nowhere?

229
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,767
The Resistance sent me.

230
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,040
We need your help.

231
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,201
The First Order's become unstoppable.

232
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,011
Why are you here?

233
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,002
Something inside me has always been there.

234
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,323
But now it's awake.

235
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,771
And I'm afraid.

236
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,041
I don't know what it is

237
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,563
or what to do with it.

238
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,131
And I need help.

239
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,002
You need a teacher.

240
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,241
I can't teach you.

241
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,087
Why not?

242
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,408
I've seen your daily routine.
You're not busy.

243
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,326
I will never train
another generation of Jedi.

244
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,967
I came to this island to die.

245
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,683
It's time for the Jedi to end.

246
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,726
Why?

247
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,400
Leia sent me here with hope.

248
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,405
If she was wrong, she deserves to know why.

249
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,766
We all do.

250
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,448
- You're demoted.
- What? Wait!

251
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,842
- We took down a dreadnought.
- At what cost?

252
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,730
You start an attack, you follow it through.

253
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,484
Poe, get your head out of your cockpit.

254
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,689
There are things that you cannot solve

255
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,764
by jumping in an X-wing
and blowing something up!

256
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,888
I need you to learn that.

257
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,769
There were heroes on that mission.

258
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,411
Dead heroes.

259
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,571
No leaders.

260
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,963
We're really nowhere.

261
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,963
How's Rey gonna find us now?

262
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,891
A cloaked binary beacon.

263
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,565
To light her way home.

264
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,128
All right, so until she gets back,
what's the plan?

265
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,089
We need to find a new base.

266
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,287
One with enough power

267
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,120
to get a distress signal
to our allies scattered in the Outer Rim.

268
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,804
Proximity alert!

269
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,081
They found us.

270
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,691
That's impossible.

271
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,043
That's Snoke's ship.

272
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,611
You gotta be kidding me.

273
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,440
- Can we jump to lightspeed?
- We have enough

274
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,851
fuel resources for just one jump.

275
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,206
Well, then, do it. We gotta get out of here.

276
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,691
Wait.

277
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,371
They've tracked us through lightspeed.

278
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,641
That's impossible.

279
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,161
Yes.

280
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,640
And they've done it.

281
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,760
So if we jump through lightspeed, they'll
just find us again and we'll be out of fuel.

282
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,841
They've got us.

283
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,764
Not yet, they don't.

284
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,200
Permission to jump in an X-wing
and blow something up?

285
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,691
Permission granted.

286
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,331
Admiral, swing us around!

287
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,608
Full astern. Rotate shields!

288
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,809
To your stations! Move, move, move!

289
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,681
Follow my lead.

290
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,126
<i>Green Squadron to launch position.</i>

291
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,408
<i>Clear all launch traffic.</i>

292
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,082
Don't wait for me! Jump in and fire her up!

293
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,205
<i>Technicians, lock down supplies
for launch conditions.</i>

294
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,883
Move! Move!

295
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,051
Poe, are you all right?

296
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,407
We need to get out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

297
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,971
We need to what?

298
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,485
Full engines ahead.

299
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,327
Get out of range of the Star Destroyers
and the fighters will fall back.

300
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,164
All craft, full engines!

301
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,368
Concentrate rear shields.

302
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,888
<i>Ren, the Resistance have pulled out of range.</i>

303
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,605
<i>We can't cover you at this distance.</i>

304
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,127
<i>Return to the fleet.</i>

305
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,361
What is the point of all this

306
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,922
if we can't blow up three tiny cruisers?

307
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,083
Well, they're faster and lighter, sir.

308
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,049
They can't lose us,
but they can keep at a range

309
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,407
where our cannons are ineffective
against their shields.

310
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,691
Well, keep up the barrage.

311
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,320
Let's at least remind them
that we're still here.

312
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,601
Very good, sir.

313
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,162
They won't last long burning fuel like this.

314
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,527
It's just a matter of time.

315
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,928
Move! Out of the way, everybody! Give room!

316
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,361
Life signs are weak, but she's fighting.

317
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,681
Artoo?

318
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,204
Artoo!

319
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,445
Yes.

320
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,960
Yeah, I know.

321
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,482
Hey, sacred island, watch the language.

322
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,000
Old friend.

323
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,688
I wish I could make you understand.

324
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,723
But I'm not coming back.

325
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,808
Nothing can make me change my mind.

326
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,606
<i>Years ago, you served my father
in the Clone Wars.</i>

327
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,531
<i>Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.</i>

328
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,880
<i>I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person...</i>

329
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,246
That was a cheap move.

330
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,051
<i>...but my ship has fallen under attack,</i>

331
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,680
<i>and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.</i>

332
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,768
<i>This is our most desperate hour.</i>

333
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,445
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

334
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,766
<i>You're my only hope.</i>

335
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,845
Tomorrow at dawn.

336
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,891
Three lessons.

337
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,646
I will teach you the ways of the Jedi

338
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,084
and why they need to end.

339
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,571
<i>General Organa,</i>

340
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,721
Leia,

341
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,565
is unconscious but recovering.

342
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,008
That's the only good news I have.

343
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,920
Admiral Ackbar,
all our leadership, they're gone.

344
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,003
Leia was the sole survivor on the bridge.

345
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,446
Oh, dear. Oh, dear!

346
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,730
If she were here, she'd say
save your sorrow for after the fight.

347
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,001
To that end,

348
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,806
the chain of command is clear
as to who should take her place.

349
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,570
Vice Admiral Holdo

350
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,764
of the cruiser <i>Ninka.</i>

351
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,285
Thank you, Commander.

352
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,806
Four hundred of us

353
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,485
on three ships.

354
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,606
We're the very last of the Resistance.

355
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,842
But we're not alone.

356
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,207
In every corner of the galaxy,

357
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,170
the downtrodden and oppressed
know our symbol,

358
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,204
and they put their hope in it.

359
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,560
We are the spark

360
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,201
that will light the fire that
will restore the Republic.

361
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,723
That spark, this Resistance, must survive.

362
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,882
That is our mission.

363
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,646
Now, to your stations.

364
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,447
And may the Force be with us.

365
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,286
That's Admiral Holdo?

366
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,320
Battle of Chyron Belt Admiral Holdo?

367
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,966
Not what I expected.

368
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,647
Vice Admiral? Commander Dameron.

369
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,645
With our current fuel consumption,
there's a very limited amount of time

370
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,530
that we can stay out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

371
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,047
Very kind of you to make me aware.

372
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,441
Let's get me those fuel projections.

373
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,365
And we need to shake 'em before we can
find a new base, so, what's our plan?

374
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,329
Our plan, captain?

375
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,884
Not commander, right?

376
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,202
Wasn't it Leia's last official act
to demote you

377
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,725
for your dreadnought plan

378
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,727
where we lost our entire bombing fleet?

379
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,480
"Captain." "Commander."

380
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,687
You can call me whatever you like.

381
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,690
I just wanna know what's going on.

382
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,521
Of course you do.

383
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,001
I understand.

384
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,524
I've dealt with plenty
of trigger-happy flyboys like you.

385
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,041
You're impulsive.

386
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,047
Dangerous.

387
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,004
And the last thing we need right now.

388
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,965
So stick to your post and follow my orders.

389
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,849
<i>Turbolink banks seven and eight
are offline due to maintenance.</i>

390
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,886
What are you doing here?

391
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,451
Hey. Hi.

392
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,446
Uh, I was... You know, I was just...

393
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,840
You're Finn!

394
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,006
The Finn!

395
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,244
- The Finn?
- Sorry.

396
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,170
I work behind pipes all day.

397
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,127
Doing talking with Resistance heroes
is not my forte.

398
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,486
Doing...

399
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,767
Doing talking.

400
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,451
I'm Rose.

401
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,920
Breathe.

402
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,128
- Okay.
- Yeah.

403
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,762
Look, I'm not a Resistance hero,
but it was nice talking to you, Rose.

404
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,764
May the Force be with you.

405
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,047
Wow. You, too.

406
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,444
Okay. But you are a hero.

407
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,090
You left the First Order,
what you did on the Starkiller Base...

408
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,731
When we heard about it, my sister Paige said,

409
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,450
"Rose, that's a real hero."

410
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,850
"Know right from wrong and don't run
away when it gets hard," she said.

411
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,281
You know...

412
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,120
Just this morning, I've had to stun

413
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,487
three people trying to
jump ship in this escape pod.

414
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,722
- What?
- They were running away.

415
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,241
That's disgraceful.

416
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,327
I know.

417
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,321
Anyway, uh...

418
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,164
Gotta get back to what I was doing, so...

419
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,651
What were you doing?

420
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,440
Uh, just...

421
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,363
- Doing some checks.
- Checking the escape pods.

422
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,887
- No, it's routine checks.
- By boarding one

423
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,051
with a packed bag.

424
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,761
Okay.

425
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,920
Listen, I'm...

426
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,643
I can't move. I can't move.

427
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,689
- I know.
- What happened?

428
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,649
I'm taking you to the brig
and turning you in for desertion.

429
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,961
I was not deserting.

430
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,362
- I told you that...
- My sister just died

431
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,124
protecting the fleet.

432
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,203
And you were running away.

433
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,367
I'm sorry.

434
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,082
But this fleet is doomed, and if my friend
comes back to it, she's doomed, too.

435
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,527
I've gotta get this...

436
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,889
I gotta get this beacon far away from here.

437
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,405
Then she'll find me and be safe.

438
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,129
You're a selfish traitor.

439
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,290
Look, we can't outrun the First Order fleet.

440
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,766
We can jump to lightspeed!

441
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,921
Well, they can track us through lightspeed.

442
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,560
They can track us through lightspeed?

443
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
Yeah.

444
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,800
They'd just show up thirty seconds later
and we'd have blown a ton of fuel,

445
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,008
which, by the way,
we're dangerously short on.

446
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,410
They can track us through lightspeed.

447
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,721
Yes. And they could...

448
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,241
I can't feel my teeth.

449
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,211
What did you shoot me with?

450
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,361
Active tracking.

451
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,567
What now?

452
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,281
Hyperspace tracking is new tech

453
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,966
but the principle must be
the same as any active tracker.

454
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,690
- They're only tracking us...
- Only tracking us...

455
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,166
...from the lead ship.

456
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,720
But we can't get to the tracker.

457
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,920
It's an A-class process,
they'll control it from the main bridge.

458
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,331
Well, I mean, yes,
but every A-class process...

459
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,881
...has a dedicated power breaker.

460
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,961
But... Wait, but who knows where
the breaker room is on a Star Destroyer?

461
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,129
I'm the guy that used to mop it.

462
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,163
If I can get us there,
I can shut their tracker down.

463
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,648
Just give it to me one more time, simpler.

464
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,122
So, the First Order's only tracking us
from one Destroyer, the lead one.

465
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,361
So we blow that one up?

466
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,726
I like where your head's at, but no.

467
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,610
They'd only start tracking us
from another Destroyer.

468
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,720
But if we can...

469
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,000
If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer
and disable the tracker

470
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,286
without them realizing, then we can...

471
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,522
They won't realize it's off
for one system cycle.

472
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,081
- About six minutes.
- Sneak on board.

473
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,925
Disable the tracker.

474
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,527
Our fleet escapes before they realize.

475
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,921
Hmm.

476
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,921
How'd you two meet?

477
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,881
Just luck.

478
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,721
Yeah?

479
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,240
Good luck?

480
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,841
Not sure yet.

481
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,685
Poe, we gotta do this.

482
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,047
It'll save the fleet and it'll save Rey.

483
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,371
If I must be the sole voice of reason,

484
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,523
Admiral Holdo will never agree to this plan.

485
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,326
Yeah, you're right, Threepio.

486
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,051
It's a "need-to-know" plan, and she doesn't.

487
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,850
- That wasn't exactly my...
- All right,

488
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,365
you guys shut down that tracker.

489
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,011
I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed.

490
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,161
The question is,

491
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,368
how do we sneak the two of you
onto Snoke's Destroyer?

492
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,561
We steal clearance codes.

493
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,643
No, they're bio-hexacrypt
and rescrambled every hour.

494
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,131
We can't get through their
security shields undetected.

495
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,040
Nobody can.

496
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,405
<i>Could I do it?</i>

497
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,802
<i>Of course I could do it. But I can't do it.</i>

498
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,840
<i>I'm a little tied down right now.</i>

499
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,200
Oh!

500
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,200
Maz? What is happening?

501
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,640
<i>Union dispute. You do not want
to hear about it</i>.

502
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,484
<i>But, lucky for you,</i>

503
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,400
<i>there's exactly one guy I trust
who can crack that kind of security!</i>

504
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,530
<i>He's a master codebreaker,</i>

505
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,720
<i>an ace pilot, a poet with a blaster.</i>

506
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,321
Oh, my.

507
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,762
It sounds like this codebreaker fellow
can do everything.

508
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,400
<i>Oh, yes, he can.</i>

509
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,771
<i>You'll find him with a red
plom bloom on his lapel</i>

510
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,526
<i>rolling at a high stakes table</i>

511
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,883
<i>in the casino on Canto Bight.</i>

512
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,044
Canto Bight? No, no. That's... Maz...

513
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,043
Is there any way that we can
take care of this ourselves?

514
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,885
<i>Sorry, kiddo. This is rarefied cracking.</i>

515
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,765
<i>You wanna get on that Destroyer,</i>

516
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,405
<i>I only know one option.</i>

517
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,446
<i>Find the Master Codebreaker.</i>

518
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,161
You'll bring Luke Skywalker to me.

519
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,647
You're not doing this.
The effort would kill you.

520
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,721
Can you see my surroundings?

521
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,405
You're gonna pay for what you did!

522
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,846
I can't see yours.

523
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,726
Just you.

524
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,371
So, no.

525
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,360
This is something else.

526
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,321
Luke.

527
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,444
What's that about?

528
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,441
I was cleaning my blaster. It went off.

529
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,640
Let's get started.

530
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,291
Who were those things?

531
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,411
Caretakers.

532
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,687
Island natives.

533
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,241
They've kept up the Jedi structures
since they were built.

534
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,530
I don't think they like me.

535
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,364
Can't imagine why.

536
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,321
Master Skywalker,
we need you to bring the Jedi back

537
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,290
because Kylo Ren is strong
with the dark side of the Force.

538
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,920
Without the Jedi, we won't
stand a chance against him.

539
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,401
What do you know about the Force?

540
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,765
It's a power that Jedi have
that lets them control people

541
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,920
and make things float.

542
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,001
Impressive.

543
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,128
Every word in that sentence was wrong.

544
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,883
Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed.

545
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,803
The Force is not a power you have.

546
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,281
It's not about lifting rocks.

547
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,483
It's the energy between all things,

548
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,722
a tension, a balance,

549
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,167
that binds the universe together.

550
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,321
Okay.

551
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,641
But what is it?

552
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,326
Close your eyes.

553
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,605
Breathe.

554
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,321
Now,

555
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,921
reach out.

556
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,727
I feel something.

557
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,840
- You feel it?
- Yes, I feel it.

558
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,921
- That's the Force.
- Really?

559
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,571
Wow, it must be really strong with you.

560
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,721
I've never felt any...

561
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,881
Ow!

562
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,960
You meant reach out like...

563
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,601
I'll try again.

564
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,121
Breathe.

565
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,249
Just breathe.

566
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,642
Reach out with your feelings.

567
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,206
What do you see?

568
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,281
The island.

569
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,247
<i>Life.</i>

570
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,931
<i>Death and decay,</i>

571
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,925
<i>that feeds new life.</i>

572
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,647
<i>Warmth.</i>

573
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,761
Cold.

574
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,451
<i>Peace.</i>

575
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,326
<i>Violence.</i>

576
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,851
And between it all?

577
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,641
Balance.

578
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,640
An energy.

579
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,285
A Force.

580
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,524
And inside you?

581
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,284
Inside me

582
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,522
that same Force.

583
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,810
And this is the lesson.

584
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,089
That Force does not belong to the Jedi.

585
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,125
To say that if the Jedi die,
the light dies, is vanity.

586
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,448
Can you feel that?

587
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,850
There's something else

588
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,325
beneath the island.

589
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,241
<i>A place.</i>

590
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,761
A dark place.

591
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,007
Balance.

592
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,603
Powerful light, powerful darkness.

593
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,087
It's cold.

594
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,921
It's calling me.

595
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,287
Resist it, Rey.

596
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,606
Rey?

597
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,201
Rey!

598
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,849
You went straight to the dark.

599
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,770
That place was trying to show me something.

600
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,763
It offered something you needed.

601
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,681
And you didn't even try to stop yourself.

602
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,444
But I didn't see you.

603
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,084
Nothing from you.

604
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,841
You've closed yourself off from the Force.

605
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,765
Of course you have.

606
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,203
I've seen this raw strength only once before,

607
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,484
in Ben Solo.

608
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,370
It didn't scare me enough then.

609
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,085
It does now.

610
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,481
What was that?

611
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,846
Nothing, admiral.

612
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,405
Passing debris.

613
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,563
The fleet's only got 18 hours of fuel left.

614
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,291
We gotta hurry.

615
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,560
Still can't reach the Resistance?

616
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,324
Keep at it.

617
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,170
If you get through, check their status.

618
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,640
And ask about Finn.

619
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,808
Why is the Force connecting us?

620
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,161
You and I.

621
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,731
Murderous snake.

622
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,529
You're too late. You lost. I found Skywalker.

623
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,006
Did he tell you what happened?

624
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,562
The night I destroyed his temple,
did he tell you why?

625
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,326
I know everything I need to know about you.

626
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,005
You do?

627
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,483
Ah, you do.

628
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,683
You have that look in your eyes.

629
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,649
From the forest.

630
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,560
When you called me a monster.

631
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,848
You are a monster.

632
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,445
Yes, I am.

633
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,761
Okay.

634
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,202
We get in, we find this codebreaker,
we get out.

635
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,567
You know this town? Canto Bight?

636
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,926
From stories.

637
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,528
It's a terrible place filled with
the worst people in the galaxy.

638
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,641
Great.

639
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,530
I told those two, I said,

640
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,365
"This is a public beach.
You can't park that shuttle here."

641
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,126
But they just lit off toward the casino.

642
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,685
Place your bets. Place your bets.

643
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,644
All bets on the table right now, right now!

644
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,807
Place your bets here.

645
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,569
Aw, yes! This place is great!

646
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,531
Okay.

647
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,401
Maz said this Master Codebreaker
would have a red plom bloom on his lapel.

648
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,324
Let's find him and get out of here.

649
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,520
Well played. The house wins.

650
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,800
Where are your manners, more like?

651
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,961
Come on!

652
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,720
We've covered this whole casino.

653
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,800
Zero red plom blooms.

654
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,120
Where is this guy?

655
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,964
Were those what I think they were?

656
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,163
- What are those things?
- Fathiers.

657
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,605
I've never seen a real one.

658
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,931
Look, this whole place is beautiful.
I mean, come on.

659
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,330
Why do you hate it so much?

660
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,566
Look closer.

661
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,605
My sister and I grew up
in a poor mining system.

662
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,528
The First Order stripped
our ore to finance their military

663
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,048
then shelled us to test their weapons.

664
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,162
They took everything we had.

665
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,051
And who do you think these people are?

666
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,968
There's only one business in the galaxy
that'll get you this rich.

667
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,767
War.

668
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,607
Selling weapons to the First Order.

669
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:55,367
I wish I could put my fist through this
whole lousy, beautiful town.

670
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,847
Red plom bloom!

671
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,127
Red plom bloom!

672
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,481
The Master Codebreaker!

673
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,400
Yep, those are the shuttle parkers.

674
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,601
All right.

675
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,169
You two are under arrest
for parking violation 27B/6.

676
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,320
You have the right to remain...

677
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,520
- What was that?
- No, no, no. Not now, Lovey.

678
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,647
I'm on a roll.

679
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,045
Lesson two.

680
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,404
Now that they're extinct,
the Jedi are romanticized, deified.

681
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,645
But if you strip away the myth
and look at their deeds,

682
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,168
the legacy of the Jedi is failure.

683
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,641
Hypocrisy, hubris.

684
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,761
That's not true.

685
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,486
At the height of their powers,
they allowed Darth Sidious to rise

686
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,529
create the Empire, and wipe them out.

687
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,843
It was a Jedi Master who was responsible

688
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,129
for the training and creation of Darth Vader.

689
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,805
And a Jedi who saved him.

690
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,050
Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy.

691
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,407
But you saw there was conflict inside him.

692
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,206
You believed that he wasn't gone.
That he could be turned.

693
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,244
And I became a legend.

694
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,762
For many years, there was balance

695
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,331
and then I saw

696
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,601
Ben.

697
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,727
My nephew with that mighty Skywalker blood.

698
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,245
And in my hubris,

699
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,563
I thought I could train him,
I could pass on my strengths.

700
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,082
Han was Han about it, but...

701
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,165
Leia

702
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,967
trusted me with her son.

703
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,761
I took him,

704
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,564
and a dozen students,

705
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,125
and began a training temple.

706
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,283
By the time I realized

707
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,609
I was no match for
the darkness rising in him,

708
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,770
it was too late.

709
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,445
What happened?

710
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,371
<i>I went to confront him.</i>

711
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,324
<i>And he turned on me.</i>

712
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,211
Ben, no!

713
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,448
<i>He must have thought I was dead.</i>

714
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,360
<i>When I came to,</i>

715
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,124
<i>the temple was burning.</i>

716
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,245
<i>He had vanished
with a handful of my students.</i>

717
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,527
<i>And slaughtered the rest.</i>

718
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,963
<i>Leia blamed Snoke,</i>

719
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,880
<i>but it was me.</i>

720
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,011
<i>I failed.</i>

721
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:25,569
Because I was Luke Skywalker.

722
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,403
Jedi Master.

723
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,404
A legend.

724
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,887
The galaxy may need a legend.

725
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,770
I need someone to show me
my place in all this.

726
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,330
And you didn't fail Kylo.

727
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,170
Kylo failed you.

728
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,564
I won't.

729
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,085
The main cruiser's
still keeping beyond range.

730
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,403
But their medical frigate is out of fuel

731
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,284
and its shields are down.

732
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,329
The beginning of their end.

733
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,564
Destroy it.

734
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,922
The last of our crew has been evacuated
and heading your way.

735
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,610
It's been an honor, admiral.

736
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,649
<i>Godspeed, Rebels!</i>

737
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,047
Admiral,

738
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,728
fuel reserves at six hours.

739
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,568
Maintain our current course.

740
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,084
Steady on.

741
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,161
Finn,

742
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,448
Rose, where are you guys?

743
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,961
Deal me in.

744
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,080
Thanks.

745
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,249
Finn, the fleet is running on fumes.

746
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,880
Without a codebreaker
to break us onto Snoke's Star Destroyer...

747
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,684
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

748
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,846
Unless you got a thief in your pocket,
our plan is shot.

749
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,251
Um, I can do it.

750
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,401
What?

751
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,207
What?

752
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,161
What?

753
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,924
S-S-Sorry, I just

754
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,360
couldn't help but overhear all the stuff

755
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,410
that you were saying really loudly

756
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,445
while I was trying to sleep.

757
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,051
Codebreaker?

758
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,445
Thief?

759
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,606
I can do it.

760
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,525
We're not talking about
picking pockets, okay?

761
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,483
Yeah.

762
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,408
D-D-Don't let the wrapper fool you, friend.

763
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,647
Me and the First Order codeage go way back.

764
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,607
And,

765
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,209
if the price is right,

766
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:30,367
I could break you into
old man S-S-Snoke's boudoir.

767
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,049
- No.
- We're... We got it covered.

768
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,966
Ha-tuk-ga.

769
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,204
- Did he just...
- Yeah.

770
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,410
We gotta get out of here! This way!

771
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,640
Why you little...

772
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,560
D-D-Did you do this?

773
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,727
Hey, hands up!

774
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,122
- Hands up!
- Yeah, man.

775
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,844
What's your story, roundie?

776
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,640
They went this way!

777
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,403
- Lock down all the exits.
- Wait.

778
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,564
That smelled great.

779
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,563
Those cops will be here any minute. What now?

780
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,930
Whoa! Ooh!

781
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,610
No, wait. Please, don't!

782
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,240
We're with the Resistance.

783
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,208
Roger that. Checking the stables now.

784
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,120
This way.

785
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,200
They must have come through here.

786
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,361
Hyah!

787
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,243
Go, go, go! Whoo!

788
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,680
Stop enjoying this! Stop enjoying this!

789
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,567
<i>We've got them. They're not going anywhere.</i>

790
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:26,681
Ahhh!

791
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,761
Huh?

792
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,444
Move, move, move! Get out of the way!

793
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,522
Our ship's on the beach straight ahead!

794
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,521
We need cover!

795
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,686
Too much cover!

796
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,327
There it is!

797
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,843
- No!
- Come on!

798
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,889
<i>Let the herd go. Stick with the perps.</i>

799
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,687
<i>Where'd they go?</i>

800
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,001
I think we lost him!

801
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,810
Now we get down to the beach
and circle back around...

802
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,001
Cliff!

803
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,200
We're trapped.

804
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,366
It was worth it, though.

805
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,286
To tear up that town,

806
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,880
make 'em hurt.

807
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,481
Go.

808
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,760
Now it's worth it.

809
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,041
<i>There they are.</i>

810
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,200
BB-8! Wait, are you flying that thing?

811
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,246
Ah.

812
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,924
N-N-Need a lift?

813
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,801
Luke.

814
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,281
Leia.

815
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,009
I'd rather not do this now.

816
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,045
Yeah, me, too.

817
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,004
Why did you hate your father?

818
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,925
Do you have something,
a cowl or something you could put on?

819
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,007
Why did you hate your father?
Give me an honest answer.

820
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,126
You had a father who loved you,
he gave a damn about you.

821
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,368
- I didn't hate him.
- Then why?

822
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,761
Why what?

823
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,725
Why what? Say it.

824
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,371
Why did you...

825
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,128
Why did you kill him?

826
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,766
I don't understand.

827
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,921
No?

828
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,684
Your parents threw you away like garbage.

829
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,962
- They didn't!
- They did.

830
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,929
But you can't stop needing them.

831
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,320
It's your greatest weakness.

832
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,241
Looking for them everywhere,

833
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,606
in Han Solo,

834
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,889
now in Skywalker.

835
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,089
Did he tell you what happened that night?

836
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,441
Yes.

837
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,601
No.

838
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,010
<i>He had sensed my power,</i>

839
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,050
<i>as he senses yours.</i>

840
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,004
<i>And he feared it.</i>

841
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,126
Liar.

842
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,925
Let the past die.

843
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,841
Kill it if you have to.

844
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,131
That's the only way to become
what you were meant to be.

845
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,243
No! No!

846
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,131
<i>Rey?</i>

847
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,885
<i>I should have felt trapped or panicked.</i>

848
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,531
<i>But I didn't.</i>

849
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:14,920
<i>This didn't go on forever,</i>

850
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,162
<i>I knew it was leading somewhere.</i>

851
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,400
<i>And that, at the end,
it would show me what I came to see.</i>

852
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,971
<i>Rey.</i>

853
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,687
Let me see them.

854
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,163
My parents,

855
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,402
please.

856
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,602
I thought I'd find answers here.

857
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,565
I was wrong.

858
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,884
I'd never felt so alone.

859
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,811
You're not alone.

860
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,251
Neither are you.

861
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,611
Rey?

862
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,084
It isn't too late.

863
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,847
Stop!

864
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,124
Is it true? Did you try to murder him?

865
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,726
Leave this island now!

866
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,086
Stop.

867
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,361
Stop!

868
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,001
Did you do it?

869
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,203
Did you create Kylo Ren?

870
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,450
Tell me the truth.

871
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,648
I saw darkness.

872
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,363
<i>I'd sensed it building in him.</i>

873
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,171
<i>I'd seen it in moments during his training.</i>

874
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,523
<i>But then I looked inside,</i>

875
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,725
<i>and it was beyond what I ever imagined.</i>

876
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,122
<i>Snoke had already turned his heart.</i>

877
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,560
<i>He would bring destruction,
and pain, and death,</i>

878
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,680
<i>and the end of everything I love
because of what he will become.</i>

879
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,640
<i>And for the briefest moment of pure instinct,</i>

880
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:22,007
<i>I thought I could stop it.</i>

881
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,560
<i>It passed like a fleeting shadow.</i>

882
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,329
<i>And I was left with shame,</i>

883
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,608
<i>and with consequence.</i>

884
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,249
<i>And the last thing I saw</i>

885
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,680
<i>were the eyes of a frightened boy</i>

886
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,240
<i>whose master had failed him.</i>

887
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:42,921
Ben, no!

888
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,960
You failed him by thinking
his choice was made.

889
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,041
It wasn't.

890
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,289
There's still conflict in him.

891
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,091
If he were turned from the dark side,
that could shift the tide.

892
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,004
This could be how we win.

893
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:03,164
This is not going to go the way you think.

894
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,920
It is.

895
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,885
Just now when we touched hands,

896
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,326
I saw his future.

897
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,970
As solid as I'm seeing you.

898
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:15,967
If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.

899
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,287
Rey,

900
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,842
don't do this.

901
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,324
Then he's our last hope.

902
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,845
Master Yoda.

903
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,126
Young Skywalker.

904
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,845
I'm ending all of this.

905
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,640
The tree, the text, the Jedi.

906
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,006
I'm gonna burn it down.

907
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,001
Hmm.

908
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,840
Ah, Skywalker.

909
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:10,967
Missed you, have I.

910
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,810
So it is time

911
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,169
for the Jedi Order to end.

912
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,562
Time it is.

913
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,651
Hmm.

914
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:41,880
For you to look past
a pile of old books, hmm?

915
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,724
The sacred Jedi texts.

916
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,042
Oh. Read them, have you?

917
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,205
- Well, I...
- Page-turners

918
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,640
they were not.

919
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,169
Yes, yes, yes.

920
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,691
Wisdom they held,

921
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,322
but that library contained
nothing that the girl Rey

922
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,403
does not already possess.

923
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,244
Skywalker,

924
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,083
still looking to the horizon.

925
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,720
Never here, now, hmm?

926
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,491
The need in front of your nose.

927
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,281
Hmm?

928
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,810
I was weak.

929
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,041
Unwise.

930
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,771
Lost Ben Solo, you did.

931
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,926
Lose Rey, we must not.

932
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,170
I can't be what she needs me to be.

933
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,007
Heeded my words not, did you?

934
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,966
Pass on what you have learned.

935
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,248
Strength, mastery.

936
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,804
But weakness,

937
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,361
folly, failure also.

938
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:45,649
Yes, failure most of all.

939
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,770
The greatest teacher, failure is.

940
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,081
Luke,

941
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:05,082
we are what they grow beyond.

942
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:10,050
That is the true burden of all masters.

943
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,248
Four parsecs to go. This thing really cooks.

944
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,084
I just hope we're in time.

945
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,651
You can actually do this, right?

946
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,203
Yeah, about that...

947
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,408
Guys, I can do it.

948
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,051
But there exists a pre-"do it"
conversation about price.

949
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,167
Once we're done, the Resistance
will give you whatever you want.

950
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,087
What you got deposit-wise?

951
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,167
Are you kidding me? Look at us.

952
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,004
Is that Haysian smelt?

953
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:56,971
That's something.

954
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,327
No, we gave you our word.
You're gonna get paid.

955
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,646
That should be enough.

956
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,086
Guys, I wanna keep helping.

957
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,682
But no something, n-n-no doing.

958
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,843
Okay, listen here, you've got...

959
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,050
Do it.

960
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,889
Now I can help.

961
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,441
Give it back.

962
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:21,920
What?

963
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,082
Give it back!

964
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,129
You have no idea how much
that medallion means to her.

965
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,729
What are you... Why are you
ransacking your own ship?

966
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,240
It's not your ship.

967
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,087
He says I stole it.

968
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,440
- Yeah, I got that.
- We stole it.

969
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,602
At least you're stealing from the bad guys

970
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:44,241
and helping the good.

971
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,368
Good guys, bad guys,

972
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,568
made-up words.

973
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,841
Let's see who formerly owned
this gorgeous hunk-uh.

974
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,167
Ah, this guy was an arms dealer.

975
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,169
Made his bank selling weapons
to the bad guys.

976
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:04,881
Oh...

977
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,971
And the good.

978
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:12,324
Finn, let me learn you something big.

979
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,848
It's all a machine, partner.

980
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,365
Live free, don't join.

981
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,801
That was the last of their support ships.

982
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,047
It's just their main cruiser now.

983
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,091
And their fuel reserve?

984
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,970
By our calculation,

985
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:41,611
critical.

986
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:46,840
She in there?

987
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:47,921
The admiral's banned you from the bridge.

988
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,485
- Let's not have a scene.
- No, let's.

989
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,483
- Holdo?
- You're not allowed in here.

990
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,000
- Flyboy.
- Cut it, lady.

991
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,800
We had a fleet, now we're down to one ship,

992
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,610
and you've told us nothing!

993
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,323
Tell us that we have a plan!

994
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:02,481
That there's hope!

995
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,051
When I served under Leia,

996
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,680
she would say, hope is like the sun.

997
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,366
If you only believe in it
when you can see it...

998
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,762
You'll never make it through the night.

999
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,531
Yes.

1000
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,648
Are you fueling up the transports?

1001
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,446
You are.

1002
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,400
All of them?

1003
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:36,286
We're abandoning ship? Is that...

1004
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,569
That's what you got?
That's what you brought us to?

1005
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,281
Coward!

1006
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:44,050
Those transport ships
are unarmed, unshielded.

1007
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,487
We abandon this cruiser, we're done.

1008
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,371
We don't stand a chance.
No, you are not just a coward,

1009
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,045
you are a traitor.

1010
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,002
Get this man off my bridge.

1011
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,120
<i>Finn, Holdo's loading
the crew in the shuttle.</i>

1012
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,009
<i>She's going to abandon ship. Where are you?</i>

1013
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,890
Poe, we're on our way back to the fleet.

1014
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,201
We're so close.

1015
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,407
Did you find the Master Codebreaker?

1016
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,688
Well, we found a codebreaker.

1017
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,200
<i>We can shut the tracker down.</i>

1018
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,283
<i>Just buy us a little more time.</i>

1019
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,010
All right. Hurry.

1020
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,964
As soon as I launch,
you jump back out of range.

1021
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,880
Stay there until you get my signal
for where to rendezvous.

1022
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,480
If you see Finn before I do,

1023
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,560
tell him...

1024
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,520
Yeah, perfect. Tell him that.

1025
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,841
Cloaking our approach.
We should be off their scopes.

1026
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:49,961
Then we slice a slit in their shield.

1027
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,770
Blip bloppity bloop,

1028
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,768
and slip right through.

1029
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,329
So a stormtrooper
and a who now are doing what?

1030
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,641
They are trying to save us.

1031
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,404
This is our best chance for escape.

1032
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,523
You have to give Finn and Rose
all the time that you can.

1033
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,047
You have bet the survival of the Resistance

1034
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,965
on bad odds and put us all at risk.

1035
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,281
There's no time now.

1036
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,480
We have to get clear of the cruiser.
Load the transports.

1037
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,560
Right away, admiral.

1038
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,760
Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that.

1039
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,800
Vice Admiral Holdo,

1040
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,689
I am relieving you of your command

1041
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:40,128
for the survival of this ship,
its crew, and the Resistance.

1042
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,242
I hope you understand what you're doing.

1043
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:44,761
Yeah.

1044
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,127
I'm going to the bridge.

1045
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,283
If they move, stun them.

1046
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:11,645
- ...at least three cycles so far.
- Yes, sir. We are working on it.

1047
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,763
I will do my best, sir.

1048
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,166
Almost there.

1049
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,084
You don't have to do this.

1050
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,244
I feel the conflict in you.

1051
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,130
It's tearing you apart.

1052
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,527
Ben, when we touched hands,

1053
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,205
I saw your future.

1054
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,801
Just the shape of it, but solid and clear.

1055
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,602
You will not bow before Snoke.

1056
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,210
You'll turn.

1057
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,090
I'll help you.

1058
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,165
I saw it.

1059
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,970
I saw something, too.

1060
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,401
Because of what I saw,

1061
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,006
I know when the moment comes,
you'll be the one to turn.

1062
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,529
You'll stand with me.

1063
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,201
Rey,

1064
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,721
I saw who your parents are.

1065
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,924
Well done, my good and faithful apprentice.

1066
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:46,290
My faith in you is restored.

1067
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,642
Young Rey.

1068
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,330
Welcome.

1069
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:59,966
So this is it.

1070
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:02,009
The tracker's right behind this door.

1071
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,328
Haysian smelt.

1072
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,171
Best conductor.

1073
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,285
And you're welcome.

1074
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,124
Good time to figure out
how we get back to the fleet?

1075
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,960
I know where the nearest escape pods are.

1076
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,040
Course you do.

1077
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,920
<i>BB-8, tell me something good.</i>

1078
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,006
Poe, we're almost there.

1079
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,400
<i>Have the cruiser prepped for lightspeed.</i>

1080
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,762
Yeah, I'm on it, pal. You just hurry.

1081
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,883
Clear the bridge, escort the
officers down to the hangar.

1082
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,529
Commander... Captain Dameron,
Admiral Holdo was looking for you.

1083
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:53,841
Yeah, we spoke.

1084
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,522
Sir, I am almost afraid to ask.

1085
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,523
Good instinct, Threepio. Go with that.

1086
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,281
Seal that door!

1087
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,120
We're running out of time.

1088
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,440
Come on, how's it going?

1089
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,170
Almost there.

1090
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,043
Threepio, where do you think you're going?

1091
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,203
It would be quite against my programming

1092
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,090
- to be party to a mutiny.
- Hey!

1093
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,083
It is not correct protocol.

1094
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,360
Oh! Neither is this!

1095
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,408
Finn? We're ready to make the jump!

1096
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,840
Now or never.

1097
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:40,811
Now.

1098
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:48,841
You're up.

1099
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,840
- <i>You there, hands up!</i>
- <i>Watch 'em, watch 'em.</i>

1100
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,960
- <i>Drop your weapons, now!</i>
- <i>Hands up, Rebel scum.</i>

1101
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,724
<i>Get down! I said, down!</i>

1102
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,289
<i>FN-2187.</i>

1103
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:28,527
<i>So good to have you back.</i>

1104
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,487
They didn't make it.

1105
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,527
Leia.

1106
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,365
<i>Please board the transports</i>

1107
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,767
<i>according to your evacuation designation.</i>

1108
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:01,920
<i>All transports must be cleared...</i>

1109
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,161
Okay, help me push him up, guys.

1110
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,051
That one's a troublemaker.

1111
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,920
I like him.

1112
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,687
Me, too.

1113
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,403
Now, time to board your transport.

1114
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,210
For the transports to escape,

1115
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:18,170
someone needs to stay behind
and pilot the cruiser.

1116
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,330
Too many losses.

1117
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,128
I can't take any more.

1118
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,766
Sure you can.

1119
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,208
You taught me how.

1120
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:36,920
May the Force be...

1121
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,690
You go on. I've said it enough.

1122
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,922
May the Force be with you always.

1123
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,920
<i>Cloaking device activated.</i>

1124
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,843
<i>We should be off their scopes.</i>

1125
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,401
Let's hope this works.

1126
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,327
Come closer, child.

1127
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,646
So much strength.

1128
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,083
Darkness rises,

1129
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:30,001
and light to meet it.

1130
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:34,845
I warned my young apprentice
that as he grew stronger,

1131
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,731
his equal in the light would rise.

1132
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,400
Skywalker...

1133
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:43,323
I assumed.

1134
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,401
Wrongly.

1135
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:50,449
Closer, I said.

1136
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,004
You underestimate Skywalker,

1137
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:00,847
and Ben Solo,

1138
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,806
and me.

1139
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,323
It will be your downfall.

1140
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,601
Oh...

1141
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,883
Have you seen something?

1142
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:12,290
A weakness in my apprentice.

1143
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,443
Is that why you came?

1144
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,884
Young fool.

1145
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:22,767
It was I who bridged your minds.

1146
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:26,568
I stoked Ren's conflicted soul.

1147
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:29,849
I knew he was not strong enough
to hide it from you.

1148
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,245
And you were not wise enough
to resist the bait.

1149
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,131
And now,

1150
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:45,520
you will give me Skywalker.

1151
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,166
Then I will kill you

1152
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,045
with the cruelest stroke.

1153
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:53,881
No.

1154
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:55,760
Yes.

1155
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,485
Give me

1156
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,530
everything.

1157
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:07,764
No! No!

1158
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:09,287
No!

1159
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,010
No. No.

1160
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,366
No, no, no!

1161
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:25,361
Poe.

1162
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,081
What is that?

1163
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:34,049
The mineral planet, Crait.

1164
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,567
An uncharted hideout from
the days of the Rebellion.

1165
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:38,969
- That's a Rebel base?
- Abandoned,

1166
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,600
but heavily armored with enough power

1167
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:44,241
to get a distress signal to our allies
scattered in the Outer Rim.

1168
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,521
Holdo knew the First Order
was tracking our big ship.

1169
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:50,525
They're not monitoring for little transports.

1170
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:53,247
So we could slip down
to the surface unnoticed

1171
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:56,688
and hide till the First Order passes.

1172
01:39:58,840 --> 01:39:59,921
That could work.

1173
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,528
She was more interested

1174
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:06,007
in protecting the light than she was

1175
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,040
seeming like a hero.

1176
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,286
Godspeed,

1177
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,005
Rebels.

1178
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,085
Well done, Phasma.

1179
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,965
<i>Your ship and payment, as we agreed.</i>

1180
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,444
You lying snake.

1181
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,567
We got caught,

1182
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,322
I cut a d-d-deal.

1183
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:22,171
Wait, cut a deal with what?

1184
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:23,924
Sir, we checked on the
information from the thief.

1185
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:26,886
We ran a decloaking scan, and sure enough,

1186
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,361
30 Resistance transports
have just launched from the cruiser.

1187
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,722
He told us the truth.

1188
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,204
Will wonders never cease?

1189
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,401
No.

1190
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,841
Our weapons are ready?

1191
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,365
Ready and aimed, sir.

1192
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,850
Fire at will.

1193
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,085
Wait. No, no. No, you can't!

1194
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,005
No!

1195
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:01,764
<i>Admiral, we're taking fire!</i>

1196
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,365
<i>- Do we turn around?</i>
- No, you're too far out.

1197
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,170
Full speed to planetfall.

1198
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,321
Full speed!

1199
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:14,160
Well, well,

1200
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:18,006
I did not expect Skywalker to be so wise.

1201
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:21,171
We will give him and the Jedi Order

1202
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,727
the death he desires.

1203
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,600
After the Rebels are gone,

1204
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,251
we will go to his planet

1205
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:31,246
and obliterate the entire island.

1206
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:39,451
Such spunk.

1207
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,247
Look here now.

1208
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:53,720
The entire Resistance on those transports...

1209
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:58,081
Soon they will all be gone.

1210
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,569
For you, all is lost.

1211
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:09,605
Ooh. And still that fiery spit of hope.

1212
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:14,403
You have the spirit of a true Jedi!

1213
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,211
And because of that,

1214
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:26,731
you must die.

1215
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,682
My worthy apprentice,

1216
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,606
son of darkness, heir apparent to Lord Vader.

1217
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:39,208
Where there was conflict,
I now sense resolve.

1218
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,085
Where there was weakness, strength.

1219
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,484
Complete your training,

1220
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:49,203
and fulfill your destiny.

1221
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:00,124
I know what I have to do.

1222
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,280
Ben.

1223
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:07,167
You think you can turn him?

1224
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,529
Pathetic child.

1225
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:13,481
I cannot be betrayed,

1226
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:15,728
I cannot be beaten.

1227
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:18,247
I see his mind,

1228
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,480
I see his every intent.

1229
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,561
Yes.

1230
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:29,769
I see him turning
the lightsaber to strike true.

1231
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:31,401
And now,

1232
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,089
foolish child,

1233
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,208
he ignites it,

1234
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:40,401
and kills his true enemy!

1235
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,250
Come on, give it full thrusters. Full speed!

1236
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,811
I am, sir.

1237
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:29,005
You murdering bastard!

1238
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:31,802
T-T-Take it easy, Big F.

1239
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:35,085
They blow you up today,
you blow them up tomorrow.

1240
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:37,450
It's just business.

1241
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,206
You're wrong.

1242
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,927
Maybe.

1243
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,401
Ben!

1244
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:43,841
The fleet.

1245
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,001
Order them to stop firing.

1246
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,969
There's still time to save the fleet.

1247
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:56,761
Ben?

1248
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,928
It's time to let old things die.

1249
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:04,766
Snoke,

1250
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,206
Skywalker.

1251
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:09,605
The Sith,

1252
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,123
the Jedi, the Rebels...

1253
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:13,645
Let it all die.

1254
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:15,327
Rey.

1255
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:18,851
I want you to join me.

1256
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:23,371
We can rule together
and bring a new order to the galaxy.

1257
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:24,931
Don't do this, Ben.

1258
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,161
Please don't go this way.

1259
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:30,802
No, no. You're still holding on! Let go!

1260
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:34,247
Do you wanna know the truth
about your parents?

1261
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:36,651
Or have you always known?

1262
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:40,810
And you've just hidden it away.

1263
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,365
You know the truth.

1264
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,645
Say it.

1265
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,000
Say it.

1266
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,525
They were nobody.

1267
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:56,330
They were filthy junk traders

1268
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,403
who sold you off for drinking money.

1269
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:03,569
They're dead in a paupers'
grave in the Jakku desert.

1270
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,288
You have no place in this story.

1271
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:08,443
You come from nothing. You're nothing.

1272
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:14,046
But not to me.

1273
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:19,121
Join me.

1274
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:33,647
Please.

1275
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,041
Sir,

1276
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:08,405
the Resistance cruiser's
preparing to jump to lightspeed.

1277
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:10,281
It's empty.

1278
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,249
They're just trying
to pull our attention away.

1279
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:13,881
Pathetic.

1280
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,242
Keep your fire on the transports.

1281
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,811
<i>Execution by blaster is too good for them.</i>

1282
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,008
<i>Let's make this hurt.</i>

1283
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,721
Finn.

1284
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:01,964
<i>On my command.</i>

1285
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,046
She's running away.

1286
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:11,321
No, she isn't.

1287
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:28,210
- No!
- Fire on that cruiser!

1288
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:43,041
<i>Execute.</i>

1289
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,241
Finn!

1290
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:31,290
There's a shuttle back that way! We gotta go!

1291
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:48,125
<i>Traitor!</i>

1292
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:50,801
<i>What?</i>

1293
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:15,121
Finn!

1294
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,284
<i>You are a bug in the system.</i>

1295
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:37,846
Let's go, chrome dome.

1296
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,647
Come on!

1297
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:57,321
No!

1298
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,281
Hey.

1299
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:22,891
<i>You were always scum.</i>

1300
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:25,965
Rebel scum.

1301
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:41,682
Hey! Need a lift?

1302
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:21,568
What happened?

1303
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:23,844
The girl murdered Snoke.

1304
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:29,645
What happened?

1305
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:32,371
She took Snoke's escape craft.

1306
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:34,171
We know where she's going.

1307
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:36,890
Get all our forces down
to that Resistance base.

1308
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,805
Let's finish this.

1309
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:40,761
Finish this?

1310
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:43,442
Who do you think you're talking to?

1311
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:46,406
You presume to command my army?

1312
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:50,528
Our Supreme Leader is dead! We have no ruler!

1313
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:58,362
The Supreme Leader is dead.

1314
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:03,449
Long live the Supreme Leader.

1315
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,442
They're coming, shut the door.

1316
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:32,884
Incoming!

1317
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,369
Go! Go! Move!

1318
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:41,288
Get that shield door down!

1319
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:58,440
No! Wait, don't shoot! It's us!

1320
01:56:58,520 --> 01:56:59,567
No! Don't shoot!

1321
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:00,721
Hold your fire!

1322
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,928
- Don't shoot!
- Hold your fire!

1323
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:06,720
- Finn?
- Finn!

1324
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:08,930
Rose! You're not dead!

1325
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:10,320
Where's my droid?

1326
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:12,647
Buddy!

1327
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,326
I'm so glad to see you!

1328
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,882
Wait, what? Wait, wait, wait, slow down.

1329
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:20,326
Is this all that's left?

1330
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:32,887
All right, shields are up
so they can't hit us from orbit.

1331
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:34,440
Use whatever power we've got left

1332
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:36,648
to broadcast a distress signal
to the Outer Rim.

1333
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,484
Use my personal code.

1334
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:41,805
If there are any allies to the Resistance,

1335
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:43,487
it's now or never.

1336
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:46,123
Rose, what do you got?

1337
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:50,207
Rotting munitions, rusted artillery,
some half-gutted skim speeders.

1338
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:53,805
Well, let's just pray that big-ass door

1339
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:56,200
holds long enough for us to get help.

1340
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,289
A battering ram cannon.

1341
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:10,090
A what now?

1342
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:11,931
Miniaturized Death Star tech.

1343
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:13,844
It'll crack that door open like an egg.

1344
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:16,330
There has to be a back way
out of here, right?

1345
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:19,369
BB-8, what do you got?

1346
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:23,369
BB-8 has analyzed the mine's schematics.

1347
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:26,640
This is the only way in or out.

1348
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,001
Come on.

1349
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,240
We have allies.

1350
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:39,323
People believe in Leia.

1351
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,570
They'll get our message, they'll come.

1352
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:44,362
But we have to buy time.

1353
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:48,005
We gotta take out that cannon.

1354
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:53,280
On me! On me!

1355
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:55,481
Move! Move!

1356
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:57,165
Go back! Gather your weapons!

1357
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:58,765
Get over here!

1358
01:58:58,920 --> 01:58:59,921
Hold your fire!

1359
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:18,201
Salt.

1360
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:19,646
Ground forces, incoming.

1361
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:21,484
<i>Copy that. On our way.</i>

1362
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,041
Engage your mono-ski.

1363
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:41,770
<i>The green toggle.</i>

1364
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:52,961
All right, listen up.

1365
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:56,289
I don't like these rust buckets
and I don't like our odds, but...

1366
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,091
What the hell?

1367
01:59:58,240 --> 01:59:59,526
Just keep it tight

1368
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:02,650
and don't get drawn in too close
till they roll that cannon out front.

1369
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,762
All right, ground forces, lay down some fire!

1370
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,689
Thirteen incoming light craft.

1371
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:41,763
Shall we hold until we clear them?

1372
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:44,850
No. The Resistance is in that mine.

1373
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,521
Push through.

1374
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:52,885
Fighters, break off!

1375
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:05,850
Come on! We gotta hold them
till they pull up that cannon!

1376
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:23,328
<i>Rose, you got three right behind you!</i>

1377
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:32,201
I can't lose 'em!

1378
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:41,004
Whoo! Yeah!

1379
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:56,008
Whoo! I like this!

1380
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:07,683
Blow that piece of junk out of the sky!

1381
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:09,245
All fighters!

1382
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:18,084
Chewie, peel off from the battle.

1383
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:19,605
Draw them away from the speeders.

1384
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:27,050
She drew 'em off! All of 'em!

1385
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:28,804
Oh, they hate that ship!

1386
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:42,401
Chewie!

1387
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:14,761
There it is!

1388
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:21,087
That is a big gun.

1389
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:22,526
<i>Okay, it's heavily armored.</i>

1390
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:24,683
Our only shot is right down the throat.

1391
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,244
The cannon's opening. This is our chance.

1392
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,561
All firepower on those speeders.

1393
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:38,206
Concentrate all fire on the speeders!

1394
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:46,520
We're taking heavy losses.

1395
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:00,809
They're picking us all off.
We're not gonna make it.

1396
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,690
<i>All right, making my final approach.</i>

1397
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:04,251
<i>Target in sight, guns are hot.</i>

1398
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,640
No! Pull off!

1399
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:06,847
What?

1400
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,451
The cannon is charged! It's a suicide run!

1401
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:09,965
<i>All craft, pull away!</i>

1402
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:12,202
- No! I'm almost there!
- <i>Retreat, Finn!</i>

1403
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:13,600
That's an order!

1404
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:24,762
Finn? It's too late! Don't do this!

1405
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:26,923
No! I won't let them win!

1406
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:30,928
No! Finn, listen to Poe!

1407
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:32,525
<i>We have to retreat!</i>

1408
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:47,006
<i>The cannon is warming up now.</i>

1409
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:48,366
<i>Copy that. We see it.</i>

1410
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,284
<i>Preparing to fire.</i>

1411
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:33,923
Move! Go, go! Quick!

1412
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,764
Let's go, let's go!

1413
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,366
Rose?

1414
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,127
Rose?

1415
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:51,931
Rose?

1416
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:54,680
Why would you do that? Huh?

1417
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:56,649
I was almost there.

1418
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:58,931
Why would you stop me?

1419
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:01,808
I saved you,

1420
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:03,841
dummy.

1421
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:06,644
That's how we're gonna win.

1422
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,201
Not fighting what we hate,

1423
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:12,007
saving what we love.

1424
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:32,805
General Hux,

1425
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,530
advance.

1426
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:36,564
No quarter.

1427
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:39,530
No prisoners.

1428
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:44,523
Our distress signal's been
received at multiple points,

1429
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:46,762
but no response.

1430
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:49,084
They've heard us,

1431
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,568
but no one's coming.

1432
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:58,082
We fought till the end.

1433
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:05,361
But the galaxy has lost all its hope.

1434
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:08,165
The spark

1435
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,571
is out.

1436
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:38,730
Luke.

1437
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:49,766
I know what you're gonna say.

1438
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:52,803
I changed my hair.

1439
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:56,484
It's nice that way.

1440
02:07:58,320 --> 02:07:59,970
Leia,

1441
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:02,121
I'm sorry.

1442
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:04,163
I know.

1443
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:06,567
I know you are.

1444
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:09,328
I'm just glad you're here

1445
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,810
at the end.

1446
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:15,043
I came to face him, Leia.

1447
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:19,282
And I can't save him.

1448
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:22,928
I held out hope for so long,

1449
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:28,251
but I know my son is gone.

1450
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:31,851
No one's ever really gone.

1451
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,283
Master Luke.

1452
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:33,321
Stop!

1453
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:02,487
I want every gun we have to fire on that man.

1454
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:09,131
Do it.

1455
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:26,887
More!

1456
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:31,161
More!

1457
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:47,370
That's enough.

1458
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:51,007
That's enough!

1459
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:58,570
Do you think you got him?

1460
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:01,723
Now, if we're ready to get moving,

1461
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:04,087
we can finish this.

1462
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:05,367
Sir?

1463
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,171
Bring me down to him.

1464
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:36,360
Keep the door covered
and don't advance until I say.

1465
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:37,441
Supreme Leader,

1466
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:39,400
don't get distracted, our goal...

1467
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:43,120
Right away, sir.

1468
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:45,765
Med pack!

1469
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:48,008
I need a med pack!

1470
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:50,248
She's hurt pretty bad.

1471
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,286
It's Kylo Ren.

1472
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:11,686
Luke's facing him alone.

1473
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,205
Well, we should help him. Let's go.

1474
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:15,084
No, wait. Wait.

1475
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:31,407
Did you come back to say you forgive me?

1476
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,289
To save my soul?

1477
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:37,644
No.

1478
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:58,762
He's doing this for a reason.

1479
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:02,360
He's stalling so we can escape.

1480
02:13:02,440 --> 02:13:03,440
Escape?

1481
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:04,600
He's one man against an army.

1482
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:06,205
We have to help him, we have to fight.

1483
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:08,560
No, no. We are the spark
that'll light the fire

1484
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:10,244
that'll burn the First Order down.

1485
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:14,443
Skywalker's doing this so we can survive.

1486
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:16,080
There's gotta be a way out of this mine.

1487
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,321
Hell, how did he get in here?

1488
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:21,531
Sir, it is possible that
a natural unmapped opening exists.

1489
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:24,690
But this facility is such
a maze of endless tunnels

1490
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:26,560
that the odds of finding an exit

1491
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:29,320
- are 15,428...
- Shh. Shush. Hush. Shush up.

1492
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:30,970
Shut up!

1493
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:33,890
- To one.
- Listen.

1494
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:38,802
My audio sensors no longer detect the...

1495
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:40,041
Exactly.

1496
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:48,651
Where'd the crystal critters go?

1497
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:55,321
Follow me.

1498
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:01,848
What are you looking at me for?

1499
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,491
Follow him.

1500
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:17,600
If the beacon's right beneath us,
they've got to be somewhere.

1501
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:19,280
Keep scanning for life forms.

1502
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:30,605
This way.

1503
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:36,810
I see them! Chewie, there!

1504
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:53,370
No. No, no, no.

1505
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:57,761
No!

1506
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,843
Lifting rocks.

1507
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:54,446
I failed you, Ben.

1508
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:57,647
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sure you are!

1509
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,882
The Resistance is dead.

1510
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:02,610
The war is over.

1511
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,803
And when I kill you,

1512
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:07,406
I will have killed the last Jedi.

1513
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:08,687
Amazing.

1514
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:13,006
Every word of what you just said was wrong.

1515
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:18,489
The Rebellion is reborn today.

1516
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:22,683
The war

1517
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:24,524
is just beginning.

1518
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:29,611
And I will not be the last Jedi.

1519
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:11,448
I'll destroy her,

1520
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:13,648
and you,

1521
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:15,450
and all of it.

1522
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:20,281
No.

1523
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:24,643
Strike me down in anger
and I'll always be with you.

1524
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:29,362
Just like your father.

1525
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:19,801
No.

1526
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:26,248
See you around, kid.

1527
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:41,331
No!

1528
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:20,800
C'ai!

1529
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:22,848
Such a friend.

1530
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:24,920
Chewie!

1531
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:28,004
It looks good.

1532
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:29,601
That was crazy, man.

1533
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:32,531
- Hi.
- Hi.

1534
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:34,167
I'm Poe.

1535
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,001
Rey.

1536
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:37,407
I know.

1537
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:51,720
When we get to the Outer Rim,
I have a contact there.

1538
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:53,040
Quite definitely possible.

1539
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:05,011
Luke is gone.

1540
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:07,291
I felt it.

1541
02:22:07,880 --> 02:22:09,723
But it wasn't sadness or pain.

1542
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,321
It was peace and purpose.

1543
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:15,611
I felt it, too.

1544
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:21,204
How do we build a Rebellion from this?

1545
02:22:25,640 --> 02:22:28,371
We have everything we need.

1546
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,809
Luke Skywalker,

1547
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:51,769
Jedi Master.
