1
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,930
<i>This is the Earth at a time...</i>

2
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,890
<i>when the dinosaurs roamed a
lush and fertile planet.</i>

3
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,730
<i>A piece of rock just six miles wide</i>

4
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,740
<i>changed all that.</i>

5
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,500
<i>It hit with the force of
10,000 nuclear weapons.</i>

6
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,100
<i>A trillion tons of dirt and rock
hurtled into the atmosphere,</i>

7
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,100
<i>creating a suffocating blanket of dust...</i>

8
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,680
<i>the sun was powerless to penetrate...</i>

9
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,190
<i>for a thousand years.</i>

10
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,230
<i>It happened before.</i>

11
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,780
<i>It will happen again.</i>

12
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,610
<i>It's just a question of when.</i>

13
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,600
Houston, affirmative.

14
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,860
Now try again.

15
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,020
Almost got it.

16
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,030
<i>- Dennis, I'm almost there.</i>
- Houston, Pete's lookin' real strong.

17
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,450
Okay, Pete, we got that
coupling on the board here now.

18
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,880
We'll give you the go-ahead from
down here when it's in alignment.

19
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,840
Sounds good. Give me ten seconds.

20
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,500
His heart rate's racing. Hey, Pete.

21
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,550
- It's Truman.
- Hey.

22
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,050
- How you doing up there, Hoss?
- Pretty good.

23
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,190
Listen, Pete, we got an eye on your meds
here. I'll give you a buffalo nickel

24
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,900
if you'll calm down just a little bit.

25
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,860
- Can you do that for me?
- Whatever you say.

26
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,390
Okay, now, we got plenty of time,
buddy, so don't you worry.

27
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,200
Looking good here.

28
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,030
He'll be all right.

29
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,530
- Go ahead, Atlantis.
<i>- Roger that, Houston.</i>

30
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,040
Suggest we start reeling Pete in.

31
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,630
What the hell is that?

32
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,040
My Lord.

33
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,890
We're down!

34
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,100
Houston!

35
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,060
We've lost all contact.

36
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,830
Stewart, play that tape back!

37
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,790
Houston!

38
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,460
Multiple bogies! Multiple bogies!

39
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,420
Sector five, niner. I have three. Now five.

40
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,670
Unidentified tracks. My screen's full.

41
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,590
Multiple tracks headed toward
the Atlantic seaboard!

42
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,340
This could be a surprise missile attack.

43
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,310
Mr. President, the shuttle
Atlantis just exploded in space.

44
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,770
Okay, I want three groups!
One: internal malfunction.

45
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,440
Get the log tape. Start working back.
Maybe it's a glitch.

46
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,820
Two: I want NORAD, Space
Command and the 50th tactical,

47
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,191
comparing all the space junk
you tracked in every orbit.

48
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,160
I want you to check, recheck
and then do it all over again.

49
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,290
Number three: wild cards.
Anything and everything.

50
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,620
All right? Now, Big Ross, get on the
telephone. Wake up 11,000 people.

51
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,620
Walt, get 'em going. Let's go!

52
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,540
Karl. Karl! Karl.

53
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,470
Karl! Your Stouffer's pot pie's...

54
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,840
been on the table almost ten hours.

55
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,510
- I want a divorce.
- Dottie, I'm on to something big here.

56
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,810
I don't know what this is, but it looks
like something's burnin' up there.

57
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,186
Go get my phone book, will you?
Get my phone book.

58
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:08,860
Get those names of those guys from NASA.

59
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,730
Excuse me! Am I wearing a sign
that says, "Karl's Slave"?

60
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,870
Go get my goddamn phone book!

61
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,490
Get the book! Get the book! Get the book!

62
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,920
Space Command is reporting negative.
That is zero global launches.

63
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,210
It might just be a piece of the
shuttle breaking up as it comes in.

64
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,504
It might be Santa Claus.

65
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:35,170
Until we get definitive,
reliable confirmation, General,

66
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,840
we go to DEFCON three.

67
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,020
Hey, little man! Little Richard!

68
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,870
Me and you, man! We're
going to the top, baby!

69
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,160
Big time! I ain't gonna be ridin'
this bike for the rest of my life.

70
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,531
You know what I'm sayin'? I'm
gettin' a motorcycle, baby.

71
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,790
We're gonna travel in style.

72
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,290
Watch where you're goin'. I bet you,
none of you all stop for brothers.

73
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,842
Slow down, Little Richard.

74
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:20,720
You've been ridin' all morning.
You gotta take a dump?

75
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,336
<i>We interrupt our regularly
scheduled programme...</i>

76
00:06:24,337 --> 00:06:25,600
What happened?

77
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,360
To bring you this special report.
Shh, shh, shh.

78
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,730
<i>The shuttle Atlantis exploded in space
at 3:47 a.m., Eastern Standard Time.</i>

79
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,910
Hey! Get, get.

80
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,830
- That's my Godzilla. Come on, now.
- Yo, fool!

81
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,080
Don't be kickin' Little Richard.
What the hell your problem?

82
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,080
That dog's eatin' my Godzilla. What's a
little runt like you gonna do about it?

83
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,590
Get him, Richard. Sic him.
If I wasn't no Christian,

84
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,580
I'd be throwin' your fat pineappleeatin'
ass through the window.

85
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,100
- Why we not going?
- You know why? 'Cause this is New York City.

86
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,480
Anything could happen. Let's see.
Could've been a terrorist bomb.

87
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,450
Could've been a dead body. Somebody
shot, stabbed, and it's friday, payday.

88
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,930
Dude, somebody probably didn't
get their paycheck. Yes?

89
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:21,530
I want to go shopping.

90
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,120
Me, too, but we ain't goin' nowhere
'cause this is a traffic jam.

91
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,330
Little Richard! Right over there!

92
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,460
Little Richard!

93
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,460
Hang on, Little Richard. I'm comin'!

94
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,043
Don't you worry about it.

95
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:37,640
I'm gonna get you outta there!

96
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,050
You okay, buddy? Don't worry about it.
Hang in there.

97
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,140
Somebody dial 911!

98
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,180
My screen's full. They're
all over the place.

99
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,810
Bogies are breachin' the atmosphere from
Finland down the North American seaboard.

100
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,360
Whoa!

101
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,000
Look at that!

102
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,170
Oh, we at war!

103
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,210
Saddam Hussein is bombing us!

104
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,689
Let's stay focused. We need
to map the trajectory now.

105
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,560
That could take a week.

106
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,150
Just find it, okay? I wanna know if the
worst is over or if it's on its way.

107
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,940
We've got General Kimsey on the line.

108
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,650
We've got hits from Finland
to South Carolina.

109
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,660
We know they're not missiles.
Now what the hell is it?

110
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,160
It's a meteor shower. That's
what took out the shuttle.

111
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,580
I've got the president on Air
Force One demanding answers.

112
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,090
Is it over?

113
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,300
General, we've got 11,000 people at NASA
trying to figure that out right now.

114
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,800
When we know, you'll know.

115
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,776
Okay, Karl, listen. I want you
to take your time. Yes, sir.

116
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:51,970
You're definitely the first.

117
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,180
Okay, first coordinate. One-two-three-nine.
1239, right?

118
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,860
FBI locked his location.
Saw an explosion in space.

119
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,160
Okay.

120
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,780
Listen, Karl, this is top secret.
Sir, I'm retired Navy.

121
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,360
I know all about classified.
But one more thing.

122
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,820
The person that finds her
gets to name her, right?

123
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,363
Yes, that's right.

124
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:16,170
I wanna name her Dottie, after my wife.

125
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,300
She's a vicious lifesuckin' bitch
from which there's no escape.

126
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,010
- That's sweet, Karl.
- SDI, this is flight director!

127
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,165
I wanna get that Hubble
movin', and I want it now.

128
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:25,840
Roger that.

129
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,800
We're movin' the Hubble!

130
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,690
It's enormous.

131
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,820
This is the anomaly at 1643.

132
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,330
Here is the anomaly at 1658,

133
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,860
and here is the anomaly at 1700.

134
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,490
Enough with this anomaly horseshit!

135
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,000
What is this thing? It's an asteroid, sir.

136
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,920
How big are we talking?

137
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,500
Sir, our best estimate is 97.6 billion.

138
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,510
- It's the size of Texas, Mr. President.
- Ye... Yes, sir.

139
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,340
Dan, we didn't see this thing coming?

140
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,680
Well, our object collision
budget's a million dollars.

141
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,011
That allows us to track about
three percent of the sky.

142
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,390
And begging your pardon,
sir, it's a bigass sky.

143
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,715
And the ones this morning?

144
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:16,020
Those are nothing. They're
the size of basketballs...

145
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,020
and Volkswagens, things like that.

146
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,700
-Is this going to hit us? 
- We're efforting that as we speak, sir.

147
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,400
- What kind of damage are we...?
- Damage?

148
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,740
Total, sir.

149
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,280
It's what we call a global killer.

150
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,540
The end of mankind.

151
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,780
Doesn't matter where it hits.

152
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,080
Nothing would survive. Not even bacteria.

153
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,290
My God. What do we do?

154
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,470
We have 18 days before it hits Earth.

155
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,180
- Have mercy.
- Rise and shine!

156
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,910
Stop the drilling! Stop the drilling!
Stop the drilling!

157
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,570
Fore!

158
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,580
Stop the drilling! Stop the drilling!

159
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,590
Hey! Hey, that was close!

160
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,340
I give you 50 000 a year in donations.

161
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,018
What do you think they're
so mad about, Chick?

162
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:29,840
Well, I think they feel...

163
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,180
that drilling for oil is an evil thing.

164
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,930
You know how much diesel that
clunker boat pumps out an hour?

165
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,260
I just found out something interesting.
Number two chewed 180 feet last night.

166
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,820
Who do we have to thank for this?
I'll give you two guesses.

167
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,350
But you're only gonna need one.

168
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,820
Goddamn it, A.J.!

169
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,990
A.J.!

170
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,490
A.J.! A.J., you in here?

171
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,120
Oh, that's just perfect. In bed. Get up!

172
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,300
Uh, hey, you wanted to see me?
Yeah, I was lookin' for ya.

173
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,290
You're pissed. Okay, I can see that.

174
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,300
No. You know what, A.J.? I'm not pissed.
You've seen me pissed.

175
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,168
This is way, way beyond pissed, though.

176
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:10,210
You know I shut down number
two last night, right?

177
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,790
- Yeah, man, I had a hunch on that.
- Let me tell you something.

178
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,680
Someday, many years from now,
when you're all growned up,

179
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,562
and you got your own oil company

180
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,190
and $8 million of your own
money on the contract,

181
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,850
you can do whatever comes into that little
A.J. idiotin' mind of yours you want.

182
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,390
But as long as it says "Harry Stamper Oil"
on the rig, you will not disobey my rules.

183
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,320
- You got that?
- Yeah, I do got it.

184
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,910
All right, now I need to
hear five words from you.

185
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,160
- Uh...
- I'll

186
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,320
never do that again.

187
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,820
I'm a fool. That was idiotic.
I mean, that was stupid.

188
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,590
I'm an idiot. I know what
name's on the sign. I'm not.

189
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,500
What's goin' on here? What's goin' on?

190
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,420
Well, ll mean, you know, I screwed up.
I'm a little edgy.

191
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,670
- How long you work for me?
- Five wonderful years.

192
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,340
In five years, you have never
apologized to me this quickly.

193
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,390
Something's going on here. I'm
gonna find out what it is.

194
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,020
Well, I'm turning over a new leaf.
I'm trying to learn from the man.

195
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,180
What would Harry do?

196
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,780
I'm at a loss for words.

197
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,370
Okay, I can explain this.

198
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,070
You can explain that? I can.

199
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,740
I would really like an explanation.
You just stay right here.

200
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,370
Grace?

201
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,926
Hi, Harry.

202
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:26,714
I have asked you
repeatedly to call me Dad.

203
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,980
Sorry, Harry.

204
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,550
Get up and get your clothes on.

205
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,880
You just stay right there.
I'll be right back.

206
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,201
Here's what we're gonna do.

207
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:47,890
I want every strategy we've got
on nearEarth object collision.

208
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,057
Okay? Any ideas, any programs,

209
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:53,540
anything you sketched on a
pizza box or cocktail napkin.

210
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,539
For 30 years, they questioned
the need for NASA.

211
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,419
Today, we're gonna give 'em the answer.

212
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,630
You know about this, Rockhound?

213
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,590
- You knew?
- No, I had no idea.

214
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,760
Where's Harry?

215
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,590
Harry, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I understand, okay?

216
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,180
You're mad. WhoWho wouldn't be mad?

217
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,270
He's gonna shoot you. Nah, no, he's not.

218
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,470
Oh, shit.

219
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,520
- Harry!
- What's wrong with you?

220
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,770
Make your peace with God, A.J.!

221
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,940
This guy's got a gun, man.
He's shooting at me.

222
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,840
Harry, this is not funny!

223
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,084
Harry, listen to me!
We can talk this over!

224
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,290
- Oh, is this a serious thing?
- Yeah, pretty serious.

225
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,910
- Bear!
- What's up?

226
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,370
He's shootin' at me. You see Harry
comin', crack him with that wrench.

227
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,670
You told A.J.'s dad just before he died
that you would take care of the boy.

228
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,840
Now I'm not sure that shootin'
him is takin' care of him.

229
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,268
Why don't you put the gun down?

230
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:49,170
- You don't want none of this.
- Get out of my way.

231
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,460
Just tryin' to give my man
a head start, that's all.

232
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,470
Not to mention the fact that I don't think
you wanna kill the best man on your crew...

233
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,630
- before we strike oil.
- Aw, Chick, I ain't gonna kill him.

234
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,810
Just gonna take a foot off. A
man can work with one foot.

235
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,621
You remember old Frank Marx who
worked with one hand all them years?

236
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,070
Yeah, but he wasn't very good.

237
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,030
Harry, put the gun down!
You're acting insane!

238
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,530
Now, honey, go get some clothes
on and get out of the way.

239
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,150
- You can't control my life!
- Fine. Clothes. Now!

240
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,264
All right, stop! All right!

241
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,305
It was funny for a minute.
It's not funny any more.

242
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Fuck! Harry, this is illegal, man.

243
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,330
I'm temporarily insane, Rock.
It's all right.

244
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,090
- Do I look like I'm crazy to you?
- Well...

245
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,340
Harry! Hey, just cool down.

246
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,692
What are you doing? Harry, stop!
Cut it out.

247
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:36,510
All right, Harry.

248
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,770
All right, now, listen. Man to man.
I'm serious. I love her.

249
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,720
Way wrong answer!

250
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,360
- Whoa, whoa, Harry. It's gettin' real.
- Harry! Come on, Harry!

251
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,190
- You shot me!
- You shot him.

252
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,190
That bullet never got close.
Just a ricochet.

253
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,680
You know, it's all funny till
somebody gets shot in the leg!

254
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,610
Hey, pucker up. We got clients incoming.

255
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,040
Uh, b-back in-in in 1974,

256
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,334
we-we first got the idea

257
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:08,620
the-the possibility that-that
a meteor or an asteroid

258
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,250
I need somebody who's had a little less
caffeine this morning. Doc, translate.

259
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:16,380
Yes, sir. Our first feasibility plan was
to use a spreadfocus laser generator...

260
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,420
to heat the object to
the point of fracture.

261
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,801
That's like shooting a BB-gun
at a freight train, Doc.

262
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,810
Uh, some of us have got this idea.

263
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,440
We wanna land a craft, deploy solar sails.

264
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:32,110
You'll have a big canopy. Solar winds
will be caught by these Mylar sails.

265
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,990
Okay Come on, guys!

266
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,820
We gotta come up with something
realistic here. We got 18 days.

267
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,620
That's 431 hours, 15
minutes and 18 seconds.

268
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,410
Time's a luxury we don't have. What?

269
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,330
Listen, Harry, A.J. is my choice.

270
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,716
My choice and not yours.

271
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:53,920
He's the only one in
your age bracket, Grace.

272
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,920
It's not a choice. It's a lack of options.

273
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,390
I don't know what in the
world makes you think...

274
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,180
that you have the right to tell
me what to do any more, Harry.

275
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,190
I suppose being your
father doesn't count, huh?

276
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,850
Not really. Since when?

277
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,430
Since I reached the age of ten and
became older than you, Harry.

278
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,440
Since Mom split. Why don't
you take your pick?

279
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,023
Look, I understand that you are
handicapped by natural immaturity,

280
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:16,024
and I forgive you.

281
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,240
I may be an immature father,
but I'm still your employer.

282
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,381
And as your boss, I want you
on that crew boat tonight

283
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:22,500
and back in the office by Monday.

284
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,710
You got that? Okay. I quit.

285
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,620
Grace, you can't quit now!

286
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,000
I need you to keep on working.

287
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,880
Hi, Harry!

288
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,170
What are you smilin' about?

289
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,800
I've been seein' A.J. for
more than five months, Harry.

290
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,390
You little hypocrite. I ever held
you back once from doing anything?

291
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,400
What about having a life, Harry?

292
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,008
The first time I got my period,

293
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,360
Rockhound had to take me
into Taipei for Tampax...

294
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,530
and then he had to show
me how to use 'em, Harry.

295
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,530
Hoho.

296
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,870
I ju... No, I-I told her how to use it.
I didn't show her, Harry.

297
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,870
I was playing with titanium depth gauges
when I should've been playing with dolls.

298
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,210
I mean, I learned about the birds and
the bees from Freddie Noonan's tattoos.

299
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,010
Look, I was raised on roughnecks by you.

300
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,670
And now you get all shocked and
shaken when I fall in love with one.

301
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,722
So who's the hypocrite here, Harry, huh?

302
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:18,840
Look at those nice pipes.

303
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,720
- Listen to me, Grace.
- No, you listen to me, Harry. I grew up.

304
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,010
With the proximity of the
asteroid and no prep time,

305
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,350
none of our primary plans can work.

306
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,890
Why don't we just send up 150 nuclear
warheads and blast that rock apart?

307
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,770
Terrible idea.

308
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,110
Was I talkin' to you?

309
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,030
This is Dr. Ronald Quincy from Research.

310
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,900
Pretty much the smartest man on the planet.
You might wanna listen to him.

311
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,580
General, if you consider your target,

312
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,080
her composition, her dimensions,

313
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,080
her sheer velocity,

314
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,805
you could fire every
nuke you've got on her,

315
00:19:51,806 --> 00:19:54,170
she'll just smile at you
and keep on coming.

316
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,220
You should know that the
president's scientific advisors...

317
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,130
are suggesting that a nuclear blast could
change this asteroid's trajectory.

318
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,890
I know the president's chief scientific
advisor. We were at MIT together.

319
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,260
And, in a situation like this,

320
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,560
you really don't wanna take the advice
from a man who got a C- in astrophysics.

321
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:16,900
The president's advisors are wrong.
I'm right.

322
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,660
Hitting the rock from the
outside won't do the job.

323
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,990
Imagine a firecracker in
the palm of your hand.

324
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,570
You set it off. What happens?
Burn your hand, right?

325
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,880
You close your fist around the
same firecracker and set it off

326
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,170
poof your wife's gonna be opening your
ketchup bottles the rest of your life.

327
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,780
Are you suggesting that we blow
this thing up from the inside?

328
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,790
That's exactly what I'm saying. How?

329
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,380
We drill.

330
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,600
We bring in the world's
best deepcore driller.

331
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,590
Harry, get up here. We're takin' a hit.

332
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,300
Get A.J. up here! Come on!

333
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,270
Oh, shit!

334
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,600
Send another pipe down! Right now!

335
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,650
It's a gas pocket!

336
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,020
I told you! Am I lucky,
or am I just a genius?

337
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,160
I shut it down for a reason, you jackass!
The relief valve's...

338
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,490
Shut off the number two valve! Grace,
get the clients out of here now!

339
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,160
No, Daddy!

340
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,470
Chick, get 'em outta here!
Get 'em off the rig now!

341
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,550
Get the hell down! This
thing is gonna blow.

342
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,020
Chick, get down now!

343
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,320
Get down!

344
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,410
<i>Three dozen research calls, and every
time, the same man is recommended.</i>

345
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,830
<i>He's worked on every terrain
this planet can offer.</i>

346
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,740
<i>Whenever they said it couldn't
be drilled, this guy drilled it.</i>

347
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,910
Everybody all right? We struck oil, baby!

348
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,500
Somebody could've got killed out here
today. You want that on your conscience?

349
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,090
High thumb. You are man, Harry.

350
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,920
Thumbs high.

351
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,560
You're fired.

352
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,010
Who's Harry Stamper?

353
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,350
Hey, I'm Harry Stamper.
What's all this about?

354
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,570
Mr. Stamper, I'm General Montgomery,
commander of the Pacific air forces.

355
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,400
I've been sent here by the
secretary of defense

356
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,110
on direct orders from the
president of the United States.

357
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,370
It's a matter of urgent national security.

358
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,620
I need you to get on that chopper
right now, no questions asked.

359
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,750
Crazy Willie put you up to this?

360
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,260
I'm afraid I don't know Crazy Willie, sir.
I'm dead serious about this.

361
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,040
- Harry.
- What?

362
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,090
I swear to God, she never told me her age.

363
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,560
It's all right. Relax. It's about me.

364
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,050
Oh. Forget it!

365
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,310
All right, General, I'll go
with you, on one condition.

366
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,320
We're gonna have to take my daughter along.

367
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,460
What did I do?

368
00:23:05,461 --> 00:23:07,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where
you guys takin' her?

369
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,570
- Sir, stay right here.
- Wh...

370
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,620
Chick, get him paid, get him off the rig!

371
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,000
- Mr. Stamper?
- Yeah, I'm Harry Stamper.

372
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,430
How you doin'? Miss Stamper.

373
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,430
I'm Dan Truman, Executive Director here.

374
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,217
Listen, on behalf of all of us,
I'd really like to apologize.

375
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:32,770
Apologize.

376
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,260
I don't know if we can take any
more apologies, Mr. Truman.

377
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,810
We've been apologized to for
the last 18,5 hours.

378
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,940
So if you don't mind, how about
if we just get on with it?

379
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,940
You tell us why we're here
at the NASA Space Center.

380
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,150
We should probably talk alone.

381
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,820
Mr. Truman, I don't keep any
secrets from my daughter, Grace.

382
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,826
So whether you tell her
now or I tell her later,

383
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:51,320
she's gonna find out one way or the other.

384
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,330
So why don't we just get on with it?

385
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,330
So when the Rogue comet hit the asteroid
belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.

386
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,670
For the next 15 days, the
Earth's in a shooting gallery.

387
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,630
Even if the asteroid itself hits the
water, it's still hitting land.

388
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,510
It'll flash boil millions of gallons of
seawater and slam into the ocean bedrock.

389
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,980
Now, if it's a Pacific Ocean
impact which we think it will be

390
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,850
it'll create a tidal wave three miles high,

391
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,560
travelling at 1,000 miles an hour covering
California and washing up in Denver.

392
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,230
Japan's gone. Australia's wiped out.

393
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,950
Half the world's population will
be incinerated by the heat blast.

394
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,160
The rest'll freeze to death
from nuclear winter.

395
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,990
That's unbelievable.

396
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,070
Well, actually, this is as real as it gets.

397
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,000
Well, it's coming right now.

398
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,260
Right for us at 22,000 miles an hour.

399
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,590
Not a soul on Earth can hide from it.

400
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,530
I take it you're not
alerting everyone like this.

401
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,410
Nobody knows. That's the way it stays.

402
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,870
For the next ten days, there are
only nine telescopes in the world...

403
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,241
that can spot the asteroid,
and we control eight of 'em.

404
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,290
The president's classified
this information top secret.

405
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,250
If news like this got out,

406
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,710
there'd be an overnight breakdown
of basic social services worldwide.

407
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:29,090
Rioting, mass religious hysteria,
total chaos, you can imagine.

408
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,310
Basically the worst parts of the Bible.

409
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,060
Six billion people on the planet.

410
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,430
Why'd you guys call me?

411
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,816
We need you to prep the
team we're sending up.

412
00:25:42,817 --> 00:25:43,940
Up?

413
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,570
We'll send them to the asteroid, they'll
land, drill a hole, they'll drop some nukes,

414
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,610
take off and detonate, if we can
fix this equipment problem.

415
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,570
The drilling unit's a prototype we've
been building for the Mars project.

416
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,570
You, uh... You might recognize the rig.

417
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,920
Yeah, well, I guess I should recognize it.
It's my design.

418
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,327
Did you steal a key to the Patent Office?

419
00:26:09,328 --> 00:26:10,328
Yeah, basically.

420
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,270
Let me get this straight. I
got pulled off an oil rig,

421
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,430
flown halfway around the world
because you stole my drill design.

422
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,470
Couldn't read the plans right and did a
piss-poor job of putting it together.

423
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,100
Patents don't apply to outer space.
You shut up, Quincy.

424
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,610
It's not going to Mars any more.
It's gonna try to save this planet.

425
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,940
And we need to know what's
wrong with it pretty quick.

426
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,110
You said we did a bad job
of putting it together?

427
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:32,150
No, I said...

428
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,610
you did a piss-poor job
of putting it together.

429
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,990
First of all, you got the flow
system all reversed. Let me guess.

430
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,516
You've been tearin' up rotors
and you can't figure out why.

431
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:41,710
Yeah, that's right.

432
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,380
Well, that's because your cams
are all wrong, Mr. Wizard.

433
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,710
Who's been operating this thing?

434
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,130
Right there. We've actually...

435
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,620
We've had them training for
eight months solid now.

436
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:53,800
Eight whole months?

437
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,390
- Well, pretty much, yeah.
- Well, gee whiz.

438
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,840
Well, this is the team that
has to do the job up there.

439
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,970
We need you to train them down here.

440
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,810
Well, Mr. Stamper, what do you think?

441
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,070
You know, drilling's a science.
It's an art.

442
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,320
I'm a third generation
driller, doin' it all my life.

443
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,650
I still haven't got it all figured out.

444
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,030
I assume you sent for me because
somebody told you I was the best.

445
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,000
Well, I'm only the best
because I work with the best.

446
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,990
You don't trust the men you're working
with, you're as good as dead.

447
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,250
Now you wanna send these
boys into space, fine.

448
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,250
I'm sure they'll make good astronauts,

449
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,050
but they don't know jack about drillin'.

450
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,880
- What's your contingency plan?
- Contingency plan?

451
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,170
Your backup plan. You gotta have
some kind of backup plan, right?

452
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,170
No, we don't have a backup plan.

453
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,180
- This is it.
- This is the best that you could,

454
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,680
that the, the government, the U.S.
government can come up with.

455
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,020
I mean, you're NASA for cryin' out loud.
You put a man on the moon.

456
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,400
You're geniuses. You're the
guys that think this shit up.

457
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,020
I'm sure you got a team of men
sittin' around somewhere right now,

458
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,490
just thinkin' shit up and
somebody backin' them up.

459
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,012
You tell me you don't have a backup plan,

460
00:27:54,013 --> 00:27:55,240
that these eight Boy Scouts right here,

461
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,677
that is the world's hope,
that's what you're tellin' me?

462
00:27:58,678 --> 00:27:59,780
Yeah.

463
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,540
Oh, Jesus. Damn it.

464
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:06,160
We're a little short on time here.
Will you help us?

465
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,590
All they gotta do is drill? That's it.

466
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,946
No spacewalkin', no crazy astronaut stuff.

467
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:17,060
Just drill.

468
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,190
How many men were you
plannin' on takin' up there?

469
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,270
We're sendin' up two shuttles, two teams.

470
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,720
If I do this, I'm gonna
wanna take my own men.

471
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,310
You got it.

472
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,400
So you're saying you'll help us? Yes, sir.

473
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,570
Thanks.

474
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,490
I just don't trust anybody
else to do it, that's all.

475
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,960
No, Mrs. Curlene.

476
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,750
It's Harry Stamper. You see Bear, you
tell him Harry's lookin' for him.

477
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,430
Those guys get off this rig, they scatter.

478
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,430
J. Otis Curlene "Bear".

479
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,260
Probably the only black man on a
big dog in Kadoka, South Dakota.

480
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,850
Come and get Papa Bear!

481
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,190
- Uh, Max.
- You got a weight limit on the shuttle?

482
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,950
- Max.
- Hey, Mama.

483
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,110
So sweet, Maxie.

484
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,580
Hey, would you give me one of them
yellow jelly bear claws I like?

485
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,450
- Are you in trouble with the law again?
- No, Mama.

486
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,950
- Maxie.
- I swear, Mama. I'm...

487
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,149
You know I want Rockhound.

488
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,120
We call him Hound because,
well, he's horny.

489
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,550
You might wanna start with
every bar in New Orleans.

490
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,220
That is a big, shiny mount, isn't it?

491
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,640
How long you been married? For two weeks.

492
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,400
See this diamond? Yeah.

493
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,450
It's not a diamond.

494
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,310
Would you like another drink? Yeah.

495
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,240
- Sir, FBI.
- So cute. No, thanks.

496
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,030
- We have a national security matter.
- Good for you.

497
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,700
Let's go. Now.

498
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,700
How old are you?

499
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,330
Oscar Choice. Spacy but
absolutely brilliant geologist.

500
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,330
He owns a horse ranch outside of El Paso.

501
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
What the...

502
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,510
Mr. Chick Chapel, at the craps table.

503
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,760
Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas, Nevada.

504
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,680
Yes! About time.

505
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,170
Charles Chapel, game's over.

506
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,520
Who's gonna run the other rig?
How about Benny? He's good.

507
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,780
The only one who knows how to
run it as well as I do is A.J.

508
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,230
I thought you said you couldn't trust him.

509
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,190
I thought you said I could.

510
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,240
Yep, you are on your way, A.J.

511
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,070
Well, being in business for
yourself has its advantages.

512
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,960
Make my own hours, nobody
shoots me in the leg.

513
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,540
You don't got a gun on you now, do you?

514
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,800
Oh, good, 'cause I kinda wanted to
get back to this whole thing...

515
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,420
about you askin' me for help.

516
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,260
Does that mean that there's a job...

517
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:04,890
that Mr. All-Go-No-Quit-Big-Nuts
Harry Stamper...

518
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,890
can't handle by himself and
needs my expert advice?

519
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,560
Somethin' like that, yeah.

520
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,570
Well, no, no, no, no, no.

521
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,940
I mean, is it something
like that, or is it that?

522
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,070
You know, you and me got a real problem.

523
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,940
You know, Harry, there are only...

524
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,400
five words I wanna hear from you right now.

525
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,280
Those words are:

526
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,750
You know, A.J., I really look up to you.

527
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,040
You've been a hero of mine for a long time,

528
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:33,790
and I'm very impressed with your work.

529
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,288
I'm emotionally closed off.

530
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:37,670
That's like... That's like
11 words or something.

531
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,590
You know what? How about
just, "A.J., I'm sorry",

532
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,010
- "and I love ya."
- You know, A.J.,

533
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,980
there's not a job on the planet
I want you to work with me on.

534
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,940
I mean that.

535
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,450
So what are you doin' here?
Harry, what's the job?

536
00:31:59,557 --> 00:32:00,557
Hey, Bear.

537
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,200
What's up, baby? Yeah, baby.
What's up? What's up?

538
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,380
What's up, Harry? Did NASA
find oil on Uranus, man?

539
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,510
None of you have to go. We
can all just sit here on Earth,

540
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,470
wait for this big rock to crash into it

541
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,880
and kill everything and everybody we know.

542
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,810
The United States government
just asked us to save the world.

543
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,520
Anybody wanna say no? Twenty years.

544
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:41,160
Haven't turned you down once.
I'm not about to start now.

545
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,370
I'm there.

546
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,520
Guess I can't let you go up there alone.

547
00:32:45,521 --> 00:32:46,530
I'm with you.

548
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,910
I mean, this is, this is historic.

549
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,920
Guys, this is like deep blue hero stuff.

550
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,000
Of course I'm in.

551
00:32:55,090 --> 00:33:00,000
While I don't share his
enthusiasm, you know me.

552
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,590
Beam me up, Scotty.

553
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,510
- You all right, Max?
- I-I don't, I-I don't...

554
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,390
Whatever you think.

555
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,020
- What about you?
- I'm in.

556
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,020
All right, then.

557
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,190
We go.

558
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,280
I don't mean to be the materialistic
weasel of this group,

559
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,740
but you think we'll get
hazard pay out of this?

560
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,360
If you're trying to make me feel better
about this scenario, give it up.

561
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,780
To tell you the truth, I'm kind of
encouraged. This guy Chick here...

562
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,040
was an Air Force commando for six years.

563
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,090
We got robbery, assault,
arrest, resisting arrest.

564
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,988
We got a collection agent for the mob.

565
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:39,710
Two of these guys have done serious time.

566
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,880
- Look, they're the best at what they do.
- So am I.

567
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,880
And I'm not so optimistic.

568
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,060
We spend $250 billion a year on defence.

569
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,720
And here we are. The fate of
the planet is in the hands...

570
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,430
of a bunch of retards I wouldn't
trust with a potato gun.

571
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,393
So what's the verdict?

572
00:33:58,394 --> 00:34:01,650
They'll do it. They've made
a few requests though.

573
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,570
Such as?

574
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,570
Just a few things here.

575
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:15,080
Nothing really big. Just
well, as an example...

576
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:18,280
Uh, Oscar here's got some
outstanding parking tickets.

577
00:34:18,281 --> 00:34:19,920
Wants 'em wiped off his record.

578
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,840
56 tickets in seven states.

579
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,180
- I'll tell him, Oscar. I got it.
- Okay.

580
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,630
Uh, Noonan's got two women friends...

581
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,850
that he'd like to see made American
citizens, no questions asked.

582
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,770
Max would like you to
bring back 8-track tapes.

583
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,520
Not sure if that's gonna work,
but let's see what else.

584
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:44,440
Chick wants a full week's Emperor's
Package at Caesar's Palace.

585
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:47,731
Hey, you guys wouldn't be able to tell us
who actually killed Kennedy, would ya?

586
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,130
Uh, Bear would like to stay at the...

587
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,500
White Horse.

588
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,120
White House. White House.

589
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,060
White House.

590
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:04,460
Yeah, he'd like to stay in the Lincoln
Bedroom of the White House...

591
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,300
for the summer.

592
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,010
Stuff like that.

593
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:12,720
Sure, I think we can take
care of some of that.

594
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,980
Harry!

595
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,810
Yeah, one more thing.

596
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,530
None of them wanna pay taxes again.

597
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,530
Ever.

598
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,340
Who's that for? Mr. Ed?

599
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,580
You stick that in me, I'm gonna
stab you in the heart with it.

600
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,260
You ever see Pulp Fiction?

601
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,210
Uhoh.

602
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,020
We're losin' him, we're losin' him.
Clear! Kaboom!

603
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,050
Freddie, you all right?
Does this look okay to you?

604
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:57,350
Does this look okay? It's not all bad.
It's kinda tingly.

605
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,890
Mr. Chapel, you're next!

606
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,900
Oh, gee, lady, I just came here to drill.

607
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,900
Oh, so did I.

608
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,360
Your triglycerides are way high,

609
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,540
and your bad cholesterol is shockingly bad.

610
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,450
Gotta lay off those pork rinds, Bear!

611
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,260
Pork rinds this! Yeah!

612
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,050
Well, at least they're in good spirits.

613
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,060
Piece of cake. Look, you
wanna compare brain pans?

614
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,930
I won the Westinghouse prize
when I was 12. Big deal.

615
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:41,010
Published at 19. So what? I got a
double doctorate from MIT at 22.

616
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:44,480
Chemistry and geology. I taught at
Princeton for two and a half years.

617
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:48,830
You know, I think this might be the most
uncomfortable room I've ever been in in my life.

618
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,950
Why do I do this? Because the
money's good, the scenery changes,

619
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,450
and they let me use explosives, okay?

620
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,290
Okay, you wanna be all psychological
with me, that's fine.

621
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,960
I'll tell you one thing that
really drives me nuts...

622
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:03,620
is people who think Jethro Tull
is just a person in the band.

623
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,300
Who is Jethro Tull?

624
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,880
My favourite dish is haggis.
Heart, lungs, liver.

625
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:13,260
You shove that all in a sheep's
stomach, then you boil it.

626
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,810
That'll put some hair on your ass.

627
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,310
I am not crazy. I'm just a little
emotional right now, okay?

628
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,110
You're all throwin' all this
stuff at me, man. I mean,

629
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,911
after this is over, could I, like,
get a hug from you or somethin'?

630
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,110
Okay, Cyclops lady is startin' to bug me.

631
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,031
Can you handle it?

632
00:37:29,032 --> 00:37:31,150
I mean, I can handle what
I'm, you know, gonna do.

633
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,160
I can handle that, but I don't
know if I can handle this room.

634
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,160
Woman with large breasts.

635
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,290
Woman with medium breasts.

636
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,290
Here's Harry givin' me a hard time.

637
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,420
And this is Harry tellin'
me it's not good enough.

638
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,863
And this is Harry tellin' me
I can't marry his daughter.

639
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:47,064
Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

640
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,960
Just let it out.

641
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,630
I suffered a major head injury
when I was in high school.

642
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,980
This one looks like you... with breasts.

643
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,180
Yeah, I can handle it.
Yeah, I can handle it.

644
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:04,730
A home run! The Cubs win
the World Series! Ah.

645
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,810
Fail. Fail. Depressively fail.

646
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,320
One toxicology analysis revealed Catamen.

647
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,650
That is a very powerful sedative.

648
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,825
Sedatives are used all the time, Doctor.

649
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:18,080
This one's used on horses.

650
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,670
Some of these guys are pretty big.

651
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,160
It would normally take 18 months
to psychologically prepare,

652
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,750
prescreen viable subjects for space travel.

653
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,340
We have seen evidence of a wide
variety of territorial aggression.

654
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:34,090
Can they physically survive the trip?
That's all I need to know here, okay?

655
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,260
Personally, I don't know how
they survived the tests.

656
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,270
Talk about the wrong stuff.

657
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,610
Good morning. I'm Colonel Willie Sharp.

658
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,530
In addition to flying one of
the X71 teams to that rock,

659
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:57,710
my job is to train you to deal with the mental
and physical rigors of working in space...

660
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,460
so you don't freak out on the asteroid.

661
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:04,910
United States astronauts train for years.

662
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,920
You have 12 days.

663
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,410
Do we have any intelligent
questions before we get started?

664
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,760
What's an X71?

665
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:16,760
You're the first civilians to ever see her.

666
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,890
We call 'em the X71s.

667
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,690
It's a top secret joint
venture with the Air Force.

668
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:25,390
She and her sister ship in Vandenberg
are leaving for launch prep in Florida.

669
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,996
Thought you oughta take a look.

670
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,740
The two shuttles going up are
the Freedom and Independence.

671
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,990
Her titanium alloy impenetrable
skin covers the toughest, meanest,

672
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,120
most sophisticated space
vehicle man has ever made.

673
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,650
Okay, Air Force Colonel
Davis, NASA pilot Tucker...

674
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,660
will command the shuttle Independence.

675
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:44,410
Air Force Colonel Sharp, NASA
pilot Watts, shuttle Freedom.

676
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,800
Munitions specialist Gruber and Halsey
will supervise the nuclear ordinance.

677
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,180
Anyway, I just thought

678
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,430
thought you guys should meet.

679
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,970
Gentlemen, welcome to our weightless
environmental training facility.

680
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,310
So we're going swimming on this asteroid.
Is that what this is for?

681
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,360
Here at downtown NASA, we call
this monster "Armadillo."

682
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,370
Going to be retrofitted
with your drilling arm.

683
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,460
She'll turn 800 turbo
horses in nearzero gravity.

684
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,200
Mind if we take a look at her now?

685
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:24,500
All these rubber hoses gotta go, Max.
Count 'em up.

686
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,460
Make sure it's shortthrow shifters.

687
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,800
Quincy! Somebody tell me what this is.

688
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,970
Plastic ice cream scoop? What'd that cost?
About $400.

689
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:39,470
This is about the sorriest group of people
I've seen in all my entire military career.

690
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,050
Your space flight's gonna be a
brutal assault on your senses.

691
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,057
I'm here to give you a taste of that.

692
00:40:45,058 --> 00:40:47,480
NASA's got some of the
finest pilots in the world.

693
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,650
They're gonna be suckin' your
eyes into the back of your heads.

694
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,650
Go easy on me, okay? It's my first time.

695
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,660
I just wanna seriously say I
have a small fear of flying.

696
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,580
I'm gonna twist ya.

697
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,500
I'm gonna flip ya. What's
the matter with you?

698
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,340
Frap your body till your bones hurt.

699
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,430
When you squeal, I'm just
gonna go faster and harder.

700
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:18,170
No, take me down!

701
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:22,010
How's the rest of the crew? Well, uh.

702
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,680
Sorry about the rib chunks
all over your dashboard.

703
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,400
Don't forget: We gotta x-ray all these.

704
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,150
- If you had to say, who would you say?
- I don't know, Oscar.

705
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,610
Who do you think you are? Han Solo.

706
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,370
No, if anybody's anybody, I'm Han.

707
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,370
And you're you're Chewbacca.

708
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,280
Chewie? Have you even seen Star Wars?

709
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,870
All right, let's go.

710
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:53,040
Neil Armstrong, 1969, bouncing on the moon.

711
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,510
He's bouncing up there because there's
less gravity up there than on Earth.

712
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,470
This will be similar to the
asteroid, so watch it.

713
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,470
Something gets launched off that
asteroid with enough force,

714
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,930
it's gonna keep on going
right into outer space.

715
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,730
What is the deal? Is it just
me, or is Watts really hot?

716
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,730
Yeah.

717
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,770
We have these new generation suits
with directional accelerant thrusters.

718
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,650
You won't bounce like Neil Armstrong.
Yeah, think so?

719
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,410
Bear! Yes?

720
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,570
- Do we have a problem?
- No.

721
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:26,120
'Cause I'm trying to describe to you how
these DATs keep your ass on the ground.

722
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,410
- So that if I were to kick you in the balls.
- Ooh.

723
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,830
And you don't know how to work
them, what happens to you?

724
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,460
- I float away.
- Yeah.

725
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,430
And when do we start training for that?

726
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,010
Gentlemen, I'll give you 30
seconds to put your helmets on.

727
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,300
Then the oxygen will be
sucked out of this vacuum,

728
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:44,270
and you will know what it's
like to be in space. Go!

729
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,930
<i>Depressurize in 30 seconds.</i>

730
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,350
<i>Main valves have been activated.</i>

731
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,620
Okay, gentlemen, so here's the flight plan.

732
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,560
Now let's keep the laughter to a minimum.
I know this is not to scale.

733
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:19,710
Both shuttles will take
off Tuesday at 6:30 p.m.

734
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:22,300
Now 67 minutes later,

735
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:26,180
you're gonna dock with the Russian space
station to meet cosmonaut Andropov

736
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:29,310
who will refuel the
shuttles with liquid O2.

737
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,970
That's your fuel. Then you'll release...

738
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,860
and take a 60hour trip toward the moon.

739
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:39,150
Now we only have one shot
of landing on this rock,

740
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,660
and that's precisely when the
asteroid passes by the moon.

741
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,660
You'll then use lunar gravity
and burn your thrusters,

742
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:49,160
slingshotting you around the moon,

743
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:51,670
coming up behind the asteroid.

744
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,010
You'll be upward of 11 Gs.
Yeah, I remember this one.

745
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:58,500
It's where the coyote sat his
ass down in a slingshot...

746
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,430
and he strapped himself to an Acme rocket.

747
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,850
- Is-ls that what we're doin' here?
- Rockhound...

748
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,510
No, no, really, because it didn't work
out too well for the coyote, Harry.

749
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,020
Actually, we have a lot better
rockets than the coyote.

750
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,190
Now when you've finished

751
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,020
your Road Runner thrust move,

752
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,940
you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.

753
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,120
Coming around behind the asteroid,

754
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,330
where we're hoping that the tail debris
will be cleared by the moon's gravity.

755
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:28,530
And you'll land right here. That's it.

756
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:31,080
We got separate landing
sites for each team.

757
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,960
Softest parts of the rock as we can figure.

758
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,840
At NASA, we don't take chances.
We double up on everything.

759
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:39,600
First team that hits 800 feet wins.

760
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,720
Now this rock is big, dense. It's got
some gravity. You can walk around,

761
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:46,300
but use your thrusters
so you can work easier.

762
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,560
Okay, Mr. Truman, let's say that
we actually do land on this.

763
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:53,100
What's it gonna be like up there?

764
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,070
Two hundred degrees in the sunlight.
Minus 200 in the shade.

765
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,980
Canyons of razorsharp rock.
Unpredictable gravitational conditions.

766
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,950
Unexpected eruptions. Things like that.

767
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,660
Okay, so the scariest
environment imaginable. Thanks.

768
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:10,250
That's all you gotta say:
scariest environment imaginable.

769
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,410
Okay, so you drill, you drop
the nuke and you leave.

770
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,000
Now here's the key. You're gonna
remote detonate the bomb...

771
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:22,760
before the asteroid passes
this plane, zero barrier.

772
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,640
You do that, and the
remaining pieces of rock...

773
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:29,970
should be deflected enough
to pass right by us.

774
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,600
Now if the bomb explodes
after zero barrier,

775
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:37,520
game's over.

776
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,030
Paul, this is Houston, fire your rockets!

777
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,940
Okay, your rockets are maximum.

778
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:47,160
- Oscar!
- Hey, Harry. Hey, how's it goin'?

779
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:48,118
Have you seen Grace?

780
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,720
Yeah, she's over in the hangar with A.J.

781
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:53,280
Harry, wait a second. Did you say Grace?
Okay, I thought you said Bear.

782
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,920
Will you marry me?

783
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,760
Grace is old enough to vote, Harry.

784
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,850
She's old enough to drink or get married
if she wants to, get a divorce.

785
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,500
Let me tell you something, fellas.

786
00:46:53,501 --> 00:46:55,060
When I get back, when we get this job done,

787
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,060
I will deal with this in my own way.

788
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,391
Come on, Harry. It's not like
I'm rootin' for A.J. here.

789
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,100
I'm just sayin', Grace is
not a little girl any more.

790
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,010
Hey, Rock. You know, wait a minute.

791
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:03,410
Let me get a pencil and a piece of paper.

792
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:05,330
I wanna jot down all your
pearls of wisdom here.

793
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:08,860
Get serious, Harry. Come on. While we're
off trottin' the globe, hunting mud,

794
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,700
Gracie grew up to become a
fullblown hottie, you know?

795
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:14,880
- She's a babe.
- Harry, she is fully hot. She is...

796
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,000
Max, okay, you're talkin' about
my little girl, all right?

797
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:20,580
I think I know who and what she is, okay?

798
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,420
Harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about
a kid who's comin' into her own right now.

799
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:29,100
She's gettin' curious about her body, and
she's exploring her sexuality. You know what?

800
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,380
- Oscar.
- That's a natural thing.

801
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,050
You are about five minutes older than
Grace is. Why should I listen to you?

802
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:37,760
I know what it feels like to have
your hormones pullin' you in just

803
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,770
a thousand different directions.

804
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,940
No disrespect, man, but we
all helped to raise her.

805
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:46,317
So, in part, we all feel like
a bunch of daddies here.

806
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:47,400
That's true.

807
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:52,410
I'll be damned if I worked all these years
so my little girl can marry a roughneck.

808
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,080
She's better than that.

809
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:59,500
Better than all of us.

810
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:10,920
Harry, just sit back, relax. I'm gonna
put on a free Armadillo driving clinic.

811
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,181
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Harry!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

812
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,270
Two shuttle teams.

813
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,400
A.J.'ll be running the drill team with
Oscar, Bear and Noonan on the Independence.

814
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:28,780
I'll run the drill team on Freedom
with Chick, Rockhound and Max.

815
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:31,151
Once we land, we'll have eight
hours to get the job done.

816
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,710
In order to split this rock on the fault
line, we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.

817
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:40,160
Let's get our game faces on. Now
it's time for underwater simulation.

818
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,510
Come on. Let's keep it up. Let's go.
We're the younger team here.

819
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,800
We're on the varsity team.
Take it to 11,000.

820
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:50,800
Okay, gentlemen, we're gonna trick 'em up.
My computer will simulate...

821
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:55,810
a gas pocket at 625 feet and
then hard iron ferrite at 635.

822
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,850
- I'm gonna drill some more.
- We're takin' her up.

823
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,980
- I'm givin' it more torque right now.
- All right, lookin' good, Bear.

824
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:04,150
- Clamp it down. 
- Watch your time, Independence team.

825
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,810
Thanks, Harry. Would you mind
lettin' me run my own team?

826
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,990
- You're gonna blow the tranny. Slow it down, baby.
- Take it easy, Bear.

827
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,490
Just relax. She can handle it.

828
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:16,530
A.J., you're at 600 feet. Your pipe is
long. Let's back the RPMs down to 8,000.

829
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:19,830
- We don't have time for 8,000!
- A.J., take it back down.

830
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,200
You're gonna snap the pipe. I don't
wanna blow this transmission.

831
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,420
- Damn it, 11,000.
- Slow it down, A.J.

832
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,840
Bear, come on. Get on our
team for a little bit.

833
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,930
Oh, space cowboy.

834
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,760
- Harry, are you listenin' to this?
- Yeah, I'm listenin', Bear.

835
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:35,220
You don't work for Harry any more, okay?
Out there, you gotta listen to me.

836
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,890
When we're on that rocket,
you gotta do what I say.

837
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,680
I'm throttling up to another 1,000.

838
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:42,350
A.J., back it off. You're
gonna blow the transmission.

839
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,360
Hey, Harry, would you let
me run my team, please?

840
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:47,970
- RPMs are at red line.
- Bear, goddamn it, I know what I'm doing.

841
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:50,271
Come on. She can handle this.
She'll be fine. Trust me.

842
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,900
- A.J., back down.
- The number one transmission is down.

843
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,950
- Oh, son of a...
- The computer's wrong, and you know that.

844
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,750
- We did the right thing.
- We're gonna restart the simulation.

845
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,050
If you wanna replace a member
of the crew, now is the time.

846
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:07,710
I'll take care of this. Get
him out of the tank, Chick.

847
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,430
- You wanna go home? Is that it? You wanna be fired?
- No, I don't.

848
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,720
- My crew was doing the right thing.
- Your crew?

849
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,930
- Yeah.
- Your crew just blew the transmission, A.J.!

850
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,900
Listen, that NASA computer
is just playin' it safe.

851
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,810
The machine you built the rig could do it.

852
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,070
Shut up. Just shut up! Shut your mouth!

853
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,610
Those men in that room have zero
tolerance for showin' off, hot doggin',

854
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,740
goin' by your gut instinct or you
tryin' to be a hero, you got that?

855
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,660
- Say the words, A.J.!
- I got it!

856
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:39,740
- I want my men to have tomorrow night off.
- What do you mean "off"?

857
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,670
I mean, off. Out of here. For at least
ten hours. Then we'll go to Kennedy.

858
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,670
Well, there's no possible
way we can do that, Harry.

859
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,200
There's a potentially huge security risk.
What if they talk?

860
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,340
- What if they get hurt?
- What if they're too burnt out to do the right thing?

861
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:53,930
What if they get up there, and they
forget what they're fighting for?

862
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,590
You see what's goin' on. These
boys are ready to snap.

863
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,890
They didn't ask to be here.
They got pulled off the street.

864
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,550
For all we know, tomorrow night could
be the last night they ever see Earth.

865
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:03,860
I don't think it's too much to ask to
let 'em spend it with their families.

866
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,440
- Listen, there's no possible way we can do that.
- You got family, Colonel?

867
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:11,030
- Two girls.
- Wouldn't you like to spend tomorrow with your girls?

868
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,110
I'm not askin' ya. I'm tellin' ya.

869
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,620
Make this happen.

870
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:28,460
This is a pretty big loan. Why
don't you count the cash?

871
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,460
Nah, this looks like 100 grand to me.

872
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:33,800
I'm givin' you this at 60 percent.
I hope you know what you're doin',

873
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:36,470
because I'll bust your
head with a sledgehammer.

874
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,180
You'll get your money back.
You don't look too healthy.

875
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:41,140
You're not gonna die on me, are ya?

876
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:45,980
Let's just say, no more than you are.
Thanks, Vic.

877
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,500
- You know what I was thinkin'?
- What?

878
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,210
I really don't think that the animal
cracker qualifies as a cracker.

879
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:14,590
- Why?
- Well, 'cause it's sweet, which to me suggests cookie.

880
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,340
And, you know, putting cheese on something
is sort of the defining characteristic...

881
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,760
of what makes a cracker a cracker.

882
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,770
I don't know why I thought of that. I just.

883
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,440
Baby, you have such sweet pillow talk.

884
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:29,900
I got a little animal cracker, Discovery
Channel thing happenin' right here.

885
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:34,940
Watch the gazelle, as he grazes
through the open plains.

886
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,120
Now look, as the cheetah approaches.

887
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:42,450
Watch, as he stalks his prey.

888
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:45,340
Now, the gazelle's a little spooked,

889
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:50,130
and he could head north to
the ample sustenance...

890
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,050
provided by the mountainous peaks above.

891
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:57,800
He could go south.

892
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:03,400
The gazelle now faces man's
most perilous question:

893
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,930
North...

894
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:10,070
or south?

895
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:14,400
Way down under.

896
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,990
Tune in next week.

897
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,780
Baby,

898
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,920
do you think it's possible that
anyone else in the world...

899
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,910
is doing this very same thing
at this very same moment?

900
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,250
I hope so.

901
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:36,090
Otherwise, what the hell
are we tryin' to save?

902
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,490
Hey.

903
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,620
What are you doing here?

904
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:06,990
I was just passin' by on the, uh...

905
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:09,170
I came...

906
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,720
Who's he?

907
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,550
That man's a salesman.

908
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,800
Would you go inside?

909
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,980
Thank you.

910
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,810
He got big.

911
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:37,060
You can't come around like this.
The court says you can't.

912
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,900
- It confuses him.
- No, I know. I just...

913
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,330
I wanted to say

914
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,170
that I'm sorry...

915
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:49,410
about everything.

916
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:54,170
I got somethin' comin' up.
It's somethin' kinda big.

917
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,170
You just might be proud of me.

918
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,390
Would you do somethin' for me?
Would you just give him this?

919
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,510
You don't have to, you don't have
to tell him who it's from. Just...

920
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,870
Hey, Noonan, you need ten grand?

921
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,250
We gotta put these girls through college.

922
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,210
I love this astronaut stuff.

923
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,300
Good work, if you can get it.

924
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,960
Yeah, I'm just in town doin'
a little astronaut training.

925
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:39,210
Ooh! Astronauta.

926
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,220
Ah, si. I'm a mission specialist.

927
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:44,760
- Yes, and what's that mean?
- I don't know.

928
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,810
Hey! Who the hell do you
think you guys are?

929
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,900
- You're hoggin' all the action.
- Hey, pinhead.

930
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:55,430
Why don't you go find your own party?

931
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:57,110
Why don't you spread the wealth, pal?

932
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,960
Here. Why don't you go buy yourself a neck?

933
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,740
Hey, Mr. Clean!

934
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:08,490
Call NASA! They'll confirm it! We're
astronauts! Get over there. Yeah, yeah.

935
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:11,630
- Yeah, we're astronauts!
- Yeah, we're all astronauts.

936
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:14,127
You are so messing with national
security right now, man.

937
00:56:14,152 --> 00:56:15,784
You are fired tomorrow morning.

938
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:18,300
I'm telling ya. I'll get
the CIA and the FBI.

939
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:20,430
You'll be workin' security at Toys 'R' Us.

940
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,420
- Oh, oh, baby, no, no. No, no!
- Bye-bye, little astronaut.

941
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,430
Oh, don't leave, baby. No, no, no. See, I'm
goin' into space, and I'm not comin' back.

942
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,180
It's coming in at 30,000 miles an hour!

943
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:36,150
Give me a projected impact.
East Asia, 11 minutes.

944
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,690
- We're gonna have to warn...
- Warn who? The entire South Pacific?

945
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,750
So the whole world knows.

946
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,720
Tell me you've never let
anybody down before.

947
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,010
I never quit yet.

948
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,630
- How's that?
- I guess that'll have to do.

949
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:48,060
You know somethin'?

950
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:52,220
I still remember the first,
middle and last name...

951
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:56,100
of every guy that qualified for the
astronaut programme first year I was here.

952
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:01,110
Thanks. I went into the engineering
programme. Kinda had to.

953
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,910
But boy, I wanted to go up there.

954
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:07,530
I wanted to be one of those guys
with a mission patch on my arm.

955
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,020
I tell you, I'd be on that shuttle
with you, Harry, if I could.

956
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:18,880
You don't want to be up in that
shuttle any more than I do.

957
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,330
Good luck in Florida tomorrow.

958
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:27,520
<i>The death of 50,000 people in
Shanghai yesterday has rattled...</i>

959
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,760
<i>A French satellite has
tracked an object in space.</i>

960
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:33,480
<i>Sources are estimating that
the tidal wave was five...</i>

961
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,480
<i>This is CNN, live in Florida.</i>

962
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:38,360
<i>We have just learned that NASA is
on a fullscale military alert.</i>

963
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:41,610
<i>They're calling this a global killer.</i>

964
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,660
<i>The government has been very
tightlipped throughout this.</i>

965
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,110
<i>The Pentagon is getting
involved at this point</i>

966
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,950
<i>with some kind of a project involving
NASA and perhaps a shuttle mission.</i>

967
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:54,200
<i>Senior Pentagon officials refused comment,
adding fuel to the speculation...</i>

968
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,540
<i>that there could be a very serious problem.</i>

969
00:58:56,670 --> 00:59:00,340
<i>We have a special team of astronauts
that arrived in Florida this evening.</i>

970
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:04,800
<i>NASA's in emergency launch preparation
in cooperation with Russian, Japanese...</i>

971
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:09,760
<i>and French space agencies on the most
massive joint space venture in history.</i>

972
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:20,020
Gracie?

973
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,800
Got your note.

974
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:34,780
- What're you doin' out here, honey?
- Um, just thinkin'.

975
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,830
Yeah.

976
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,880
I, um, want to apologize to you for...

977
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:42,210
Oh, no, Grace, stop. You don't
have to apologize at all.

978
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:47,760
I-I sh... I shouldn't have dragged you
around on all those oil rigs.

979
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:50,590
I just

980
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:53,350
I don't think that I did
the right thing with you.

981
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,940
You're wrong. I love my life.

982
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:59,220
I love everything about my life.

983
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,230
And I don't blame you
for my mother leaving.

984
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:06,230
She left us both.

985
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,490
And I love you.

986
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:12,500
And don't talk like you're not comin' back.

987
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:16,500
Promise me that you'll come back.

988
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:20,880
Okay. Say, "I promise."

989
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:24,220
I promise, Grace.

990
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,930
It's gonna be all right, Grace.

991
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,720
If it's not too much trouble,

992
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:40,100
can you please bring my
fiancee home with you?

993
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:41,980
Oh, Jesus.

994
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:55,910
The president will be addressing the nation
and all of you personally within the hour.

995
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:25,400
Astronauts.

996
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:35,860
I'll see you in a couple days, honey.

997
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:39,350
This is who you found to save the planet.

998
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,890
- Frost, you good to go?
- Mmhmm. One One sec.

999
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:44,180
That boy don't take anything seriously.

1000
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:49,070
Yeah. Reminds me of a guy I used to know.

1001
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:54,490
I'm marrying you.

1002
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:59,210
Bet your ass you are.

1003
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:19,390
I address you tonight,

1004
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:23,060
<i>not as the President of the United States,</i>

1005
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,440
<i>not as the leader of a country,</i>

1006
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,240
<i>but as a citizen of humanity.</i>

1007
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:35,910
<i>We are faced with the very
gravest of challenges.</i>

1008
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:42,280
The Bible calls this day
Armageddon, the end of all things.

1009
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:46,670
<i>And yet, for the first time</i>

1010
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,370
<i>in the history of the planet,</i>

1011

<i>a species has the technology</i>

<i>to prevent its own extinction.</i>

01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,260
<i>All of you praying with us need to know</i>

1014
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,770
<i>that everything that can be done
to prevent this disaster</i>

1015
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,770

1016
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:13,450
<i>The human thirst for excellence,</i>

<i>every adventurous reach into space,</i>

<i>all of our combined modern technologies and
imaginations, even the wars that we've fought,</i>

1021
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:34,090
<i>have provided us the tools</i>

1022
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:37,470
<i>to wage this terrible battle.</i>

1023

<i>Through all the chaos that is our history,</i>

1024

is one thing that has</i>

1026
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:52,780
<i>- nourished our souls.</i>
- Mom, that salesman's on TV.

1027
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:55,400
<i>And elevated our species above its origins,</i>

1028
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:57,940
<i>and that is our courage.</i>

1029
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:01,240
<i>Dreams of an entire planet

1030
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:04,040
<i>on those 14 brave souls</i>

<i>travelling into the heavens.</i>

1032
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:09,130
That man's not a salesman.

1033
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,370
- That's your daddy.
<i>- And may we all,</i>

1034
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:15,340
<i>citizens the world over,

1035
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:20,130
<i>Godspeed and good luck to you.</i>

1036
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,020
Freedom crew. Independence crew.

1037
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:38,360
- How ya feelin'?
- Uh, good, you know.

1038
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:42,710
I mean, considering I've never been this
scared in my entire life. I, you know.

1039
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:46,370
Listen. Once you get up there,
you're gonna be on your own.

1040
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:50,510
- If anything should happen...
- I know Harry.

1041
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:53,260
I'll, uh, try not to disappoint you.

1042
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,090
Take care of yourself, kid.

1043

<i>Freedom's on the bridge.
Attention in the firing room.</i>

two hours to the programme goal.</i>

- Hey, Harry.
- Yeah, Rock?

1047
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:31,380
You know, we're sittin' on four million
pounds of fuel, one nuclear weapon...

1048
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:34,470
and a thing that has
270,000 moving parts

1049
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,920
built by the lowest bidder.

1050
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:41,350
- Makes you feel good, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

1051
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:45,850
- How ya doin', Oscar?
- Great.

1052
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:48,350
I got that excited, scared feelin'

1053
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,600
like 98 percent excited, 2 percent scared.

1054
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:55,640
Maybe more. It could be 2... It could be
98 percent scared, 2 percent excited.

1055
01:06:55,780 --> 01:07:01,490
But that's what makes it so intense, is it's
so confused. I can't really figure it out.

1056
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:04,460
Will you make mine really tight,
'cause I don't want to fall out?

1057
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:06,450
I mean, almost to the point
of cutting off circulation.

1058
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:09,330
Ow.

1059
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:12,460
It must be a comfort to know that
if the space programme goes under,

1060
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:14,830
you can always get a job at
Helga's House of Pain, huh?

1061
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:17,420
All right. Flight directors on
with the go/nogo for launch.

1062
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:18,671

- CAPCOM Independence.
- Go flight.

1070
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,530
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's pucker time.

1071
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:36,250
<i>Independence and Freedom, this is Kennedy
firing room. We're T minus one minute.</i>

1072
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:40,740
All crew members, close
and lock your visors.

1073
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:44,450
<i>Independence, this is launch control.
Be advised, we're in a smooth count.</i>

1074
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:47,580
T minus 31. You're go
for autosequence start.

1075
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:50,160
<i>PLTs, perform your APU prestart.</i>

1076
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:55,710
Okay, gentlemen, you're our
warriors up there. God be with you.

1077
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,610
You're already heroes. Just
sit back and enjoy the ride.

1078
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,880
<i>We're T minus 20 seconds.</i>

1079

<i>Four. Three. Two. One.</i>

1081
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:17,660
<i>We have main engine start.</i>

1082
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:20,230
<i>- We have booster ignition.</i>
- We're going.

1083
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:22,990
<i>And liftoff.</i>

1084
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:36,000
<i>Freedom, this is flight deck.</i>

1085
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:37,920
<i>Roger, Freedom. You're looking good.</i>

1086
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:55,810
- We have go for Independence.
<i>- Three. Two. One.</i>

1087
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:58,950
<i>Independence, we have booster ignition.</i>

1088
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:02,740
<i>- We have liftoff.</i>
- We are cooking, Houston.

1089
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:26,760
Houston, the tower is clear.
They're all yours.

1090
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:32,060
Heads up, everybody. They're ours now.

1091
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:35,430
- All engines are go.
- Keep a sharp eye out on both of 'em.

1092
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:45,110
<i>Start roll manoeuvre.</i>

1093
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:57,538
- Two good roll programmes.
- One down.

1094
01:09:57,563 --> 01:09:58,784
Independence, we have a max cue.

1095
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,660
Roger, Control. We are a max cue.

1096
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,970
SRB sep.

1097
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:12,470
- We are single-engine, press, demigo.
<i>- Copy, press, demigo.</i>

1098
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,690
Houston, this is a kickass ride!

1099
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:23,650
<i>Freedom, this is Houston. Main
engine cut out on schedule. Out.</i>

1100
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,040
<i>Freedom, stats are good.</i>

1101
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:43,500
<i>- Independence, telemetry is up and running.</i>
- Oh, my God.

1102
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,380
This is space! 'Course, we're just
in the beginning part of space.

1103
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,010
We-We haven't gotten to outer space yet.

1104
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,500
Roger, Houston. We have a visual on the
Russian space station. Initiating retro burn.

1105
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:59,680
Gentlemen, remember the Russian space
station has been up there for 11 years.

1106
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,150
Most of us don't have cars that old.

1107
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:06,070
Now, the cosmonaut on board has been
on that tin can for 18 months, alone.

1108
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:11,500
So don't be surprised if
he's a little... off.

1109
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:14,330
- Independence, we're gonna put you...
- All right, crew.

1110
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:16,160
Let's exit these flight suits.

1111
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,380
Hello.

1112
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:22,300
This is Russian space station.
Can you hear me?

1113
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:25,510
We copy, Russian space station.
This is Houston.

1114
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,130
I'm ready to fire my thrusters any time.

1115
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:32,680
<i>- Stand by.</i>
- Okay. I'm not going anywhere.

1116
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:35,690
<i>We have a go. Initiate gravitational spin.</i>

1117
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:45,950
<i>You are maxed at 40 percent spin.</i>

1118
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:49,950
Okay, Houston.

1119
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:54,790
I can feel I'm having gravity.

1120
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,750
All right, gentlemen. We're
gonna dock in a minute.

1121
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,750
Now, the Russian space station
has fired her rockets

1122
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,160
- Whee!
- to simulate gravity and let us work faster.

1123
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,420
It's gonna make you queasy,
so prepare yourself.

1124
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:08,920
Well, it's about time. I haven't
thrown up in about an hour.

1125
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:15,260
<i>Initiating first phase
of docking procedure.</i>

1126
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,480
- Switching to manual.
- Manual override.

1127
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:28,780
One foot per second. Let's take this slow
and do it right, folks. Twenty feet.

1128
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:33,150
Ten feet.

1129
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:37,580
Looking good on radar. Five feet.

1130
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:45,290
Locks are engaged. Fuel teams, let's go.

1131
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:48,340
Freedom, telemetry is looking good.

1132
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:50,710
We have soft dock.

1133
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:54,300
Fuel teams, prepare to unload.

1134
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:59,900
All right, gentlemen, watch your heads.

1135
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:01,900
Let's go, Independence.

1136
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:07,360
Colonel.

1137
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:20,660
- Where is he?
- Anybody home?

1138
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,460
Welcome, everybody!

1139
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:30,180
I am not gas station. This is
sophisticated laboratory. I'm in charge.

1140
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:33,390
So do not be touching anything.

1141
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,720
- I need one, I need you.
- Go with him.

1142
01:13:36,850 --> 01:13:38,680
I need you. Hurry up. Hurry up.
Come on. Come on.

1143
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:43,650
It's very important you watch the
fuel gauge, okay? Put on cold suit.

1144
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:46,520
- Countdown clock will hold at...
<i>- Copy that, Houston. Prepping for fuel transfer.</i>

1145
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:49,020
<i>Countdown clock will hold
at T minus 20 minutes and...</i>

1146
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,360
Fuel pod is down there.

1147
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:53,660
It's down here, huh? Great.

1148
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,160
Okay, let's connect these fuel lines.

1149
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:11,380
Freedom on the left,
Independence on the right.

1150
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:13,380
All right. We're goin' left here.

1151
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:20,720
To the right is fuel gauge. You watch
the fuel gauge. One fifty, okay.

1152
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:25,890
One sixty, okay. Two hundred,
bad disaster for space station.

1153
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:31,530
So if you watch 200, you call for Lev,
on, and you see here number one. Off.

1154
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:34,370
You ask for Lev. And you pull
this down, all the way down.

1155
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:39,410
- What's Lev?
- I am Lev Andropov, colonel of Russian space agency.

1156
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:42,750
In Russia I'm a very big man.

1157
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,040
- We're ready to transfer.
- I'm coming. No problem.

1158
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,170
You. You. You there!

1159
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:55,140
- Hard locked.
- Ready for transfusion!

1160
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:05,770
Fuel is pumping.

1161
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:11,940
Hey, Lev, the, uh, thethe
pressure's climbing.

1162
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,070
Still, we're on fuel transference.

1163
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,410
Don't touch my uncle. You know?

1164
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,410
He's a genius of my family.

1165
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:25,380
Lev! Can anybody hear me?
Guys? Hello, guys!

1166
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:28,080
He used to work for a big bomb factory.

1167
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:30,960
He used to make the tip
of the bomb, the thing

1168
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:33,970
that finds, uh, New York
or Washington, you know?

1169
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:38,010
- Ooh.
- Check your hoses. We got some thermal variation.

1170
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:40,630
Stamper, let's look at the
couplings, back on the shuttle.

1171
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:46,560
Okay. Shut down. Uh.

1172
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:54,110
Uh Guys!

1173
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,490
What's that noise?

1174
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:01,280
Oh, no! God!

1175
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,540
What is it?

1176
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:07,830
Leak! Leak!

1177
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,970
Get your men back to the shuttle! Go!

1178
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:17,310
Go! Hurry up! Get out of there!

1179
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:20,760
- You know, this really smarts!
- Pull lever!

1180
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,650
This is the lever!

1181
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:27,520
- Colonel, we must get him out of there!
- A.J., come on out!

1182
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,530
- Aah! Aah!
- Hurry! Hurry!

1183
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,570
Emergency break away!

1184
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:40,570
We got a fire in the fuel pod!

1185
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:47,370
Come on! Come on! Get in here!
A.J.'s stuck in the fuel pod!

1186
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:51,760
We're losing it!

1187
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:05,060
Control, this is Independence.
I am seeing vibration.

1188
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:09,449
Malloy, talk to me!

1189
01:17:09,474 --> 01:17:11,594
Not good. We got sparks
and fire in the fuel pod.

1190
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,730
Independence, blow those locks
and get outta there now!

1191
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:15,730
Dump the hoses now! We're going!

1192
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:18,219
What happened? Let me
shut off the O2 feed!

1193
01:17:18,244 --> 01:17:19,764
Harry, it's burnin' up!

1194
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:22,290
Damn! Max, Rock, get in here!

1195
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:24,570
Get down there and crack
these pipes over here!

1196
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:27,370
- Harry, it's burnin' up!
- We're goin' back for the other team!

1197
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:31,590
Switch on the personnel locators.

1198
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:34,040
Trackin' A.J. He's climbin'.

1199
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:36,590
- No!
- Go! Go!

1200
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:40,430
It's too late! Get back to the shuttle!
This thing's gonna blow!

1201
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,840
No!

1202
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:47,440
Colonel, we gotta move now!
Come on! Close the hatch!

1203
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,930
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
We got a man in there!

1204
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:52,820
Open that door, and we'll all die!
Fuel leak!

1205
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:58,450
Evac now! Let's go! Let's go!

1206
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,110
Come on back! No, wait! The door is broken!

1207
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,910
No! They got the fire
sealed in the fuel pod.

1208
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,160
They locked it down.
Tracking men to the shuttle.

1209
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,290
They've still got two men trapped in there!

1210
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,829
Keep running! The
shuttle's another 75 feet!

1211
01:18:16,854 --> 01:18:18,534
Where's the rest of the team?

1212
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,880
Where's A.J.?

1213
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:23,510
- A.J.'s gone!
- We're not leavin' without A.J.!

1214
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,480
He's gone! It's too late!

1215
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:29,980
Come on! This way is our only chance!

1216
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:32,560
So it's minus hundred!

1217
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,820
Very cold. Hold breath, or lung freezes!

1218
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:44,660
Get back to the shuttle!
And lock that door!

1219
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:54,170
- It's on fire! It's on fire, Harry!
- It's them or all of us!

1220
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:55,346
It's on fire.

1221
01:18:55,571 --> 01:18:56,719
Full thrust.

1222
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,954
We're gonna get hit.

1223
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:18,740
Lev! Lev, the door's gonna blow!

1224
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:20,860
No!

1225
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:27,280
Oh! We're going! It's gonna blow!

1226
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:30,646
- A.J.'s still in there!
- Blow the locks.

1227
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:32,834
- No, the bolts!
- We've gotta...

1228
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,220
I think we're almost there!

1229
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:40,010
Flight, Independence does not have A.J.
They're gonna close the door without him.

1230
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,010
<i>Tracking. They're 75 feet from the shuttle.</i>

1231
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,530
Just tell 'em to air lock the door and go!

1232
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,650
- Dog the hatch now!
- Close it!

1233
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:53,560
Ho!

1234
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:58,310
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Colonel! That thing's
comin' right for We got to move!

1235
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:06,330
Hurry up! There's the shuttle door!

1236
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:09,210
Fire's coming at us! Close the door now!

1237
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:16,420
Go! Go! Go!

1238
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,140
<i>Freedom, the Independence crew
is on board and accounted for.</i>

1239
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:32,270
<i>- We're even heavy one cosmonaut.</i>
- They got 90 percent of their fuel.

1240
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,400
Pretty intense, huh?

1241
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:37,770
That's why I told you, "Touch nothing."

1242
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,940
But you're bunch of cowboys.

1243
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:47,080
<i>So while the consciousness
of the planet is unified,</i>

1244
01:20:47,170 --> 01:20:50,910
<i>focused on the NASA mission taking place
right now in the vast ocean of space,</i>

1245
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,920
<i>we're now in the final
hours of the mission,</i>

1246
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:57,090
<i>as the Freedom and Independence
prepare to slingshot around the moon.</i>

1247
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:09,260
Morning, guys. It's time
to suit up, I guess.

1248
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:11,260
Uh, we got a big day.

1249
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:15,140
Eighteen seconds to radio interrupt.
<i>Booster sequence confirmed.</i>

1250
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:18,320
<i>This is Houston. Roger that, Freedom.
We copy.</i>

1251
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:20,610
Shuttles are ready for the
burn around the moon.

1252
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,940
Radio contact terminated. We're out.

1253
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:28,100
Nine and a half Gs for 11 minutes.
I'd start praying about right now.

1254
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,620
So this is the part where
we're supposed to just

1255
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:38,340
hold on real tight and,
uh, hope we don't die.

1256
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:41,840
- Stand by for lunar roll.
- High inclination. Lunar orbit.

1257
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:46,730
You boys got those wills
filled out correctly?

1258
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:05,700
All right, men, this is what we
trained for. Now just suck it up!

1259
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:08,620
On the mark. Five. Four.

1260
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:11,290
Three. Two. One.

1261
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:24,420
- Is this supposed to be like this?
- Don't worry. This is normal.

1262
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,430
How would you know?

1263
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,930
- Fourteen thousand miles an hour.
- Four Gs.

1264
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:32,180
- Ahh! How long does this last?
- Six Gs.

1265
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:36,244
Fifteen thousand.

1266
01:22:36,269 --> 01:22:38,504
- Really heavy, man!
- This isn't normal.

1267
01:22:38,610 --> 01:22:40,940
- What do you mean, "this isn't normal"?
- This is way worse!

1268
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:43,200
Eight Gs. Hang tight!

1269
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:47,780
- We're not gonna make it!
- Oh, we're gonna die!

1270
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:50,120
Twelve minutes.
<i>Flight, we still got nothin' here.</i>

1271
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:54,030
This is too fast!

1272
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:02,250
Ten Gs!

1273
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:17,440
We're maxed at 22,500!

1274
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:29,330
<i>We have acquisition of signal
from Independence and Freedom.</i>

1275
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:32,820
We're in, guys. All right.
Welcome back, team.

1276
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,250
We have visual of the target, Houston.

1277
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:46,670
You see that?

1278
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:54,980
Wow.

1279
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:56,260
Come in, Independence.

1280
01:23:56,885 --> 01:23:59,184
<i>Houston, you gotta see this to believe it.</i>

1281
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:05,150
Okay, team, let's take 'em in. Okay,
Quincy, how much tail debris do we have?

1282
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,440
<i>Freedom, turn on your FOD radar.</i>

1283
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:10,160
FOD radar on.

1284
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:15,490
Everybody, hang on. This could get a
little rough. Engaging evasive radar.

1285
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:25,010
Hold on!

1286
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:37,880
Goddamn! We got debris!

1287
01:24:39,410 --> 01:24:41,430
We're dumping auxiliary boosters.

1288
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:57,910
Houston, do you read me? We got debris!

1289
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:06,050
We're goin' in! We're comin' in hot!

1290
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:09,460
<i>Independence, try to maintain your
present heading. You've got a target LZ.</i>

1291
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,720
- There's too much debris! We gotta peel off!
- Negative!

1292
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:17,260
We're hit!

1293
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,460
<i>Mayday, mayday!</i>

1294
01:25:21,485 --> 01:25:23,504
I've lost main thrusters. Get 'em back up!

1295
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:25,900
Mayday, Houston, mayday!
<i>We've lost RCS thrusters!</i>

1296
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:30,030
<i>Mayday, Freedom, mayday! We are out
of control! We are going down!</i>

1297
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,440
Do you read me? Freedom, we are going down!

1298
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:47,790
We're gonna hit!

1299
01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:01,400
- Everybody, go to your own life support!
- Lock yourself in the cargo bay!

1300
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,465
We are going down!

1301
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:08,604
<i>Houston! Houston, we are going down!
</i> We have lost control!

1302
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:10,980
I can't get it on!

1303
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:15,780
- Good luck, Freedom.
- Oh, my God, this is it.

1304
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:09,000
Sharp, what the hell is that?
Is that the Independence?

1305
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:18,350
<i>Houston, Independence is a dead stick.
They're not gonna make it.</i>

1306
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:33,820
<i>Houston, Independence has gone down.</i>

1307
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,250
When I touch this baby
down, full reverse thrust.

1308
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:51,420
- Fires on your right, Sharp!
- Reversing the thrusters!

1309
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:55,050
Hang tight! Hang tight!

1310
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:58,720
Houston, we overshot our landing field.
We overshot our landing field.

1311
01:27:58,810 --> 01:28:00,770
Oh, no!

1312
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,370
God! Aah!

1313
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:42,100
Initiate system light system check. Make
sure we can still get off this rock.

1314
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:46,140
Our electrical system is screwed. I'm
going to backup. Fuel seals check.

1315
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:50,270
- Engine seals check. Pressure seals check.
- Oh, God. Oh!

1316
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:57,690
- Anyone hurt?
- Where's...?

1317
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:01,910
Where's the other shuttle? What
happened to the other shuttle?

1318
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,120
- Independence is off the grid.
- "Off the grid"?

1319
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:07,880
What are you, a freakin' cyborg?
What does that mean?

1320
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:10,670
Hey, you saw it yourself, right?

1321
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,710
They're gone.

1322
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:17,640
Come in, Freedom. This is CAPCOM Houston.
Freedom, come in.

1323
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:21,130
This is CAPCOM Houston. Come in, Freedom.

1324
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:24,850
- God!
- Let's just ask God to take care of our friends.

1325
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:32,110
May they rest in peace. Amen.

1326
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:42,580
We got eight hours.

1327
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,870
Let's get this job done and go home.

1328
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,910
Nothin'.

1329
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:50,300
Come on, Watts, Sharp, somebody.

1330
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:53,220
This is CAPCOM Houston.

1331
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:58,220
Come in, Freedom. Freedom, come in.
This is CAPCOM Houston.

1332
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:03,470
Maybe you shouldn't be here. I
don't have anywhere else to go.

1333
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:05,720
Freedom, come in. This is CAPCOM Houston.

1334
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:10,520
All right, let's get the tools
unpacked and fire up the Armadillo.

1335
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:12,898
We're not getting a damn thing
on the inertial nav system.

1336
01:30:12,923 --> 01:30:13,851
I know where we are.

1337
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,620
Please step away. Radio signal's dead.

1338
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,620
I'm flipping the backup generator.

1339
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:21,070
Radio signal's gonna be cut in
half till we get main power back.

1340
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:26,710
We're in segment 202, lateral grid 9,
site 15H32, give or take a few yards.

1341
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:31,590
Captain America here blew the landing by
26 miles. How the hell do you know that?

1342
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:35,420
- Because I'm a genius.
- The gauges will not read.

1343
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:38,130
They're all peaked, like we're
plugged into some magnetic field.

1344
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:40,780
- Well, who on this spaceship wants to know why?
- By all means.

1345
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:43,260
The reason we were shooting
for grid 8 is because...

1346
01:30:43,390 --> 01:30:46,510
thermographics indicated that grid
9 was compressed iron ferrite.

1347
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:50,810
Which means that you landed
us on a goddamn iron plate.

1348
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,740
All right. Well, you heard the man. Let's
wheel out the remote satellite link.

1349
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:57,908
We need that radio.

1350
01:30:57,933 --> 01:31:00,884
Oh, God, please tell me
we still got one of 'em.

1351
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:04,200
<i>Independence has flatlined.</i>

1352
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:48,330
Oh. Oh.

1353
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:51,160
Oscar! Oscar!

1354
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,630
Oh, God!

1355
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:00,970
Hello! Anyone!

1356
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:05,630
Is anyone else alive? Somebody, help me!

1357
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,220
A.J.!

1358
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:13,520
- Where are you?
- I'm here.

1359
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:20,690
Lev, there's no one else.

1360
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:23,740
- There's no one else.
- I know.

1361
01:32:23,870 --> 01:32:26,440
Oh, man.

1362
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:29,580
- Bear, where are you?
- A.J.? A.J.?

1363
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:34,040
I'm in the shuttle, man.

1364
01:32:34,170 --> 01:32:38,090
- Are you all right?
- I'm so glad to see you, man.

1365
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:42,170
I never thought I'd be so
happy to see your ugly face.

1366
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:46,520
- Houston, do you read? <i>This is Freedom.</i>
- Check your thrusters.

1367
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:50,340
<i>- Houston, do you copy?</i>
- Is everyone good to go?

1368
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:02,320
Wow.

1369
01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:15,760
Down here! In the valley!

1370
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:18,590
This place is like Dr.
Seuss's worst nightmare.

1371
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:23,630
Let's get the remote satellite. We'll
get better reception up there.

1372
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:27,010
Bring Max down. Watch
yourself through here, Max.

1373
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:30,430
There're a couple big fissures.
To the left!

1374
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,770
Bring it to the left!

1375
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:40,231
Rockhound, you come on down here and take
some readings down in the flat spot.

1376
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,840
Iron ferrite.

1377
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:52,540
- I have fire.
- Watts, I'm comin' back. Stand by.

1378
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:56,580
<i>- Mostly iron, Rockhound.</i>
- God, I hate knowing everything.

1379
01:33:56,710 --> 01:33:59,670
We couldn't have picked
a worse spot to drill.

1380
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:03,750
Well, I can pretty much guarantee it's
not gonna be thicker than 50 feet.

1381
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:06,760
- How do you figure that?
- 'Cause if it is, we're screwed.

1382
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:11,720
- Max, you good?
- Yeah. Just makin' hole.

1383
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:15,020
- Turn it around.
- Friggin' outer space.

1384
01:34:17,190 --> 01:34:19,270
It's good.

1385
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:29,780
All right. We're in. Another light.
We're cuttin' through pretty good.

1386
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:33,290
There's some stuff in
here I ain't never seen.

1387
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:36,410
All right, let's punch it down!

1388
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:37,818
Hey, Harry, did you see that?

1389
01:34:37,843 --> 01:34:40,024
Yeah, Max, I see it. I see it.
What is it?

1390
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:42,340
- We lost the bite in the bit.
- All right. Back it off. Back it off.

1391
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:44,680
Goddamn it!

1392
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:49,300
Sounds like we twisted a shank. Back it out
of there, Max. Good. Good. Hold her there.

1393
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:56,470
Wow, this is a goddamn Greek tragedy.

1394
01:34:56,570 --> 01:35:00,650
We've all seen broken drill heads before.
Not after ten feet.

1395
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:03,690
I never seen one. Well,
now you've seen one.

1396
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:06,200
- What do you want?
- Unpack the Judge.

1397
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:10,860
Bear, Lev.

1398
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,250
We're only three astronauts left now.

1399
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:18,160
We're not astronauts. We're oil drillers.
We're not even supposed to be here.

1400
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:21,420
What? You're not astronaut?

1401
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:23,790
I'm getting us outta here. Get in.

1402
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:26,340
Why? Just get in the Armadillo.
I have an idea.

1403
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:28,760
Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?

1404
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:31,380
Houston, do you copy? Freedom shuttle has...

1405
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:34,850
We're gettin' some scattered
video feeds here.

1406
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:38,190
<i>Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?</i>

1407
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:40,810
Thank God we have you, Freedom.
Freedom, this is Houston. Go ahead.

1408
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,820
- Don't lose 'em, Malloy.
<i>- Sharp, I'm getting something.</i>

1409
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:46,090
<i>Houston, this is Freedom.
We have landed safely. We are...</i>

1410
01:35:46,115 --> 01:35:46,884
Where are they?

1411
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:49,320
<i>We are at site coordinates
approximately 15H32.</i>

1412
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:51,370
- Okay, I want to know everything we can about that location.
- Got it.

1413
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:54,250
- Get it before we lose 'em.
<i>- We're also having electric and antenna difficulties.</i>

1414
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:57,910
- Walter, get Mechanical on that.
<i>- But we have commenced drilling.</i>

1415
01:35:58,050 --> 01:36:00,720
Stevens, we're losin' him. Bring
it up on four. On four. Come on.

1416
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,710
<i>Shuttle flight capability not yet known.</i>

1417
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,880
- Bump the signal. Bumping. 
- Houston. Houston.

1418
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:08,800
We lost 'em. Get 'em back.
Gruber, we need that hookup.

1419
01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:13,470
Show you how we do things
where I come from.

1420
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:23,940
Hold on!

1421
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:33,950
Seat it.

1422
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:37,250
All right, get ready. Max, thread it.

1423
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:42,040
Guys, the clock is tickin'.
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

1424
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:44,840
All right! Good! Crank it loose!

1425
01:36:44,970 --> 01:36:47,540
Keep it at 25. Let's kick
a little asteroid butt!

1426
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,630
All right, Chick. Give me more
torque on the turbine, huh?

1427
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,520
Max, I need some more power down here!

1428
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,050
- All right, boss.
- Throw it in fourth, then drop the hammer.

1429
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:57,720
- Let's drill through this turd.
- Come on, boys.

1430
01:36:57,810 --> 01:37:02,640
We gotta hop. We're fallin' behind.
Dig, dig, dig. Chew this iron bitch up.

1431
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:09,440
Chick, the tranny's stuck. Harry!

1432
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:12,570
- What is it?
- Chick, come on! Help!

1433
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,790
- Release the clutch!
- Pull it up!

1434
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:17,750
Okay. Well, this thing's not movin'.

1435
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:20,080
No, no, no! Shut it down! Shut it.

1436
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:29,920
This is not workin' out, Harry.

1437
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:34,930
- Oh, are you all right?
- Oh, blew the tranny. Blew the tranny.

1438
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:37,970
Come on, God.

1439
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:41,480
Just a little help. That's all I'm askin'.

1440
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:43,970
I think we're close enough.
He might've heard ya.

1441
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:50,990
Here's the bad news. Before
the asteroid passed the moon,

1442
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:53,370
her rotation was stable at
32 degrees on an x axis.

1443
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:57,990
But now look at this. The lunar
gravity's put her in a spin.

1444
01:37:58,130 --> 01:38:01,460
She's tumbling on all three axes.
This wasn't expected, sir.

1445
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:04,250
- What does this do for communications?
- Not good.

1446
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:07,550
We'll have definite contact with the
shuttle for only seven more minutes.

1447
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:09,521
- After that it's radio darkness.
- For how long?

1448
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:12,840
And after seven minutes, we may
never hear from them again.

1449
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:15,470
But we're trying to bounce a signal...

1450
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:18,080
off a Russian military satellite,
reestablish contact that way.

1451
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:22,480
If we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose
the ability to remote detonate that nuke?

1452
01:38:22,570 --> 01:38:25,140
The weapon remote receives a
signal from a Milstar satellite.

1453
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,150
Higher orbit, more powerful transmitter.

1454
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:31,650
If we've got the shuttle for seven minutes, we
can remote detonate for an additional five.

1455
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:33,740
What he's trying to say, General,
is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time,

1456
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:37,540
you may lose the ability to
detonate the nuke... permanently.

1457
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:39,700
I've got to inform the president.

1458
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:43,750
Just want to make sure you know
we're stuck on an asteroid.

1459
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:45,750
Do you know what you're doing now? No, no.

1460
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:49,050
You know what? I have no idea
what I'm doing. I have no idea.

1461
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:51,380
This button I don't know
what that does, okay?

1462
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:54,050
All I know is that we
just crashed back there,

1463
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:57,050
I lost two of my friends, we're
25 miles from Harry's shuttle.

1464
01:38:57,140 --> 01:39:00,741
We don't know if he's alive. We don't know if
he can fly. All I know is, there's a beep...

1465
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:02,930
on this thing and I'm
trying to get us there.

1466
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:14,240
Let's get it unpacked.

1467
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:15,102
What's up?

1468
01:39:15,127 --> 01:39:18,054
We're drilling through some kind
of metal I've never seen before.

1469
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:21,080
It's fried two of our drill bits, and
now we blew our first transmission.

1470
01:39:21,170 --> 01:39:21,872
So how deep are we?

1471
01:39:22,097 --> 01:39:24,114
We could use your help with
the transmission, Colonel.

1472
01:39:24,170 --> 01:39:27,090
I have an assessment report due now.
We're supposed to be at 200 feet.

1473
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:30,210
- So how deep are we?
- Not as deep as we'll be

1474
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:32,920
when you quit askin' me these questions
and help us load this transmission on.

1475
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:36,510
- What is our current depth?
- Our current depth is not important, Colonel.

1476
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:39,220
I'll decide what's important.
We've got 800 feet to drill.

1477
01:39:39,310 --> 01:39:42,270
You've had two and a half hours.
Where are we?

1478
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:46,110
We're at 57 feet.

1479
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:50,100
Now, if you're not too busy, maybe you can
give us a hand with this transmission.

1480
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:55,450
Colonel Sharp! Get this strapped up.
I'll be right back. Colonel Sharp!

1481
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:58,570
All right. I'm coming through.
We have contact. Over.

1482
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:01,580
That's as clear as it's gonna get.

1483
01:40:01,670 --> 01:40:03,960
Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?

1484
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:08,260
<i>Working at a remote satellite link
at this moment. Transmission change.</i>

1485
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:10,960
- Colonel!
- Twenty minutes. Puts drilling final at ten hours.

1486
01:40:11,090 --> 01:40:14,790
Please advise. That's four hours past
the zero barrier. Please advise.

1487
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:17,850
What the hell is this? "Zero depth"?

1488
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:20,661
And where'd this come from? Who are
you talkin' to? Is that Truman?

1489
01:40:20,690 --> 01:40:25,100
Lemme have that phone. Gimme the phone. Truman!
Look, this is what happens when you drill.

1490
01:40:25,190 --> 01:40:29,240
We cannot use your "U.S. Air Force
Personnel Only" drill time card.

1491
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,980
Who wrote this thing, by the way?
We're losing come again.

1492
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:34,020
Look Is he getting this? Does he
hear me or What's wrong with this?

1493
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:36,830
- The com's down.
- What do you mean, "the com's down"?

1494
01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:39,200
What do I mean? I mean we've lost
communication to mission control.

1495
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:42,000
Fine. Let's go back to the cargo
bay and get the transmission

1496
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,790
Harry, guess what. You had your shot.
You didn't do it. You understand me?

1497
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:49,460
You can't. Why don't you stay here?

1498
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:53,500
Write a report, why don't ya? That'll be.

1499
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:55,630
My men and I will go and get this hole dug!

1500
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:59,510
You and your men are the biggest
mistake in the history of NASA.

1501
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,440
- We've lost communication.
- Oh, God.

1502
01:41:07,230 --> 01:41:12,030
- We're not lookin' too good right now.
- No shit.

1503
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:14,690
We gotta get that radio back up.

1504
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:19,700
Mr. President, it's time
to make a decision.

1505
01:41:19,790 --> 01:41:24,530
We can remote detonate the bomb
for only another five minutes.

1506
01:41:24,630 --> 01:41:30,300
Yes? Kimsey here. Yes, Mr. President.

1507
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:32,330
Yes, we saw that too, sir.

1508
01:41:32,430 --> 01:41:35,300
But maybe we should wait until they...

1509
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:45,390
Dan, get them out of there.

1510
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:48,390
- Evac right now.
- What's goin' on here?

1511
01:41:48,530 --> 01:41:50,650
I've been ordered to override the system.

1512
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:57,770
Well, what is this?

1513
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,620
Secondary protocol.

1514
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,960
But they haven't drilled the damn hole yet!

1515
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:19,050
The president's advisors feel
that the drilling isn't working.

1516
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:20,941
And we've lost radio
contact, maybe for good.

1517
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:24,020
We've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed
ability to remote detonate that nuke.

1518
01:42:24,150 --> 01:42:27,070
If we don't do it now we could lose
control, and we may never get it back.

1519
01:42:27,110 --> 01:42:29,990
Well, you tell the president that he
better fire his so-called advisors.

1520
01:42:30,110 --> 01:42:33,440
If you detonate that nuke on the
surface, we waste a perfectly good bomb,

1521
01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:35,610
and we have one chance to save this planet!

1522
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:51,880
- I need that radio. Gruber, give me everything you got now!
- Roger that.

1523
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:59,080
Yes, Mr. President, I understand that
completely, but my point is very, very simple.

1524
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:01,590
And I think you need to trust me on
this because I know something about it.

1525
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:04,770
I guarantee you, if you
do this, you kill us all.

1526
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,810
Yes, sir.

1527
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:13,140
General, he wants you.

1528
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:18,320
This is Kimsey. Yes, sir.

1529
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:20,860
I understand.

1530
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,870
The orders are to remote
detonate in 30 seconds.

1531
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,500
You have not told them yet!

1532
01:43:29,630 --> 01:43:32,120
That is my father up there!

1533
01:43:32,210 --> 01:43:35,550
This is one order you shouldn't
follow, and you fucking know it!

1534
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:38,350
Let her go. Let her go!

1535
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:41,590
Your key, sir.

1536
01:43:44,270 --> 01:43:48,140
God be with them.

1537
01:43:48,230 --> 01:43:51,020
Slow it down.

1538
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:00,020
Harry...

1539
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:03,690
the clock on that ninefoot
nuclear weapon is ticking.

1540
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:08,500
Oh, my God! Sharp! Get back here now!

1541
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,130
What? Get the shuttle ready to evac now!

1542
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,110
It just came on all by itself.
What the hell's happening?

1543
01:44:14,135 --> 01:44:14,904
Secondary protocol.

1544
01:44:14,970 --> 01:44:16,870
- What's that? What?
- Secondary protocol.

1545
01:44:17,010 --> 01:44:18,750
- What does that mean?
- What the hell's secondary protocol?

1546
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:20,710
- They're detonating this thing from Earth.
- What do you mean, detonating?

1547
01:44:20,850 --> 01:44:22,590
- We haven't even drilled the hole yet!
- We'll drop it in the hole.

1548
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:24,002
What're you talkin' about?
The hole? Whoa, whoa!

1549
01:44:24,027 --> 01:44:24,784
Get your helmets on now!

1550
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:27,890
- Oh, no, no. How-How you turn it off?
- I got two men out on that rock!

1551
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:30,270
I got a man out there too.
We gotta evac now.

1552
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:32,270
Max, Rockhound, get back to
the shuttle, doubletime!

1553
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:35,270
- They could be on their way here.
- They're not on their way here.

1554
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:38,110
They would've talked to us by now.
We would've seen them.

1555
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:41,360
- Watts, air lock the cockpit now!
- I copy you.

1556
01:44:41,450 --> 01:44:42,135
Max, Rockhound!

1557
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:44,764
Hey, wait a minute! How
do you turn this thing off?

1558
01:44:44,830 --> 01:44:48,250
- Harry, do you copy?
- Something's wrong.

1559
01:44:48,330 --> 01:44:51,040
Yeah, it's all wrong, man. We
shouldn't even be up here.

1560
01:44:51,130 --> 01:44:53,120
I know. Let's go back to the ship!

1561
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:55,880
I'm not leavin' without my men, Sharp.

1562
01:44:55,970 --> 01:44:59,130
We've got two and a half minutes
to drop it and get off this rock.

1563
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:01,550
If they're not back by the time
we finish, we leave without 'em.

1564
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:04,050
Okay, let's simplify this. Let's
just turn the bomb off right now.

1565
01:45:04,140 --> 01:45:06,930
If we don't put this bomb down in a
hole 800 feet onto a fault line,

1566
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:09,341
all you're gonna have is a
real expensive fireworks show.

1567
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:11,890
This is turnin' into a
surrealistic nightmare here.

1568
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:14,390
Watsler, are you listening? It's Truman.

1569
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:18,430
Okay, listen to me carefully. I want
you to kill it. Kill the uplink.

1570
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,514
Give us the time, Sharp.
Shut this bomb down now!

1571
01:45:32,539 --> 01:45:33,644
It's not my call.

1572
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:34,426
Then whose call is it?

1573
01:45:34,451 --> 01:45:36,404
An order to detonate can
only come from the president.

1574
01:45:36,510 --> 01:45:38,330
- The president's not here! You've gotta give us more time!
- Let's just turn it off now.

1575
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:40,460
I'm telling you to shut this bomb down now!

1576
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:42,460
And I'm telling you it's not my call!
Well, guess what.

1577
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:45,380
I just made the call for you. Harry!

1578
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:50,470
Don't. You could set it off.

1579
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:54,270
Oh, man. What're you doin'
with a gun in space?

1580
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:02,110
Come on. Come on. We gotta stop that
bomb right now. Kill the uplink.

1581
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:07,490
This thing is gonna blow. We
gotta get it off the ship. Easy.

1582
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:12,950
Stand down, Sergeant. Shut this bomb down
and let us finish our job the right way.

1583
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:15,170
I'm under orders to protect
a surface detonation.

1584
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:19,420
I'm gonna give you three seconds to shut this
bomb down, and then I'm gonna make you shoot me.

1585
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:23,050
Hurry, Watsler. For Christ's sake, hurry.

1586
01:46:25,390 --> 01:46:27,960
What happened?

1587
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:33,100
Aah!

1588
01:46:33,230 --> 01:46:37,520
Sir, the override. It's been overridden.

1589
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:41,150
I bought us a couple of minutes, so get
that radio workin', okay? Hurry, hurry!

1590
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:47,410
Bring me all the way up here just to
blow me and my friends up? Is that it?

1591
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:49,660
- Listen...
- Shut up!

1592
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:54,160
Shut up, Colonel. I'm talking now.

1593
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:57,370
It could start again. It
might've been a warning.

1594
01:46:57,460 --> 01:46:59,370
Uhoh.

1595
01:46:59,470 --> 01:47:01,870
That's why you are gonna
dismantle this bomb.

1596
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:04,930
All right. What'd we miss?

1597
01:47:08,770 --> 01:47:11,600
- Do it again.
- Go.

1598
01:47:14,110 --> 01:47:16,010
Keep tryin'.

1599
01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:23,440
Sir, I need you to cease and desist.
I need your terminal... now.

1600
01:47:26,330 --> 01:47:29,610
They're reactivating the bomb.
Comin' back online, sir.

1601
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:32,620
Oh, geez. Here we go again.

1602
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:35,950
What're you doin' up here? And why did
you even bother to make the trip?

1603
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:39,000
To do the right thing,
to see that it's done.

1604
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:48,550
For God's sakes, think
about what you're doin'.

1605
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:52,770
Why are you listenin' to someone
that's 100,000 miles away?

1606
01:47:52,850 --> 01:47:56,930
We're here. Nobody down there can help us.

1607
01:47:57,020 --> 01:48:00,690
So if we don't get this job
done, then everybody's gone.

1608
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:03,110
One minute.

1609
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:06,030
I've been drillin' holes
in the earth for 30 years.

1610
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:10,820
And I have never, never missed
a depth that I have aimed for.

1611
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:14,290
And by God, I am not gonna miss this one.
I will make 800 feet.

1612
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:19,960
42 seconds. But I can't do it
alone, Colonel. I need your help.

1613
01:48:20,050 --> 01:48:24,130
You swear on your daughter's
life, on my family's,

1614
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:26,130
that you can hit that mark?

1615
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:31,210
I will make 800 feet. I
swear to God, I will.

1616
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:34,300
Then let's turn this bomb off.

1617
01:48:45,610 --> 01:48:49,360
Steady. Take it back. That's what you'll
have to do. Get 'em off backwards.

1618
01:48:49,490 --> 01:48:52,910
Rainbow track? Under under one? Under Okay.
All of 'em. All of 'em.

1619
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:56,450
- Okay. Are we free of static?
- Oh, do a good job. Do a good job.

1620
01:48:56,540 --> 01:48:58,500
Steady. Steady. Good job.
All right. All right.

1621
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:01,960
Go! Go! Go! Red wire "A." Ready? And.

1622
01:49:02,050 --> 01:49:04,500
Now. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

1623
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:06,790
Negative "B."

1624
01:49:06,890 --> 01:49:09,890
- Ready, and now.
- Do a good job. Do a good job.

1625
01:49:09,915 --> 01:49:11,574
Track flipped. Hots in.

1626
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:14,140
- It better be. Go.
- Red or blue?

1627
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:17,890
Re...

1628
01:49:21,940 --> 01:49:23,850
Blue.

1629
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:28,190
Good job!

1630
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:36,210
Oh, God, it sucks up here.

1631
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:39,950
Sir, the clock has stopped
at three seconds. What?

1632
01:49:41,130 --> 01:49:43,250
Have we lost complete radio contact?

1633
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:46,090
I got some magic happening. We're bouncing
off Russian and French satellites.

1634
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:49,790
- It may have a faint signal.
<i>- Houston? Houston, do you copy?</i>

1635
01:49:51,350 --> 01:49:53,670
<i>Go ahead, Freedom.</i>

1636
01:49:53,810 --> 01:49:56,890
<i>Houston, you have a problem. Problem.</i>

1637
01:49:56,980 --> 01:49:59,600
See, I promised my little
girl that I'd be comin' home.

1638
01:49:59,730 --> 01:50:05,570
Now, I don't know what you people are doin'
down there, but we got a hole to dig up here.

1639
01:50:05,650 --> 01:50:09,020
Go, go, go, go! Come on. We got work to do.

1640
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:12,940
Okay, guys. All go, no quit.
How ya doin' down there? Good?

1641
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:15,950
Okay, got the tranny.
We're back in business.

1642
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:19,460
Hey, you guys should take a
break and come up and see this.

1643
01:50:21,170 --> 01:50:23,960
Wow. Got a great view
of the Earth from here.

1644
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:26,290
Too bad we'll never set foot on her again.

1645
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:28,590
- Lev, do you see anything?
- No.

1646
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:30,630
Well, keep goin'. I'm not givin' up.

1647
01:50:31,850 --> 01:50:33,970
Hold up here, Bear.

1648
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:36,220
- Oh, boy.
- This is great.

1649
01:50:36,350 --> 01:50:39,220
We just happen to run into the
Grand Canyon on the asteroid?

1650
01:50:39,350 --> 01:50:42,600
I told you, you took a
wrong way, a wrong road.

1651
01:50:42,690 --> 01:50:45,940
What... What road? Do you
see any roads around here?

1652
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:50,110
You know what? I do not have much
pleasure being near God's ear.

1653
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:52,770
But you think this is
looking good, or what?

1654
01:50:52,870 --> 01:50:57,330
Lev, why don't you just do humanity
a favour and just shut the hell up?

1655
01:51:01,790 --> 01:51:04,170
Have you ever heard of Evel Knievel?

1656
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:06,620
No, I never saw Star Wars.

1657
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:15,340
All right. Doin' a good job.

1658
01:51:15,470 --> 01:51:17,880
- Give me a depth reading, Max.
- We're 150 feet, Harry.

1659
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:23,180
Yeeha!

1660
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:27,020
Ride 'em, cowboy! Yippeekaiyo, kaiyay!

1661
01:51:27,110 --> 01:51:31,320
Get off... the nuclear... warhead.

1662
01:51:31,410 --> 01:51:33,400
I was doin' that guy from
that movie, you know,

1663
01:51:33,530 --> 01:51:36,620
Slim Pickens, where he rides it all
the way in the nuclear warhead.

1664
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:39,530
- Now.
- Oh, you didn't see that one, huh?

1665
01:51:39,670 --> 01:51:42,540
We got 700 feet of hole to dig, Rockhound.

1666
01:51:42,630 --> 01:51:45,630
All right. Just-Just wanted to feel
the power between my legs, brother.

1667
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:50,210
Hey, Sharp.

1668
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:53,500
No nukes! No nukes! No nukes!

1669
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,590
You got any more bullets
in that gun, Sharp?

1670
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:58,560
What did Watts tell you, Bear? If she kicked
you in the balls, you'd keep floating.

1671
01:51:58,690 --> 01:52:01,600
Yeah.

1672
01:52:01,730 --> 01:52:03,600
We turn the thrusters off,

1673
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:06,100
we jump this thing, we float right over it.

1674
01:52:06,230 --> 01:52:08,310
Go over it again, Lev.

1675
01:52:08,450 --> 01:52:13,240
- Throw the jet thrusters off exactly when we jump.
- Okay.

1676
01:52:13,370 --> 01:52:16,240
And then we're gonna put them on,
and we gonna go down nice and slow.

1677
01:52:16,370 --> 01:52:19,370
That's it. That's it, baby. That's it.
Is this gonna work?

1678
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:23,500
- I don't know.
- Lev, you know what, just lie to me.

1679
01:52:23,630 --> 01:52:26,750
Let's say 50/50 No. More like, uh

1680
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,920
like 70/30 or 80/20.

1681
01:52:30,050 --> 01:52:35,040
But you know what? If it works, the two
of you gonna be heroes, just like me.

1682
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:38,590
Screw it. We're jumpin' over this canyon.

1683
01:52:41,770 --> 01:52:46,020
Just for the record,
this is a very bad idea!

1684
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:51,400
- Wait for the edge. Don't hit it till we get there.
- I'm waiting.

1685
01:52:53,490 --> 01:52:56,410
Three.

1686
01:52:56,490 --> 01:52:58,950
Two. One!

1687
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:01,110
Aah!

1688
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:11,800
Yes! It's working! It's working!

1689
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:15,340
Oh, my God!

1690
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:20,180
- I'm a genius! Wait a minute.
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1691
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:22,550
We got some rocks! Go left! Go left!

1692
01:53:22,690 --> 01:53:25,310
Lev, Lev, I can't do anything!

1693
01:53:34,530 --> 01:53:37,490
Oh, okay, okay, we're
floating into outer space.

1694
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:40,180
Check main switch. Uh, this could
be a little bit of a problem.

1695
01:53:41,290 --> 01:53:43,410
Thrusters on... now! All
right, turn 'em on.

1696
01:53:43,540 --> 01:53:47,240
What's wrong?

1697
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:51,840
II don't know. The-The thrusters
not working. I hate this machine!

1698
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:54,330
I thought you had this planned! What're we
supposed to do? Be quiet! I must think!

1699
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:57,510
- I'm stepping outside.
- You're... You're going outside?

1700
01:53:57,640 --> 01:54:03,180
I am the only certified astronaut,
and I'm saving your American ass!

1701
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:09,360
Yes. You'll listen to him. Right.

1702
01:54:14,570 --> 01:54:18,360
Hurry up, Lev, because we're
about a mile off the asteroid!

1703
01:54:18,450 --> 01:54:21,740
Just a second. The fuel line is iced up.

1704
01:54:21,870 --> 01:54:26,200
- I think maybe workin' now.
- No, Lev, it's not working!

1705
01:54:26,290 --> 01:54:29,130
I'm sorry, A.J. I was way off the odds.

1706
01:54:29,250 --> 01:54:31,790
- We're gettin' higher, man.
- Look out!

1707
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,830
The rocks! Rocks are coming!

1708
01:54:40,770 --> 01:54:45,010
- Hold on!
- Aah!

1709
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:49,060
- Pull the thrusters!
- Lev, look out!

1710
01:54:55,950 --> 01:54:58,900
- We lost Lev.
- A.J.!

1711
01:54:59,030 --> 01:55:02,490
- A.J., the thrusters!
- Aah!

1712
01:55:05,540 --> 01:55:07,660
Let's get Lev back!

1713
01:55:07,790 --> 01:55:12,340
Aah!

1714
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:18,580
Lev, hold on! We're comin' in!

1715
01:55:35,150 --> 01:55:36,980
Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, Lord.

1716
01:55:37,110 --> 01:55:39,271
Thank You. Thank You, thank
You, thank You, thank You.

1717
01:55:39,330 --> 01:55:42,240
Lev!

1718
01:55:42,330 --> 01:55:47,780
- Now I'm really a Russian hero!
- I told you!

1719
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:50,370
- I know!
- I knew this would work!

1720
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,830
- Good odds, you know?
- Come on, Lev.

1721
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:55,670
- Get in here. We gotta go.
- Yah!

1722
01:55:59,010 --> 01:56:01,300
Rockhound, keep on that transmission.

1723
01:56:01,430 --> 01:56:03,750
- Tranny looks good, Harry.
- All right. Take it outta there.

1724
01:56:03,850 --> 01:56:05,760
Lock it down, Chick.

1725
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:11,060
Nice.

1726
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:13,810
How come we didn't get any
training on this thing?

1727
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:17,610
Whoa. Very cool. I could take out
this asteroid singlehandedly.

1728
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:21,150
Okay, boys, give it a rest.
I'll take it from here.

1729
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:24,040
Whoa!

1730
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:26,620
- What the hell is that?
- It's Rockhound. Whoa.

1731
01:56:26,710 --> 01:56:28,830
This is so much fun, it's freaky.

1732
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:32,960
Rockhound!

1733
01:56:33,050 --> 01:56:35,170
Whoa, watch your heads. Sorry, Harry.

1734
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:40,510
- Outta my way, boys!
- Rockhound!

1735
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:44,390
Meet your maker, asteroid!

1736
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:50,940
- What the hell's the matter with you, Rockhound? Goddamn!
- This is insane.

1737
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:52,914
- Have you lost your mind?
- No.

1738
01:56:52,939 --> 01:56:54,924
He's got space dementia.

1739
01:56:55,030 --> 01:56:57,190
Harry, you want to watch your man.

1740
01:56:59,740 --> 01:57:04,900
Max, downshift and put it in reverse.
We gotta get that pipe outta there.

1741
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,160
Uhoh.

1742
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:10,597
What's happening?

1743
01:57:10,622 --> 01:57:13,114
- The ground's cracking!
- Earthquake!

1744
01:57:20,930 --> 01:57:24,260
Quick, shut it off!

1745
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:27,720
- Shut it off! Shut it off now!
- We're gonna have a blowout!

1746
01:57:27,850 --> 01:57:30,260
- We hit a gas pocket!
- We got pressure out the ass!

1747
01:57:32,610 --> 01:57:36,440
Max, get your helmet on!
Max, she's gonna blow!

1748
01:57:36,570 --> 01:57:39,650
- Aah! Oh, Jesus, I'm cooking!
- Max, get outta there!

1749
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:43,910
- This is it!
- Harry!

1750
01:57:46,250 --> 01:57:48,240
I'm bailing!

1751
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:52,910
Max!

1752
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:57,000
Goodbye, Max.

1753
01:57:57,130 --> 01:58:00,420
- Max!
- Take care, buddy.

1754
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:02,777
- Armadillo's off the scope.
- I think we've had a blowout.

1755
01:58:02,802 --> 01:58:04,294
No sign of the Armadillo.

1756
01:58:35,630 --> 01:58:38,880
Get ahold of Truman.

1757
01:58:39,010 --> 01:58:41,300
Prepare the world for bad news.

1758
01:58:48,270 --> 01:58:51,020
<i>We're getting sketchy
information that the mission</i>

1759
01:58:51,140 --> 01:58:53,720
<i>has suffered massive failure.</i>

1760
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:55,730
<i>And what we're trying to do right now</i>

1761
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:57,900
<i>is to confirm that and find
out exactly what that means.</i>

1762
01:58:58,030 --> 01:59:00,940
<i>Repeat: We're getting leaks
from several NASA officials,</i>

1763
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:03,490
<i>some rushing home to be
with their families,</i>

1764
01:59:03,570 --> 01:59:06,150
<i>that the drilling was unsuccessful.</i>

1765
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:18,210
<i>This could very well be our final hour.</i>

1766
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:24,050
<i>We're gonna go off the air now.</i>

1767
01:59:24,180 --> 01:59:27,050
<i>Good luck and God bless.</i>

1768
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:32,430
<i>- We've got incoming.
- I got tracks.</i>

1769
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:34,640
NORAD's tracking four small
incoming over Europe.

1770
01:59:34,730 --> 01:59:36,640
I think one's about to hit near Paris.

1771
02:00:00,510 --> 02:00:04,370
Reports are coming in.

1772
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:07,350
<i>Martial law has been
implemented in 42 countries.</i>

1773
02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:09,670
<i>Once the asteroid hits zero barrier,</i>

1774
02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:14,100
<i>it will take about three hours
and 57 minutes to impact Earth.</i>

1775
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:19,770
I guess we do it the president's way.

1776
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:22,060
I'll order an evac. You
can remote detonate.

1777
02:00:22,190 --> 02:00:25,360
- You still don't think this'll work, do you?
- What I think is irrelevant.

1778
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:28,400
- We need to do it now.
- Fine.

1779
02:00:28,490 --> 02:00:30,570
- Can they still take off?
- We hope so.

1780
02:00:30,700 --> 02:00:32,740
You are the one that pulled them into this!

1781
02:00:32,870 --> 02:00:36,790
That is my family up there, so I
don't wanna hear, "We hope so"!

1782
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:45,130
Guess what, guys? It's time
to embrace the horror.

1783
02:00:45,260 --> 02:00:48,710
Look. We got frontrow tickets
to the end of the Earth.

1784
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:15,530
- Yeah!
- Way to go, baby! Harry!

1785
02:01:22,090 --> 02:01:24,920
Yo, Harry! What's up, baby?

1786
02:01:25,010 --> 02:01:27,960
Hey, get that bomb outta there!
We got a hole to make!

1787
02:01:28,050 --> 02:01:31,550
Houston, you're not gonna believe this,

1788
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:34,260
but the other Armadillo has arrived.

1789
02:01:34,350 --> 02:01:37,720
All right, people, listen up.
Settle down and focus.

1790
02:01:37,850 --> 02:01:41,310
- Mechanical, get online. PPO, gimme a setup.
- Your boyfriend's back.

1791
02:01:42,820 --> 02:01:45,270
Yo, Harry!

1792
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:48,480
Hey, Harry. You miss me?

1793
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:52,150
A.J., I got just five words for ya.

1794
02:01:52,290 --> 02:01:55,570
Damn glad to see ya, boy! That's six words.

1795
02:01:55,710 --> 02:01:58,710
- Chick, walk 'em down.
- So where's this hole you need dug?

1796
02:01:58,830 --> 02:02:01,590
Houston, drilling has recommenced.

1797
02:02:01,710 --> 02:02:05,160
Do you think they can drill
250 feet in an hour?

1798
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:07,290
They better.

1799
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:10,010
Bring that piece on in, Bear.

1800
02:02:10,140 --> 02:02:12,810
Tractor pull.

1801
02:02:12,890 --> 02:02:16,180
- I'm comin' down!
- We got 250 feet to go.

1802
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:19,350
It's our last transmission,
last drill head.

1803
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:23,480
Punch it through. First gear.
We got contact.

1804
02:02:23,570 --> 02:02:28,530
- Come on down, A.J. I got this, man.
- Let's go!

1805
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:32,530
Lev, the right engine hub. Houston, I'm getting
no response from the preflight sequence.

1806
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:36,200
Come on, now. This is
not Hey Hey, come here.

1807
02:02:36,330 --> 02:02:40,380
Can you get me outta here, please, Lev?
Thank you.

1808
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:43,710
Ow! Jesus! Hey! Wait. Uh, shh, shh.

1809
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:46,200
Lev, the right engine Okay.

1810
02:02:46,340 --> 02:02:49,290
Lemme outta here, will ya? Just
tryin' to have some fun before I die!

1811
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:53,010
- How deep are we?
- 770 deep.

1812
02:02:58,350 --> 02:03:00,430
- Whoa, they got problems.
- The gauges are spiking.

1813
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:02,600
Methane! Shut it down! Back it down!

1814
02:03:02,730 --> 02:03:06,730
I can't pull back now. The bit'll get
lodged. We don't have enough time!

1815
02:03:06,860 --> 02:03:10,610
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's gonna blow!
- It's how we lost Max!

1816
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:14,520
I know what I'm talkin' about. We can punch
through this. We can knock this outta the park.

1817
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:16,410
This is our last transmission, A.J.

1818
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:18,660
Goddamn it, if you're ever
gonna trust me, ever,

1819
02:03:18,790 --> 02:03:21,580
once in your life, trust me now!

1820
02:03:21,670 --> 02:03:22,870
Harry, it's gonna blow!

1821
02:03:22,895 --> 02:03:26,024
Harry, I know what I'm doin'.
You just gotta trust me.

1822
02:03:27,420 --> 02:03:29,300
Make the call.

1823
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:33,680
All right. Hold on. I'm
pushin' through her.

1824
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,470
I'm pushin' through her!

1825
02:03:42,610 --> 02:03:46,140
What's your depth? 775. 780.

1826
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:48,980
Take it up, baby! Ram it home!

1827
02:03:49,110 --> 02:03:51,150
Drive on down, A.J.!

1828
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:53,900
785. Come on. Come on.

1829
02:03:53,990 --> 02:03:55,687
- Come on, A.J.!
- Punch it!

1830
02:03:55,712 --> 02:03:57,054
791. Come on.

1831
02:03:57,160 --> 02:04:00,280
792. 795!

1832
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:02,990
Drive it down, A.J.!

1833
02:04:03,130 --> 02:04:05,620
797! 99!

1834
02:04:05,710 --> 02:04:08,960
Breakthrough! 800! 802, Harry!

1835
02:04:09,090 --> 02:04:11,000
- Yeah!
- We did it!

1836
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:14,470
Yes! We did it!

1837
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:18,680
- Yeah! Kid, way to go!
- I knew it, baby!

1838
02:04:18,810 --> 02:04:21,105
It's not over till we get
the bomb down that hole.

1839
02:04:21,130 --> 02:04:22,704
Watts, they've got 38 minutes.

1840
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:44,920
Harry, you've gotta give me that hole.

1841
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:48,660
I'm gonna need two more minutes. I
got a bent pipe jammed in the hole.

1842
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:51,470
We gotta cut it out before we
can send that bomb down. A.J.!

1843
02:04:51,550 --> 02:04:53,960
- She good to go?
- Yeah, I'm all set.

1844
02:04:54,050 --> 02:04:56,460
All right.

1845
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:03,640
All right. A.J., come on! Make it fast!

1846
02:05:03,730 --> 02:05:07,020
I'm goin' as fast as I can!
There's a lot of gas pressure!

1847
02:05:12,530 --> 02:05:14,400
You feel that?

1848
02:05:14,530 --> 02:05:17,320
Harry, you gotta give me that hole.
The bomb is almost ready.

1849
02:05:17,410 --> 02:05:19,870
Pull that pipe out! Harry,
I'm almost through!

1850
02:05:19,950 --> 02:05:21,530
Give me 15 more seconds!

1851
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:29,510
Well, this is somethin' new.

1852
02:05:29,590 --> 02:05:32,630
I don't think this thing likes us.

1853
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:36,540
That's 'cause it knows we're
here to kill it. Whoa!

1854
02:05:41,020 --> 02:05:43,560
Hey, what's goin' on up there?

1855
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:51,430
A.J.! What the hell was that?

1856
02:05:51,570 --> 02:05:54,610
- A.J.!
- Goddamn it, I'm finished!

1857
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:58,900
- A.J., you all right?
- Oh, lot of gas pressure in here, man!

1858
02:05:58,990 --> 02:06:01,780
Get me out! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hydrogen pocket!

1859
02:06:01,910 --> 02:06:04,450
Aah!

1860
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:12,790
Whoa!

1861
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:18,590
Aah!

1862
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:22,350
Oh! Harry! Pull me in!

1863
02:06:23,770 --> 02:06:28,150
Aah! A.J., hang on!

1864
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:36,530
Secure the bomb!

1865
02:06:36,660 --> 02:06:39,410
Sharp, heads up!

1866
02:06:39,490 --> 02:06:42,610
Gruber! Get outta there now!

1867
02:06:42,710 --> 02:06:44,950
Oh, no.

1868
02:06:51,590 --> 02:06:54,960
Oh, God, no!

1869
02:07:00,350 --> 02:07:02,920
Look out!

1870
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:08,980
Help! Oh, no!

1871
02:07:16,410 --> 02:07:19,320
Do you believe that just happened?

1872
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:24,330
- Sharp, you all right?
- I'm okay.

1873
02:07:24,410 --> 02:07:26,570
- Bear?
- Yeah. I'm here, Harry.

1874
02:07:26,710 --> 02:07:29,160
- A.J.?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1875
02:07:29,290 --> 02:07:32,990
We lost Gruber.

1876
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:36,620
Gruber's dead.

1877
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:39,170
Let's get that bomb ready and go home.

1878
02:07:47,190 --> 02:07:49,510
Oh, my God.

1879
02:07:49,650 --> 02:07:51,138
Is there a problem, Colonel?

1880
02:07:51,163 --> 02:07:53,924
The timer, the remote,
the whole thing's dead.

1881
02:07:54,030 --> 02:07:56,070
What, the bomb is dead?

1882
02:07:56,200 --> 02:08:00,740
No, the trigger's dead. It must've
gotten damaged during the rock storm.

1883
02:08:01,870 --> 02:08:03,860
So how do we detonate it?

1884
02:08:14,050 --> 02:08:18,790
We have 18 minutes to zero barrier.
We got some bad news.

1885
02:08:18,930 --> 02:08:22,630
The remote detonator on the
bomb has been damaged.

1886
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:25,600
That means that somebody's
gonna have to stay behind.

1887
02:08:28,230 --> 02:08:30,520
It takes two people to fly this thing.

1888
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:34,730
Either we all stay and die,
or you guys draw straws.

1889
02:08:34,860 --> 02:08:39,360
I say we all stay and die. But that's me.

1890
02:08:39,450 --> 02:08:43,940
I'll draw. Let's draw.

1891
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:47,450
Nobody's gonna draw straws.

1892
02:08:47,580 --> 02:08:48,545
I'll stay and take care of it.

1893
02:08:48,570 --> 02:08:50,144
Well, I can't live
with that sort of thing.

1894
02:08:50,250 --> 02:08:51,940
Nobody asked you if you could
live with it, all right?

1895
02:08:51,965 --> 02:08:52,394
Bullshit!

1896
02:08:52,460 --> 02:08:55,080
No way I will let you volunteer for this

1897
02:08:55,170 --> 02:08:58,870
so I can go back to my home country
like the man who didn't volunteer.

1898
02:08:58,970 --> 02:09:00,880
No way!

1899
02:09:00,970 --> 02:09:05,630
Hey, man, let's draw, and let's see
who's gonna stay up here and dance.

1900
02:09:05,770 --> 02:09:08,140
Guys, I'll know you guys
think I'm crazy right now,

1901
02:09:08,270 --> 02:09:11,100
but I would really like
this responsibility.

1902
02:09:11,190 --> 02:09:13,600
All right. All right.

1903
02:09:13,730 --> 02:09:17,780
I can do it. Let's just draw straws
and get it over with. Come on.

1904
02:09:17,860 --> 02:09:19,490
I ain't drawin' against you, Harry.

1905
02:09:19,610 --> 02:09:23,610
Well, I'm gonna draw against you, Chick,
so you better just go ahead and do it.

1906
02:09:23,740 --> 02:09:25,950
Just gimme this thing.

1907
02:09:32,750 --> 02:09:35,290
Is this good or bad?

1908
02:09:40,430 --> 02:09:43,210
Oh, man.

1909
02:09:43,350 --> 02:09:46,930
Well, we all gotta die, right?

1910
02:09:50,310 --> 02:09:52,600
I'm the guy who gets to
do it saving the world.

1911
02:09:52,690 --> 02:09:56,770
So, uh, let's go. We-We got
about ten minutes, right?

1912
02:09:58,650 --> 02:10:00,610
You plug this into the port.

1913
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:05,900
Lift, press, hold. That's it.

1914
02:10:06,040 --> 02:10:09,450
Lift, press, hold. Shouldn't be too tough.
Even I can't screw this up.

1915
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:12,160
I'll take him down.

1916
02:10:46,120 --> 02:10:48,820
Do me a favour, will ya?

1917
02:10:48,910 --> 02:10:52,030
Just tell Grace that, uh

1918
02:10:52,170 --> 02:10:54,870
that I'll always be with her, okay?

1919
02:10:57,090 --> 02:10:59,000
Can you do that?

1920
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:02,710
Yeah. Okay, kid.

1921
02:11:08,770 --> 02:11:10,840
Give this to Truman.

1922
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:15,060
Make sure Truman gets that. Get in there.

1923
02:11:20,070 --> 02:11:22,230
It's my turn now.

1924
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:25,240
Harry! Harry!

1925
02:11:25,370 --> 02:11:30,570
You can't do this to me! It's my job!

1926
02:11:30,660 --> 02:11:35,740
You go take care of my little girl now.
That's your job.

1927
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:40,910
Always thought of you as a son.

1928
02:11:41,050 --> 02:11:42,960
Always.

1929
02:11:43,090 --> 02:11:46,760
But I'd be damn proud to
have you marry Grace.

1930
02:11:46,850 --> 02:11:50,550
- Harry...
- You take care of yourself.

1931
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:52,630
- Harry, no!
- I love you, pal.

1932
02:11:52,770 --> 02:11:55,640
Harry, I love you! Don't, Harry!
Wait a minute!

1933
02:11:55,770 --> 02:11:58,260
- My son.
- Don't do this, Harry!

1934
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:00,940
Don't do this! Harry!

1935
02:12:09,330 --> 02:12:12,280
What happened?

1936
02:12:12,410 --> 02:12:14,290
That crazy, stubborn son of a.

1937
02:12:20,630 --> 02:12:23,500
Well, this was a real good idea.

1938
02:12:23,630 --> 02:12:27,800
All right, let's go, Sharp.
Let's get our team outta here.

1939
02:12:32,730 --> 02:12:37,640
Come on! Let's get ready to
initiate thrusters! Let's go!

1940
02:12:37,770 --> 02:12:40,350
Strap it in, guys! Get the O2 masks.

1941
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:43,690
Are they green? Are they green?

1942
02:12:43,820 --> 02:12:47,320
I can't believe this is going
down like this. You all right?

1943
02:12:47,410 --> 02:12:50,360
- O2 vents locked, pressure loaded.
- Engine board is green.

1944
02:12:52,870 --> 02:12:55,620
T minus three minutes and counting.

1945
02:12:55,710 --> 02:12:58,330
Houston, do you copy?
This is Harry Stamper.

1946
02:12:58,420 --> 02:13:00,330
It's down there.

1947
02:13:03,380 --> 02:13:07,210
<i>- Electrical systems primed.
- APU is set. Oxidizers are loading.</i>

1948
02:13:07,340 --> 02:13:12,010
<i>Houston, we're outta here
in T minus three minutes.</i>

1949
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:15,180
Daddy!

1950
02:13:15,310 --> 02:13:18,150
Hi, Gracie. Hi, honey.

1951
02:13:18,230 --> 02:13:21,680
<i>Grace, I know I promised
you I was comin' home.</i>

1952
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:25,190
I don't under understand.

1953
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:28,360
<i>Looks like I'm gonna have
to break that promise.</i>

1954
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:35,820
I, um, I lied to you, too,

1955
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:39,080
when I told you that I
didn't want to be like you.

1956
02:13:41,090 --> 02:13:43,080
Because I am like you.

1957
02:13:43,210 --> 02:13:48,880
And everything good that I have
inside of me, I have from you.

1958
02:13:48,970 --> 02:13:51,590
I love you so much, Daddy.

1959
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:53,680
I'm so proud of you.

1960
02:13:53,770 --> 02:13:56,220
I'm so scared.

1961
02:13:56,310 --> 02:13:59,060
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

1962
02:13:59,150 --> 02:14:04,190
I know it, baby, but there won't
be anything to be scared of soon.

1963
02:14:06,820 --> 02:14:12,240
<i>Gracie, I want you to know that A.J.
saved us. He did.</i>

1964
02:14:13,660 --> 02:14:15,700
<i>I want you to tell Chick</i>

1965
02:14:15,790 --> 02:14:19,700
<i>that I couldn't have done
it without him, none of it.</i>

1966
02:14:21,290 --> 02:14:23,370
<i>I want you to take care of A.J.</i>

1967
02:14:28,220 --> 02:14:30,970
I wish I could be there to
walk you down the aisle.

1968
02:14:34,310 --> 02:14:36,220
But I'll

1969
02:14:38,150 --> 02:14:41,600
I'll look in on you from
time to time, okay, honey?

1970
02:14:44,070 --> 02:14:45,940
I love you, Grace.

1971
02:14:46,070 --> 02:14:47,780
I love you too.

1972
02:14:47,860 --> 02:14:50,610
- I gotta go now, honey.
- Daddy, no.

1973
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:55,450
No, no, Dad, no.

1974
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:04,580
OMS pod prestart. O2 vents
locked, pressure loaded.

1975
02:15:07,010 --> 02:15:09,130
What the hell's goin' on up there?
Why haven't you guys left yet?

1976
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:11,970
We're going, Harry. Houston.

1977
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:14,630
- We got OMS pod prestart.
- Pod prestart confirmed.

1978
02:15:17,060 --> 02:15:19,140
- What's the problem?
- I don't know.

1979
02:15:19,270 --> 02:15:20,680
- What's wrong?
- Fix it now!

1980
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:24,930
No time, no time!

1981
02:15:25,030 --> 02:15:26,980
- What?
- What's that?

1982
02:15:30,820 --> 02:15:32,981
- Where you goin'?
- Come on. We're stayin', we're goin'.

1983
02:15:33,080 --> 02:15:34,980
We're stayin', we're goin'.
Make up your minds.

1984
02:15:35,080 --> 02:15:37,950
Sharp, get out of here now. You
got less than three minutes.

1985
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:43,790
Come on, Watts. Come on, come on.

1986
02:15:43,880 --> 02:15:45,670
Blow the bomb, Harry. We're with you.

1987
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:49,960
Uh, it's stuck. Yes? You
don't know the components!

1988
02:15:50,050 --> 02:15:55,010
Components, American components, Russian
components. All made in Taiwan!

1989
02:15:55,100 --> 02:15:57,510
We're gettin' tight for ignition, Freedom.

1990
02:15:59,980 --> 02:16:02,180
Houston, we've got no fire.

1991
02:16:02,270 --> 02:16:04,150
- What does that mean?
- It means we got a busted ship.

1992
02:16:04,230 --> 02:16:06,690
A busted ship? And I'm strapped in here.

1993
02:16:06,820 --> 02:16:08,890
I had a great spot picked out there.

1994
02:16:09,030 --> 02:16:12,590
Freedom, you fire that engine. If there's not
a way, you find a way. The clock's tickin'.

1995
02:16:12,620 --> 02:16:14,360
<i>Let's go! Let's fire that engine, Freedom!</i>

1996
02:16:14,450 --> 02:16:17,650
You got less than a minute. Don't
think I won't blow this thing.

1997
02:16:19,460 --> 02:16:22,870
Sharp, get out of here.
It's gettin' bad down here.

1998
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:25,040
I know how to fix it. Please, move.

1999
02:16:25,170 --> 02:16:28,010
I-I have to take you away if you don't move.

2000
02:16:28,090 --> 02:16:30,380
Watts, you gotta get that shuttle started.
You gotta fire it up now!

2001
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:32,670
Damn it, Sharp. Get off this rock!

2002
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:36,210
I'm telling you, please, move!
This is how we fix problem...

2003
02:16:36,350 --> 02:16:39,510
in the Russian space station.

2004
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:43,180
Because I don't want to stay here any more.

2005
02:16:43,270 --> 02:16:48,940
Yeah! Finally! We can go home!

2006
02:16:49,070 --> 02:16:51,390
- She's coming back. She's coming back.
- We're hot!

2007
02:16:51,490 --> 02:16:52,730
Watts! Let's go, let's go!

2008
02:16:53,910 --> 02:16:57,610
Rain all you want, you son of a bitch.

2009
02:16:57,740 --> 02:17:00,860
- Let's go! We don't have time!
- Hurry, hurry. We got no time!

2010
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:03,030
Initiate thrusters on my mark!

2011
02:17:03,130 --> 02:17:04,750
Two, one, mark!

2012
02:17:12,970 --> 02:17:14,850
Come on. Get some altitude.
Let's go, let's go.

2013
02:17:18,020 --> 02:17:19,210
Freedom has max thrust!

2014
02:17:26,570 --> 02:17:28,440
Thank you, Harry.

2015
02:17:39,580 --> 02:17:41,650
Shuttle's out of range.
Still no detonation.

2016
02:17:46,290 --> 02:17:48,330
Something's not right. Too
much time has gone by.

2017
02:17:50,970 --> 02:17:53,290
Zero barrier's about to be breached.
One minute.

2018
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:55,960
Harry, come on. Press that button.

2019
02:17:56,100 --> 02:18:00,260
- We're goin' back and do it ourselves.
- Just don't. Wait one minute.

2020
02:18:04,690 --> 02:18:07,520
- Dan, we're about to cross the threshold.
- Come on. Press the button.

2021
02:18:07,650 --> 02:18:12,480
Colonel, I'm askin' you.
Just one more minute!

2022
02:18:18,740 --> 02:18:20,490
Press the button, Stamper.

2023
02:18:24,170 --> 02:18:25,660
Come on.

2024
02:18:28,250 --> 02:18:30,490
Harry'll do it. I know it.

2025
02:18:30,630 --> 02:18:33,340
He doesn't know how to fail.

2026
02:18:40,890 --> 02:18:42,630
We win, Gracie!

2027
02:18:44,310 --> 02:18:46,470
Press it!

2028
02:19:18,350 --> 02:19:21,710
<i>We have detonation. Confirming detonation.</i>

2029
02:19:38,450 --> 02:19:41,730
The two halves are gonna
miss us by 400 miles...

2030
02:19:41,830 --> 02:19:44,750
and most of the small particles
have been vaporized.

2031
02:19:55,550 --> 02:19:58,470
- Houston, we're comin' home.
<i>- We copy that, Freedom.</i>

2032
02:19:58,590 --> 02:20:02,300
Yo, Harry, you the man.

2033
02:20:55,110 --> 02:20:59,150
Kennedy, we see you. And
you never looked so good.

2034
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:02,950
I never told anybody this
before but I hate flyin',

2035
02:21:03,030 --> 02:21:04,860
so it'd be an awful shame to die now.

2036
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:09,210
That's easy for you to say. I owe
100 grand to a badass loan shark...

2037
02:21:09,330 --> 02:21:11,950
which I spent on a stripper
named Molly Mounds.

2038
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:13,500
Boy, that's bad.

2039
02:21:13,590 --> 02:21:17,830
Kennedy, we are 100 percent.
Flap suspension control on full.

2040
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:32,020
Welcome home, astronauts.

2041
02:21:40,780 --> 02:21:42,990
Hey, guys, remember: We're heroes now.

2042
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:45,480
So that incident with me and
the gun on the asteroid,

2043
02:21:45,580 --> 02:21:48,030
let's keep that under wraps, all right?

2044
02:22:52,270 --> 02:22:55,470
Miss Stamper.

2045
02:22:55,610 --> 02:22:57,980
Colonel Willie Sharp, United
States Air Force, ma'am.

2046
02:22:58,110 --> 02:23:01,980
Requesting permission to shake
the hand of the daughter

2047
02:23:02,110 --> 02:23:04,110
of the bravest man I've ever met.

2048
02:23:10,710 --> 02:23:12,610
Hello.

2049
02:23:12,750 --> 02:23:15,290
- Oh, my God!
- Hi, you're my hero.

2050
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:19,080
Oh, baby, I wanna have babies with you.

2051
02:23:21,010 --> 02:23:22,920
Welcome back, cowboy.

2052
02:23:24,890 --> 02:23:29,100
Uh, Harry wanted you to have this.

2053
02:23:34,940 --> 02:23:36,600
He did, huh?
