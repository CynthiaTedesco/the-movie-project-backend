1
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,413
Captain.
Yes, sir?

2
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:15,665
Tell them we wish to board at once.

3
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,460
With all due respect,

4
00:02:18,544 --> 00:02:21,963
the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor
wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:23,965
Yes, of course.

6
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,177
As you know, our blockade
is perfectly legal,

7
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:31,389
and we'd be happy to
receive the ambassadors.

8
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:56,498
I'm TC-14 at your service.

9
00:02:56,582 --> 00:02:58,500
This way, please.

10
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,676
We are greatly honored
by your Visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,678
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:12,972
My master will be with you shortly.

13
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:18,269
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:21,439
I don't sense anything.
It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:25,485
It's something... elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:29,349
What? What did you say?

17
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:32,435
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

18
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,437
I knew it.

19
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:36,773
They're here to force a settlement.

20
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:40,944
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

21
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:42,946
Are you brain-dead?

22
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,950
I'm not going in there with two Jedi.

23
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:48,993
Send a droid.

24
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:55,292
<i>Is it in their nature to
make us wait this long?</i>

25
00:03:55,377 --> 00:04:00,005
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear for
something as trivial as this trade dispute.

26
00:04:10,892 --> 00:04:12,810
What is it?

27
00:04:12,894 --> 00:04:15,562
This scheme of yours has
failed, Lord Sidious.

28
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:19,233
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

29
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:24,196
Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slime
in my sight again.

30
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,075
<i>This turn of events is unfortunate.</i>

31
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:32,288
We must accelerate our plans.
Begin landing your troops.

32
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:36,125
My lord, is that legal?

33
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,544
I will make it legal.

34
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:40,963
And the Jedi?

35
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:45,467
The chancellor should never have brought
them into this. Kill them immediately.

36
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:49,888
Yes. Yes, my lord. Uh, as you wish.

37
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:53,517
Captain, look!

38
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:56,061
Shields up!

39
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:01,400
Sorry.

40
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:05,070
Dioxis.

41
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,536
They must be dead by now.

42
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,582
Destroy what's left of them.

43
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,841
Oh! Excuse me.

44
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,555
Blast them.

45
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:39,354
What is going on down there?

46
00:05:39,438 --> 00:05:41,439
We lost the transmission, sir.

47
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,947
Have you ever encountered a
Jedi knight before, sir?

48
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,992
Well, no, but I don't-Seal off the bridge.

49
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,828
Yes, sir.
That won't be enough, sir.

50
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:56,913
I want droidekas up here at once!

51
00:05:56,998 --> 00:05:59,624
We will not survive this.

52
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,597
Close the blast doors!

53
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,354
That will hold them.

54
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,574
They are still coming through.

55
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,618
This is impossible!

56
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,958
Where are those droidekas?

57
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:45,295
Master! Destroyers!

58
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,429
They have shield generators!

59
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:57,223
It's a standoff. Let's go.

60
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:03,939
They're no match for droidekas.

61
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:08,526
<i>Sir! They've gone up the ventilation shaft.</i>

62
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:19,996
Battle droids.
It's an invasion army.

63
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,376
This is an odd play for
the Trade Federation.

64
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,629
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

65
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:30,461
Sir, a transmission from the planet.

66
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:33,021
It's Queen Amidala herself.

67
00:07:33,106 --> 00:07:36,817
At last we are getting results.

68
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:39,945
Again you come before us, Your Highness.

69
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:43,156
You will not be so pleased
when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy.

70
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:46,994
Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.

71
00:07:47,078 --> 00:07:49,663
I was not aware of such failure.

72
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:52,499
<i>I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...</i>

73
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,335
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

74
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,713
<i>I know nothing of any ambassadors.</i>

75
00:07:57,797 --> 00:08:00,215
You must be mistaken.

76
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:02,342
Beware, Viceroy.

77
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:05,137
The Federation has gone too far this time.

78
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:09,307
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

79
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:11,977
You assume too much.

80
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:14,896
We will see.

81
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:19,026
She's right. The senate will never-
It's too late now.

82
00:08:19,152 --> 00:08:22,154
Do you think she suspects an attack?
<i>I don't know.</i>

83
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:26,658
But we must move quickly
to disrupt all communications down there.

84
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:35,917
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

85
00:08:36,002 --> 00:08:38,211
How could that be true?

86
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:42,674
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

87
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:46,511
It must-handiwork-negotiate-ambassadors...

88
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:49,306
<i>nobody would-</i>
Senator Palpatine.

89
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,308
What's happening?

90
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:53,310
Check the transmission generator.

91
00:08:53,394 --> 00:08:58,273
<i>A communications disruption</i>
<I>CAN MEAN ONLY ONE THING: invasion.</i>

92
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,008
Captain, we've searched the ship,

93
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:37,218
and there is no trace of the Jedi.

94
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:40,096
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

95
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:42,682
If they're down here, sir, we'll find them.

96
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:47,646
Use caution.
These Jedi are not to be underestimated.

97
00:10:00,951 --> 00:10:03,495
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

98
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:06,665
Get down!

99
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:09,042
Ay-yee-yee! Wha!

100
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:19,135
Was'n dat? Hey, wait!

101
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:21,179
Oh, mooie-mooie! I love you!

102
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:23,473
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

103
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:27,310
I spake. The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

104
00:10:27,436 --> 00:10:30,355
Now, get out of here.
No, no, mesa stay.

105
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:33,483
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

106
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:35,735
That won't be necessary.
Oh, but it 'tis.

107
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,238
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

108
00:10:38,323 --> 00:10:41,783
Oh, no! Whoo!
Stay down!

109
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:50,334
You saved my again.

110
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,336
What's this?
A local.

111
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:56,215
Let's get out of here before
more droids show up. More?

112
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:58,550
"More" did you spake?

113
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:03,555
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

114
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,892
'Tis a hidden city.

115
00:11:07,978 --> 00:11:09,854
A city?
Uh-huh.

116
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,150
Can you take us there?
Uh, on second thought, no.

117
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:16,336
Not really, no.
No?

118
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,287
Da bosses would do terrible tings to me.

119
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:22,457
Terrible tings to me if me goen back dare.

120
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,126
You hear that?
Yah.

121
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:29,005
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

122
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,175
If they find us, they will crush us,

123
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,846
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

124
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,850
Oh. Yousa point is well seen.

125
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:42,352
This way. Hurry!

126
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:50,944
How much further?
Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

127
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:52,946
Ah, my warning you.

128
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:57,201
Gungans no liken outsiders.

129
00:12:34,263 --> 00:12:37,182
So good bein home!

130
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:45,398
Oh, me gusa.
Hata-hata.

131
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:54,449
Hey, yousa.

132
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:55,661
- Stopa dare!

133
00:12:55,746 --> 00:12:57,622
Mesa back!

134
00:12:57,706 --> 00:13:00,708
Noah gain, Jar Jar. Yousa goen tada bosses.

135
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:03,419
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

136
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:05,088
Ohh.

137
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:07,548
<i>Ay, ay.</i>

138
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:10,843
How wude.

139
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:21,896
Tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk!
Yousa cannot bees hair.

140
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,526
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

141
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,531
A droid army is about to attack the Naboo.
We must warn them.

142
00:13:31,615 --> 00:13:35,284
Wesa no like da Naboo.
Tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk.

143
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:38,162
<i>Da Naboo tink day so smarty.</i>

144
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:41,207
Day tink day brains so big.

145
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:45,461
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

146
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:47,922
Mesa no tink so.

147
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:50,883
Day not know of uss-en.

148
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:53,970
You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle.

149
00:13:54,054 --> 00:13:57,473
What happens to one of you will affect the other.
You must understand this.

150
00:13:57,558 --> 00:14:02,353
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

151
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:05,022
Then speed us on our way.

152
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:07,692
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

153
00:14:07,776 --> 00:14:10,570
We could use a transport.

154
00:14:10,654 --> 00:14:13,489
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

155
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:15,583
Now...

156
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,543
go.

157
00:14:17,627 --> 00:14:19,879
Thank you for your help. We leave in peace.

158
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:22,089
Master, what's a bongo?

159
00:14:22,174 --> 00:14:24,175
A transport, I hope.

160
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:28,139
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

161
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:30,605
Master, we're short on time.

162
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:34,400
We'll need a navigator
to get us through the planet's core.

163
00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:36,444
This Gungan may be of help.

164
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:41,657
What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?

165
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:46,621
<i>Hisen to be pune-ished.</i>

166
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:48,998
Ohh.
<i>I saved his life.</i>

167
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:51,584
 He owes me what you call a "life-debt."

168
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:55,546
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

169
00:14:55,631 --> 00:14:58,049
Binkssssss,

170
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:01,761
yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen?

171
00:15:01,845 --> 00:15:05,264
Mm, uh-huh.

172
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:10,728
Begone wit him!

173
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,293
The invasion is on schedule, my lord.

174
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:42,380
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

175
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:46,968
They will have no choice
but to accept your control of the system.

176
00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:51,764
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

177
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:54,892
Queen Amidala is young and naïve.

178
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:58,437
You will find controlling
her will not be difficult.

179
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,481
Yes, my lord.

180
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:04,819
You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi.

181
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:09,448
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

182
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,644
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

183
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:41,480
Ah, victory.

184
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:57,121
Mmm, dis'n loverly.

185
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:50,087
- We should leave the street, Your Highness.
- Get their weapons.

186
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:56,907
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

187
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,536
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

188
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,747
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

189
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,583
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

190
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:10,421
They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion legal.
They can't afford to kill her.

191
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:12,673
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

192
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,758
There's no logic in the
Federation's move here.

193
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,802
My feelings tell me they will destroy you.

194
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:19,346
Our only hope is for the
senate to side with us.

195
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,890
Senator Palpatine will need your help.

196
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:26,019
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

197
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:28,021
We are brave, Your Highness.

198
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:31,358
<i>If you are to leave, Your
Highness, it must be now.</i>

199
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,944
Then I will plead our case to the senate.

200
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:36,822
Be careful, Governor.

201
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,917
We'll need to free those pilots.

202
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,961
I'll deal with that.

203
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:56,884
Halt! I'm ambassador to
the supreme chancellor.

204
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:58,969
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

205
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:02,306
- Where are you taking them?

206
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:07,960
Come on. Move!

207
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:13,942
Go!

208
00:19:38,642 --> 00:19:41,977
Now, stay here and keep out of trouble.

209
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:48,901
Hello, boyos.

210
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:55,908
There's the blockade.

211
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:08,820
The shield generator's been hit!

212
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:17,813
How wude!

213
00:20:28,024 --> 00:20:29,608
We're losing droids fast.

214
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:33,612
<i>If we can't get the shield generator fixed,</i>
<i>we'll be sitting ducks.</i>

215
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:39,326
The shields are gone.

216
00:20:43,664 --> 00:20:46,458
The power's back!

217
00:20:49,212 --> 00:20:52,756
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

218
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,467
Deflector shields up at maximum.

219
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:08,230
<i>There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant.
The hyper-drive is leaking.</i>

220
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:11,233
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

221
00:21:11,318 --> 00:21:13,527
Here, Master. Tatooine.

222
00:21:13,612 --> 00:21:17,239
Small, out of the way, poor. The Trade
Federation have no presence there.

223
00:21:17,324 --> 00:21:19,199
How can you be sure?

224
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:21,243
It's controlled by the Hutts.

225
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:24,204
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

226
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:26,624
- If they discovered her-
- It'd be no different than if we landed...

227
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,584
on a system controlled by the Federation,

228
00:21:28,668 --> 00:21:33,047
except that the Hutts aren't looking
for her, which gives us the advantage.

229
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:40,512
And Queen Amidala, has
she signed the treaty?

230
00:21:40,597 --> 00:21:44,308
She has disappeared, my lord.

231
00:21:44,392 --> 00:21:48,562
One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade.

232
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:51,649
I want that treaty signed.

233
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:53,817
My lord,

234
00:21:53,902 --> 00:21:56,487
it's impossible to locate the ship.

235
00:21:56,571 --> 00:21:58,822
It's out of our range.

236
00:21:58,907 --> 00:22:01,659
Not for a Sith.

237
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:03,661
This is my apprentice,

238
00:22:03,745 --> 00:22:05,704
<i>Darth Maul.</i>

239
00:22:06,956 --> 00:22:10,334
He will find your lost ship.

240
00:22:14,631 --> 00:22:16,965
This is getting out of hand.

241
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,093
Now there are two of them.

242
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:22,262
We should not have made this bargain.

243
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:31,105
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

244
00:22:31,189 --> 00:22:34,108
Without a doubt,
it saved the ship, as well as our lives.

245
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:35,728
It is to be commended.

246
00:22:36,164 --> 00:22:38,999
Padmé.

247
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,251
Clean this droid up as best you can.

248
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:43,337
It deserves our gratitude.

249
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:47,716
Continue, Captain.

250
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,220
Your Highness, with your permission,

251
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:54,389
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

252
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:57,809
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

253
00:22:57,894 --> 00:23:00,562
I do not agree with the Jedi on this.

254
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:03,607
You must trust my judgment, Your Highness.

255
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:11,402
That's it-Tatooine.
There's a settlement.

256
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:15,656
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

257
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:35,718
The hyper-drive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

258
00:23:35,803 --> 00:23:38,262
That'll complicate things. Be wary.

259
00:23:38,388 --> 00:23:41,557
I sense a disturbance in the Force.
I feel it also, Master.

260
00:23:41,642 --> 00:23:44,519
Don't let them send any transmissions.

261
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,821
<i>Wait!</i>

262
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:53,864
Wait.

263
00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:59,620
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

264
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:03,541
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

265
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,709
The spaceport is not going to be pleasant.

266
00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:08,003
The queen wishes it.

267
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:10,047
She's curious about the planet.

268
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:13,634
This is not a good idea.

269
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,678
Stay close to me.

270
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:32,319
Moisture farms, for the most part.

271
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:37,324
Some indigenous tribes and scavengers.

272
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:41,745
The few spaceports like this one are havens
for those that don't wish to be found.

273
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,789
Like us.

274
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:53,271
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

275
00:24:57,985 --> 00:25:00,111
Good day to you.

276
00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:03,031
What do you want?

277
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:06,242
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

278
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:10,455
Ah, yes! Nubian. We have lots of that.

279
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:13,041
Boy, get in here now!

280
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,043
My droid has a readout of what I need.

281
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,339
What took you so long?

282
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:21,549
I was cleaning the fan switches.

283
00:25:21,634 --> 00:25:24,177
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

284
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:27,805
So... let me take thee out back, huh?

285
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,768
Ni you'll find what you need.

286
00:25:31,894 --> 00:25:34,270
Hmm?
Don't touch anything.

287
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:41,783
Are you an angel?
What?

288
00:25:41,868 --> 00:25:45,620
An angel. I heard the deep
space pilots talk about them.

289
00:25:45,705 --> 00:25:48,623
They're the most beautiful creatures
in the universe.

290
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:51,293
They live on the moons of Iego, I think.

291
00:25:51,377 --> 00:25:53,753
You're a funny little boy.

292
00:25:53,838 --> 00:25:55,797
How do you know so much?

293
00:25:55,882 --> 00:25:59,759
I listen to all the traders and star pilots
who come through here.

294
00:25:59,844 --> 00:26:04,139
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

295
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:08,226
You're a pilot?
Mm-hmm. All my life.

296
00:26:08,311 --> 00:26:10,687
How long have you been here?

297
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:14,816
Since I was very little. Three, I think.

298
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:17,652
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt,

299
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:20,447
but she lost us betting on the Podraces.

300
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:22,324
You're a slave?

301
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,661
I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
I'm sorry.

302
00:26:26,746 --> 00:26:30,499
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

303
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,106
A T-14 hyper-drive generator.
Thee in luck.

304
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,859
I'm the only one hereabouts who has one.

305
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:41,446
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, huh?

306
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,532
Saying of which,

307
00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:46,993
how's thee gonna pay for all this, huh?

308
00:26:47,077 --> 00:26:49,203
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

309
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:51,164
Republic credits?

310
00:26:51,248 --> 00:26:54,208
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

311
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:57,420
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

312
00:26:57,546 --> 00:27:01,215
No, they won't.
Credits will do fine.

313
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,134
No, they won't!

314
00:27:03,218 --> 00:27:07,472
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

315
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:11,809
I'm a Toydarian.
Mind tricks don't work on me. Only money.

316
00:27:11,894 --> 00:27:16,064
No money, no parts, no deal.

317
00:27:16,148 --> 00:27:20,693
And no one else has a T-14 hyper-drive,
I promise you that.

318
00:27:27,534 --> 00:27:31,329
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

319
00:27:31,413 --> 00:27:33,915
Oh! Aw! Ooh! Uh!

320
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:36,027
Ai, ai! Whoa, ai!
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

321
00:27:37,547 --> 00:27:40,132
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

322
00:27:40,216 --> 00:27:42,134
I was glad to meet you too.

323
00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:52,022
Outlanders. They think we know nothing.

324
00:27:52,106 --> 00:27:54,065
They seemed nice to me.

325
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,109
Clean the racks...

326
00:27:56,193 --> 00:27:57,569
then you can go home.

327
00:28:05,494 --> 00:28:07,954
And you're sure
there's nothing left on board?

328
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,956
A few containers of supplies.

329
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:13,126
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with,

330
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,545
not in the amount you're talking about.

331
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,131
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

332
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:20,091
I'll check back later.

333
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,641
Wesa be wobbed un crunched!

334
00:28:22,725 --> 00:28:25,894
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

335
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,781
Hmm? Ah, mooie-mooie.

336
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:41,034
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

337
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,578
Are you going to pay for that?

338
00:28:42,662 --> 00:28:44,496
Huh? Wanga?

339
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:46,456
It costs seven wupiupi.

340
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:50,170
<i>Ah! Chubaa-</i>

341
00:28:50,254 --> 00:28:52,589
Oops.

342
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,553
Is this yours?

343
00:28:57,637 --> 00:28:59,346
Who, mesa?

344
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:03,392
Ouch! Ouch!

345
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:05,644
Careful, Sebulba.

346
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:07,771
He's a big-time outlander.

347
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:11,442
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

348
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:15,446
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

349
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:18,616
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

350
00:29:19,284 --> 00:29:22,161
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

351
00:29:23,246 --> 00:29:26,415
- Hi.
- Hi there.

352
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:29,376
<i>Your buddy here was about to be</i>
<i>turned into orange goo.</i>

353
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:32,963
He picked a fight with a Dug,
an especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.

354
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:35,517
Das da las ting mesa want.

355
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:39,846
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

356
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:41,806
Thanks, my young friend.

357
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:43,975
<i>But-But-</i>

358
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,479
But mesa doen nutten!

359
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:56,113
This storm will slow them down.

360
00:29:56,198 --> 00:29:58,908
Looks pretty bad.

361
00:29:59,034 --> 00:30:01,619
Panaka. Receiving
a message from home.

362
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:03,955
We'll be right there.

363
00:30:09,878 --> 00:30:12,046
<i>Here, you'll like these pallies.</i>

364
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,799
Here.
Thank you.

365
00:30:15,926 --> 00:30:18,219
Oh, my bones are aching.

366
00:30:18,303 --> 00:30:22,848
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

367
00:30:22,975 --> 00:30:25,893
Do you have shelter?
We'll head back to our ship.

368
00:30:25,978 --> 00:30:28,604
Is it far?
It's on the outskirts.

369
00:30:28,689 --> 00:30:31,107
You'll never reach the outskirts in time.

370
00:30:31,191 --> 00:30:35,111
Sandstorms are very, Very dangerous.

371
00:30:35,195 --> 00:30:37,697
Come on. I'll take you to my place.

372
00:30:53,011 --> 00:30:54,087
Mom!

373
00:30:54,172 --> 00:30:57,883
<i>Mom, I'm home!
Ahh, dissen cozy.</i>

374
00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:00,385
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

375
00:31:00,512 --> 00:31:04,097
I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

376
00:31:04,182 --> 00:31:06,558
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

377
00:31:06,684 --> 00:31:10,187
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.
Oh, mooie-mooie.

378
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:21,156
Isn't he great? He's not finished yet.

379
00:31:21,241 --> 00:31:23,116
He's wonderful.

380
00:31:23,704 --> 00:31:26,706
He's a protocol droid to help Mom. Watch.

381
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:32,378
Oh. Oh. Uh-Where is everybody?

382
00:31:32,463 --> 00:31:35,798
Whoops. Yeah.

383
00:31:35,883 --> 00:31:38,092
Oh, hello.

384
00:31:38,177 --> 00:31:41,512
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

385
00:31:41,597 --> 00:31:43,173
How might I serve you?

386
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:45,134
He's perfect.
Oh. Perfect.

387
00:31:45,518 --> 00:31:48,363
When the storm is over, I'll show you my racer.
I'm building a Podracer.

388
00:31:50,147 --> 00:31:54,025
I'm not sure this floor is entirely stable.

389
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:57,320
Oh, hello.
I don't believe we have been introduced.

390
00:31:58,698 --> 00:32:01,032
R2-D2. A pleasure to meet you.

391
00:32:01,117 --> 00:32:04,160
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

392
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:10,000
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

393
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:14,963
My parts are showing? My goodness! Oh!

394
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,053
The death toll is catastrophic.

395
00:32:22,138 --> 00:32:24,514
We must bow to their wishes.

396
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,683
You must contact me.

397
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:29,519
It's a trick. Send no reply.

398
00:32:29,604 --> 00:32:33,106
 Send no transmissions of any kind.

399
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:36,776
It sounds like bait to
establish a connection trace.

400
00:32:36,861 --> 00:32:40,864
What if it is true, and
the people are dying?

401
00:32:40,948 --> 00:32:43,491
Either way, we're running out of time.

402
00:32:57,089 --> 00:32:59,257
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

403
00:32:59,342 --> 00:33:02,177
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

404
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:04,179
Move against the Jedi first.

405
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:07,015
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

406
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:09,017
to sign the treaty.

407
00:33:09,101 --> 00:33:11,311
At last we will reveal
ourselves to the Jedi.

408
00:33:11,395 --> 00:33:13,855
At last we will have revenge.

409
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,858
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

410
00:33:16,943 --> 00:33:19,361
They will be no match for you.

411
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,204
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

412
00:33:29,288 --> 00:33:32,290
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

413
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:35,919
Any attempt to escape-
And they blow you up!

414
00:33:36,003 --> 00:33:38,463
Boom!
How wude!

415
00:33:38,547 --> 00:33:41,007
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

416
00:33:41,092 --> 00:33:43,009
The Republic's antislavery laws-

417
00:33:43,094 --> 00:33:45,470
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

418
00:33:45,935 --> 00:33:49,354
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

419
00:33:49,439 --> 00:33:54,109
<i>They have Podracing on Malastare.</i>
<i>Very fast, very dangerous.</i>

420
00:33:54,194 --> 00:33:56,278
I'm the only human who can do it.

421
00:33:56,363 --> 00:33:59,573
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

422
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:02,459
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

423
00:34:04,504 --> 00:34:06,963
What makes you think that?

424
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:11,343
I saw your laser sword.
Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.

425
00:34:11,427 --> 00:34:14,346
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

426
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,348
I don't think so.

427
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:18,600
No one can kill a Jedi.

428
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:21,520
I wish that were so.

429
00:34:21,604 --> 00:34:23,688
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

430
00:34:23,773 --> 00:34:26,900
I came back here and freed all the slaves.

431
00:34:27,026 --> 00:34:30,445
Have you come to free us?
No, I'm afraid not.

432
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,908
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

433
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:42,499
I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin.

434
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,669
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic,

435
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:47,754
on a very important mission.

436
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,966
How did you end up out
here in the outer rim?

437
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:54,678
<i>Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.</i>

438
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:56,888
I can help.

439
00:34:57,014 --> 00:35:00,767
<i>I can fix anything. I believe you can.</i>

440
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:03,728
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

441
00:35:03,749 --> 00:35:06,793
These junk dealers must have
a weakness of some kind.

442
00:35:07,278 --> 00:35:11,781
Gambling. Everything here revolves around
betting on those awful races.

443
00:35:11,865 --> 00:35:16,077
<i>Podracing. Greed can be a powerful ally.</i>

444
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:19,080
I built a racer. It's the fastest ever.

445
00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:21,666
There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve.

446
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:24,377
- You could enter my pod.
<i>- Anakin!</i>

447
00:35:24,461 --> 00:35:27,589
- Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

448
00:35:27,673 --> 00:35:29,549
You could make him think it was yours...

449
00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:31,926
<i>and get him to let me pilot it for you.</i>

450
00:35:32,011 --> 00:35:36,222
<i>I don't want you to race. It's awful.</i>
<i>I die every time Watto makes you do it.</i>

451
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:40,145
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

452
00:35:40,229 --> 00:35:42,564
Anakin.

453
00:35:42,648 --> 00:35:45,483
Your mother's right.

454
00:35:45,568 --> 00:35:48,695
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

455
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:51,906
No.

456
00:35:56,412 --> 00:36:01,041
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

457
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:08,799
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

458
00:36:08,883 --> 00:36:10,801
We'll find some other way.

459
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:13,178
No.

460
00:36:13,263 --> 00:36:15,764
There is no other way.

461
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:20,185
I may not like it, but he can help you.

462
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,896
He was meant to help you.

463
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,370
Are you sure about this?

464
00:36:38,454 --> 00:36:41,165
<i>Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know?</i>

465
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:43,292
The queen will not approve.

466
00:36:43,376 --> 00:36:46,336
The queen doesn't need to know.

467
00:36:46,421 --> 00:36:48,005
Well, I don't approve.

468
00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:51,842
The boy tells me you
want to sponsor him in the race.

469
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:56,972
How can you do this?
Not on the Republic credits, I think, huh?

470
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:59,266
<i>My ship will be the entry fee.</i>

471
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,476
<i>Oh, not bad!</i>

472
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:04,563
Not bad, huh? A Nubian, huh?

473
00:37:04,647 --> 00:37:07,983
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

474
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:10,611
<i>What would the boy ride?</i>

475
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:14,281
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It will take some long time to fix it.

476
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:18,966
I have acquired a pod in a game of chance,
the fastest ever built.

477
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:24,180
<i>I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?</i>

478
00:37:25,641 --> 00:37:28,727
So, you supply the pod and the entry fee,

479
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:30,729
and I supply the boy.

480
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:34,733
<i>We split the winnings,</i>
<i>um, 50-50, I think, huh?</i>

481
00:37:34,817 --> 00:37:39,487
If it's going to be 50-50,
I suggest you front the cash for the entry.

482
00:37:39,572 --> 00:37:41,656
If we win,

483
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:45,577
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

484
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:48,913
And if we lose, you keep my ship.

485
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:52,751
Either way, you win.

486
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:00,884
Deal!

487
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:09,350
Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.

488
00:38:17,276 --> 00:38:20,278
What if this plan fails, Master?

489
00:38:20,362 --> 00:38:23,114
We could be stuck here a very long time.

490
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:25,742
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help,

491
00:38:25,826 --> 00:38:29,287
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

492
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:31,372
And...

493
00:38:31,457 --> 00:38:34,334
there's something about this boy.

494
00:38:39,423 --> 00:38:42,509
You should be very proud of your son.

495
00:38:42,593 --> 00:38:45,637
<i>He gives without any thought of reward.</i>

496
00:38:45,721 --> 00:38:48,598
Well, he knows nothing of greed.

497
00:38:48,724 --> 00:38:52,685
He has a-
He has special powers.

498
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:55,688
Yes.

499
00:38:55,773 --> 00:38:58,483
He can see things before they happen.

500
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:01,402
That's why he appears to
have such quick reflexes.

501
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:03,363
<i>It's a Jedi trait.</i>

502
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:06,324
<i>He deserves better than a slave's life.</i>
Why, certainly.

503
00:39:06,408 --> 00:39:09,786
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

504
00:39:12,164 --> 00:39:14,833
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

505
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:17,877
Who was his father?

506
00:39:20,548 --> 00:39:22,465
There was no father.

507
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:27,262
<i>I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him.</i>

508
00:39:27,346 --> 00:39:30,640
I can't explain what happened.

509
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:34,102
Can you help him?

510
00:39:34,186 --> 00:39:36,145
I don't know.

511
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:42,277
I didn't actually come here to free slaves.

512
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,369
Hey, hi, Ani.

513
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:53,955
Hi.

514
00:39:55,081 --> 00:39:58,292
Wow, a real astro droid.

515
00:39:59,128 --> 00:40:02,881
How did you get so lucky?
That isn't the half of it.

516
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:06,009
I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
<i>What?</i>

517
00:40:06,093 --> 00:40:07,844
With this?

518
00:40:07,928 --> 00:40:10,722
You're such a joker, Ani.

519
00:40:10,848 --> 00:40:14,100
You've been working on that thing for years.
It's never gonna run.

520
00:40:14,184 --> 00:40:16,394
<i>Come on. Let's go and play ball.</i>

521
00:40:16,478 --> 00:40:19,772
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

522
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,156
Hey, Jar Jar.

523
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:30,700
<i>Keep away from those energy binders.</i>

524
00:40:30,784 --> 00:40:34,287
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

525
00:40:34,371 --> 00:40:36,456
Sorry. Okay.

526
00:40:39,877 --> 00:40:42,045
My tongue is fat.

527
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:46,186
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

528
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:50,899
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

529
00:40:50,983 --> 00:40:53,109
It will.
I think it's time we found out.

530
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:55,445
Here, use this power charge.
Yes, sir!

531
00:40:55,529 --> 00:40:56,914
Come on, Kitster. Let's move away.

532
00:40:57,376 --> 00:41:00,378
You're quite right. He's very odd indeed.

533
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:20,777
It's working! It's working!

534
00:41:31,414 --> 00:41:33,915
Stay still, Ani. Let me clean this cut.

535
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,003
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

536
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:39,963
Most of them.

537
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:42,090
Has anyone been to 'em all?

538
00:41:42,174 --> 00:41:45,010
Not likely.

539
00:41:45,094 --> 00:41:48,179
I wanna be the first one to see 'em all.

540
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,933
<i>Ani, bedtime!</i> Ow!

541
00:41:52,018 --> 00:41:54,769
There we are. Good as new.

542
00:41:54,854 --> 00:41:57,731
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

543
00:41:57,857 --> 00:42:01,359
What are you doing?
Checking your blood for infections.

544
00:42:01,444 --> 00:42:05,113
Go on. You have a big day tomorrow.

545
00:42:05,197 --> 00:42:07,115
Sleep well, Ani.

546
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,870
Obi-Wan?
Yes, Master?

547
00:42:11,954 --> 00:42:14,622
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

548
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:18,084
Wait a minute.

549
00:42:20,132 --> 00:42:22,800
The reading is off the chart.

550
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:24,761
Over 20,000.

551
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:28,556
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

552
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,433
No Jedi has.

553
00:42:30,517 --> 00:42:32,602
What does that mean?

554
00:42:32,686 --> 00:42:34,645
I'm not sure.

555
00:43:44,008 --> 00:43:46,969
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

556
00:43:47,053 --> 00:43:50,806
Patience, my blue friend. You'll have
your winnings before the suns set.

557
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,142
And we'll be far away from here.

558
00:43:53,226 --> 00:43:56,812
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

559
00:43:56,896 --> 00:44:00,774
I warn you, no funny business.

560
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,027
You don't think Anakin can win?
Don't get me wrong, no.

561
00:44:04,112 --> 00:44:06,655
I have great faith in the boy.

562
00:44:06,739 --> 00:44:08,907
He's a credit to your race,

563
00:44:08,992 --> 00:44:12,244
but, uh, Sebulba there is
going to win, I think.

564
00:44:13,711 --> 00:44:15,587
Why do you think that?

565
00:44:15,672 --> 00:44:19,508
He always wins!

566
00:44:19,592 --> 00:44:22,094
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

567
00:44:23,888 --> 00:44:27,224
- I'll take that bet.
- You what?

568
00:44:27,308 --> 00:44:30,727
I'll wager my new racing pod against, say,

569
00:44:30,812 --> 00:44:32,729
the boy and his mother.

570
00:44:32,814 --> 00:44:36,525
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

571
00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:39,194
The boy, then.

572
00:44:39,278 --> 00:44:41,988
Hmm. Well, uh...

573
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,953
We'll let fate decide, huh?

574
00:44:48,037 --> 00:44:51,498
I just happen to have a chance cube here.

575
00:44:51,582 --> 00:44:54,668
Blue, it's the boy.

576
00:44:54,752 --> 00:44:58,964
Red, uh... his mother.

577
00:45:08,641 --> 00:45:13,311
You won this small toss, outlander,
but you won't win the race!

578
00:45:13,396 --> 00:45:15,522
So it makes little difference!

579
00:45:23,324 --> 00:45:28,245
Better stop your friend's
betting or I'll end up owning him too.

580
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,543
What'd he mean by that?
I'll tell you later.

581
00:45:34,627 --> 00:45:36,712
Good morning.

582
00:45:36,796 --> 00:45:38,797
Oh, my.

583
00:45:38,882 --> 00:45:40,883
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

584
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:46,972
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

585
00:45:47,056 --> 00:45:50,476
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

586
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,855
- Do what?
- Finish the race, of course.

587
00:45:54,939 --> 00:45:59,568
- You've never won a race?
- Well, not exactly.

588
00:45:59,652 --> 00:46:01,695
Not even finished?

589
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,323
Kitster's right. I will this time.

590
00:46:04,407 --> 00:46:06,492
Of course you will.

591
00:46:33,353 --> 00:46:35,479
Podracers.

592
00:46:35,564 --> 00:46:37,481
That's absolutely right.

593
00:46:37,566 --> 00:46:42,653
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

594
00:46:42,738 --> 00:46:46,365
<i>I see the contestants are making their way</i>
<i>out onto the starting grid.</i>

595
00:46:48,452 --> 00:46:51,329
<i>I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund System.</i>

596
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,420
<i>Two-time winner Boles Roor.</i>

597
00:47:01,923 --> 00:47:04,592
<i>Sebulba!</i>

598
00:47:08,724 --> 00:47:12,059
<i>And a late entry, young Anakin Skywalker,</i>

599
00:47:12,144 --> 00:47:14,645
<i>a local boy.</i>

600
00:47:16,106 --> 00:47:18,441
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

601
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:41,484
You won't walk away from this one...

602
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:43,861
you slave scum.

603
00:47:43,946 --> 00:47:47,239
Don't count on it, slime ball.

604
00:47:47,324 --> 00:47:49,575
You're bantha fodder!

605
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:56,540
You all set, Ani?
Yep.

606
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:58,542
Right.
Whoa!

607
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:05,049
Remember, concentrate on the moment.

608
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:08,928
Feel, don't think. Use your instincts.

609
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:10,680
I will.

610
00:48:10,764 --> 00:48:13,015
May the Force be with you.

611
00:48:19,942 --> 00:48:22,986
Jabba the Hutt.

612
00:48:25,406 --> 00:48:27,907
Mmm.

613
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:35,832
Welcome.

614
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:40,461
Begin the race!

615
00:48:45,848 --> 00:48:49,059
<i>Hey, it looks
like they're clearing the grid.</i>

616
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:52,145
Is he nervous?
He's fine.

617
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:56,650
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not...

618
00:48:56,734 --> 00:48:59,653
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

619
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:01,655
You should too.

620
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:04,199
You assume too much.

621
00:49:04,283 --> 00:49:07,369
<i>Start your engines.</i>

622
00:49:48,474 --> 00:49:51,142
Oh, no! No!

623
00:49:55,397 --> 00:49:58,733
Wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.

624
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:13,414
<i>Well, it looks like
Quadinaros is having engine trouble also.</i>

625
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:17,502
Come on, Ani!

626
00:50:22,716 --> 00:50:25,885
<i>- And there goes Skywalker!</i>
- Go, Ani, go!

627
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:28,179
<i>He will be hard-pressed</i>
<i>to catch up with the leaders.</i>

628
00:50:30,182 --> 00:50:33,893
Ehh!

629
00:51:26,754 --> 00:51:31,591
<i>Looks like a few Tusken Raiders</i>
<i>are camped out on the canyon dune turn.</i>

630
00:51:38,474 --> 00:51:41,517
<i>Doowat macroon!</i>

631
00:51:43,812 --> 00:51:47,523
Ooh, there goes Quadinaros' power coupling.

632
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:51,110
<i>Cheespa wata!</i>

633
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:52,820
Ooh!

634
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:56,824
- Chubba ni chees Sebulba!
<i>- Paketa!</i>

635
00:51:56,909 --> 00:51:58,618
<i>Kulkah meeka!</i>

636
00:51:58,827 --> 00:52:03,373
Ody Mandrell coona wa wunda dungo!

637
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:11,798
Whoa!

638
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:17,428
Oh, no!

639
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:20,390
Oh.

640
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:25,353
Where is Master Anakin?

641
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:29,649
Look. Here he comes.

642
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:34,821
<i>It looks like
Skywalker is moving up in the field.</i>

643
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:37,156
Yay! Yippee!

644
00:52:39,663 --> 00:52:42,665
He has to complete two more circuits?

645
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,709
Oh, dear.

646
00:53:19,087 --> 00:53:23,049
Oh, I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

647
00:53:49,057 --> 00:53:50,849
Here he comes! Owoo!

648
00:53:50,934 --> 00:53:54,102
<i>At the start of the
final lap, Sebulba's in the lead,</i>

649
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:56,688
<i>followed closely by Skywalker!</i>

650
00:53:56,773 --> 00:53:58,357
Go, Ani!

651
00:54:25,091 --> 00:54:29,052
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

652
00:54:33,432 --> 00:54:36,184
Whoa-oa!

653
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,904
Huh?

654
00:54:49,241 --> 00:54:52,911
- It's Skywalker!
- Sebulba!

655
00:54:52,995 --> 00:54:57,332
Amazing!

656
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:37,836
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

657
00:56:18,307 --> 00:56:21,017
He's catching Sebulba!
<i>Inkabunga!</i>

658
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,148
<i>Wha-Chuba da noya!</i>

659
00:56:47,967 --> 00:56:51,345
That little human being is out of his mind.
<i>Punda tah punda!</i>

660
00:56:51,471 --> 00:56:54,056
<i>They're side by side!</i>
Bangu du bangu!

661
00:57:01,272 --> 00:57:03,398
Wa-waaaaah!

662
00:57:10,865 --> 00:57:12,783
Aaah!

663
00:57:13,993 --> 00:57:15,911
<i>Poo doo!</i>

664
00:57:21,292 --> 00:57:23,210
Yippee!
Yay!

665
00:57:23,294 --> 00:57:25,921
Ya eeka buta! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

666
00:57:26,005 --> 00:57:29,174
I can't believe it.

667
00:57:29,258 --> 00:57:31,176
The crowds are going nuts!

668
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,428
Boonta! Boonta!

669
00:57:35,598 --> 00:57:38,876
Boonta! Boonta! Boonta! Boonta!

670
00:57:39,061 --> 00:57:41,145
Yay, Ani!

671
00:57:41,439 --> 00:57:44,525
Mom, I did it! Yeah!

672
00:57:51,991 --> 00:57:53,951
Ohh!

673
00:57:54,994 --> 00:57:56,912
Good going, Ani!

674
00:58:01,251 --> 00:58:03,252
We owe you everything, Ani.

675
00:58:03,336 --> 00:58:05,754
Mmm!
<i>Aww.</i>

676
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:08,006
It's so wonderful, Ani.

677
00:58:08,091 --> 00:58:10,843
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

678
00:58:10,927 --> 00:58:13,178
I'm so very proud of you.

679
00:58:15,265 --> 00:58:17,182
<i>Aww.</i>

680
00:58:17,267 --> 00:58:19,685
<i>Oy chuba no.</i>

681
00:58:23,606 --> 00:58:25,524
You.

682
00:58:25,608 --> 00:58:27,943
You swindled me!

683
00:58:28,027 --> 00:58:31,905
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

684
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,907
I lost everything.

685
00:58:33,992 --> 00:58:36,910
Whenever you gamble,
my friend, eventually you'll lose.

686
00:58:36,995 --> 00:58:39,913
Bring the parts to the main hangar.

687
00:58:39,998 --> 00:58:43,333
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

688
00:58:43,418 --> 00:58:46,795
You can't have him. It wasn't a fair bet.

689
00:58:49,507 --> 00:58:52,426
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

690
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:54,595
I'm sure they can settle this.

691
00:58:57,056 --> 00:58:59,016
Take him.

692
00:59:05,899 --> 00:59:07,816
Hidoe!

693
00:59:07,901 --> 00:59:10,819
Well, we have
all the essential parts we need.

694
00:59:10,904 --> 00:59:14,072
I'm going back.
Some unfinished business. I won't be long.

695
00:59:14,157 --> 00:59:17,659
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

696
00:59:17,744 --> 00:59:21,622
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

697
00:59:21,706 --> 00:59:23,624
<i>Get this hyper-drive generator installed.</i>

698
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:26,293
Yes, Master. That shouldn't take long.

699
00:59:26,377 --> 00:59:28,545
Come on. Hup!

700
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:36,303
Hey. These are yours.

701
00:59:36,387 --> 00:59:38,347
Yes!

702
00:59:39,808 --> 00:59:41,683
Mom, we sold the pod!

703
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:44,186
Look at all the money we have!
My goodness!

704
00:59:44,312 --> 00:59:47,231
But that's so wonderful, Ani.
<i>And he has been freed.</i>

705
00:59:47,315 --> 00:59:50,108
- What?
- You're no longer a slave.

706
00:59:51,986 --> 00:59:53,946
Did you hear that?

707
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:57,199
Now you can make your
dreams come true, Ani.

708
00:59:57,283 --> 01:00:00,035
You are free.

709
01:00:03,122 --> 01:00:05,040
Will you take him with you?

710
01:00:05,124 --> 01:00:07,459
Is he to become a Jedi?
Yes.

711
01:00:07,544 --> 01:00:09,461
Our meeting was not a coincidence.

712
01:00:09,546 --> 01:00:12,005
<i>Nothing happens by accident.</i>

713
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:15,676
You mean I get to come
with you in your starship?

714
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,678
Anakin,

715
01:00:19,055 --> 01:00:22,391
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge,

716
01:00:22,475 --> 01:00:25,394
and even if you succeed, it's a hard life.

717
01:00:25,478 --> 01:00:28,689
But I wanna go.
It's what I've always dreamed of doing.

718
01:00:28,773 --> 01:00:31,650
Can I go, Mom?

719
01:00:31,734 --> 01:00:33,986
Anakin,

720
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:37,322
this path has been placed before you.

721
01:00:37,407 --> 01:00:39,950
The choice is yours alone.

722
01:00:43,538 --> 01:00:45,455
I wanna do it.

723
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,251
<i>Then pack your things.</i>
<i>We haven't much time.</i>

724
01:00:49,335 --> 01:00:51,461
Yippee!

725
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:57,468
What about Mom?

726
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,473
Is she free too?

727
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:06,102
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

728
01:01:06,186 --> 01:01:09,147
You're coming with us, aren't you, Mom?

729
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:20,450
Son, my place is here. My future is here.

730
01:01:20,534 --> 01:01:23,953
<i>It is time for you to let go.</i>

731
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,013
Now hurry.

732
01:01:38,019 --> 01:01:39,937
Thank you.

733
01:01:40,021 --> 01:01:42,940
I'll watch after him. You have my word.

734
01:02:07,383 --> 01:02:10,301
I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.

735
01:02:10,386 --> 01:02:13,096
Ani.

736
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:16,599
Will I ever see you again?

737
01:02:18,019 --> 01:02:20,937
What does your heart tell you?

738
01:02:22,273 --> 01:02:24,524
I hope so.

739
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:26,526
Yes.

740
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,528
I guess.

741
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:31,531
Then we will see each other again.

742
01:02:34,535 --> 01:02:37,454
I will come back and free you, Mom.

743
01:02:37,538 --> 01:02:39,497
I promise.

744
01:02:47,339 --> 01:02:50,717
Now, be brave...

745
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:53,511
and don't look back.

746
01:02:53,596 --> 01:02:55,513
Don't look back.

747
01:03:40,226 --> 01:03:43,228
Anakin! Drop!

748
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:48,650
Go! Tell them to take off!

749
01:04:00,206 --> 01:04:02,124
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

750
01:04:02,208 --> 01:04:03,917
Take off.

751
01:04:05,003 --> 01:04:06,837
Over there. Fly low.

752
01:04:27,734 --> 01:04:29,652
Are you all right?

753
01:04:29,736 --> 01:04:31,654
I think so.

754
01:04:31,738 --> 01:04:33,656
What was it?

755
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:37,159
I'm not sure,
but it was well-trained in the Jedi arts.

756
01:04:37,243 --> 01:04:40,245
My guess is it was after the queen.

757
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:42,873
What are we gonna do about it?

758
01:04:44,793 --> 01:04:46,710
We shall be patient.

759
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:49,630
Anakin Skyalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

760
01:04:49,714 --> 01:04:51,924
- Hi.

761
01:04:52,008 --> 01:04:55,761
You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.

762
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:10,892
The death toll is catastrophic.

763
01:05:10,976 --> 01:05:13,603
We must bow to their wishes.

764
01:05:13,687 --> 01:05:15,980
You must contact me.

765
01:05:30,037 --> 01:05:31,996
You all right?

766
01:05:32,081 --> 01:05:34,791
It's very cold.

767
01:05:42,758 --> 01:05:45,677
You come from a warm planet, Ani.

768
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:48,179
A little too warm for my taste.

769
01:05:48,264 --> 01:05:50,556
Space is cold.

770
01:05:50,641 --> 01:05:52,850
You seem sad.

771
01:05:53,936 --> 01:05:56,271
The queen is worried.

772
01:05:56,355 --> 01:05:58,731
Her people are suffering, dying.

773
01:05:58,816 --> 01:06:02,402
She must convince the
senate to intervene, or...

774
01:06:03,862 --> 01:06:06,197
I'm not sure what'll happen.

775
01:06:07,574 --> 01:06:09,701
I made this for you...

776
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,037
so you'd remember me.

777
01:06:14,961 --> 01:06:16,879
It's beautiful.

778
01:06:16,963 --> 01:06:19,381
But I don't need this to remember you by.

779
01:06:23,011 --> 01:06:26,430
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani,

780
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:29,099
but my caring for you will remain.

781
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:34,980
I care for you, too, only I...

782
01:06:35,065 --> 01:06:37,233
Miss your mother.

783
01:06:55,669 --> 01:06:59,880
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

784
01:06:59,965 --> 01:07:01,757
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

785
01:07:01,842 --> 01:07:05,135
<i>And look over there.</i>
<i>Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.</i>

786
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:37,668
It is a great gift to see
you alive, Your Majesty.

787
01:07:37,752 --> 01:07:40,588
<i>With the communications breakdown,</i>
<i>we've been very concerned.</i>

788
01:07:40,672 --> 01:07:43,382
<i>I'm anxious to hear your
report on the situation.</i>

789
01:07:43,466 --> 01:07:46,093
May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

790
01:07:46,177 --> 01:07:50,347
Welcome, Your Highness. It's an honor
to finally meet you in person.

791
01:07:50,432 --> 01:07:53,058
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

792
01:07:53,143 --> 01:07:56,312
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

793
01:07:56,396 --> 01:07:59,157
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

794
01:08:00,233 --> 01:08:03,152
I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

795
01:08:03,236 --> 01:08:05,154
There is a question of procedure,

796
01:08:05,238 --> 01:08:07,990
but I'm confident we can overcome it.

797
01:08:08,074 --> 01:08:10,993
I must speak with the Jedi
Council immediately.

798
01:08:11,077 --> 01:08:13,954
The situation has become
much more complicated.

799
01:08:17,669 --> 01:08:19,629
Ani, come on.

800
01:08:42,693 --> 01:08:44,944
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

801
01:08:45,028 --> 01:08:47,947
There is little chance
the senate will act on the invasion.

802
01:08:48,031 --> 01:08:50,950
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

803
01:08:51,034 --> 01:08:55,162
<i>If I may say so, Your Majesty,</i>
<i>the chancellor has little real power.</i>

804
01:08:55,247 --> 01:08:59,125
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

805
01:08:59,251 --> 01:09:03,004
<i>The bureaucrats are in charge now.</i>
What options have we?

806
01:09:03,088 --> 01:09:06,674
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

807
01:09:06,758 --> 01:09:08,676
of a stronger supreme chancellor,

808
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,262
one who could control the bureaucrats...

809
01:09:11,346 --> 01:09:13,222
and give us justice.

810
01:09:13,306 --> 01:09:17,601
You could call for a
Vote of no confidence...

811
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:19,603
in Chancellor Valorum.

812
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:22,231
He has been our strongest supporter.

813
01:09:22,315 --> 01:09:27,570
Our only other choice
would be to submit a plea to the courts.

814
01:09:27,654 --> 01:09:31,032
The courts take even longer to
decide things than the senate.

815
01:09:31,116 --> 01:09:34,035
<i>Our people are dying, Senator.</i>

816
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:37,872
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

817
01:09:37,956 --> 01:09:40,583
To be realistic, Your Majesty,

818
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:45,755
I think we're going to have to accept
Federation control for the time being.

819
01:09:47,466 --> 01:09:49,550
That is something I cannot do.

820
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:58,977
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

821
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:03,022
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

822
01:10:03,107 --> 01:10:07,318
Impossible. The Sith have been
extinct for a millennium.

823
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:11,614
<i>I do not believe the Sith</i>
<i>could have returned without us knowing.</i>

824
01:10:11,699 --> 01:10:14,826
Ah, hard to see, the dark side is.

825
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:17,829
<i>We will use all our resources</i>
<i>to unravel this mystery.</i>

826
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:20,957
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

827
01:10:21,041 --> 01:10:23,001
May the Force be with you.

828
01:10:26,505 --> 01:10:28,464
Master Qui-Gon.

829
01:10:28,549 --> 01:10:31,009
<i>More to say have you?</i>

830
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:35,179
With your permission, my master,

831
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,684
I have encountered a vergence in the Force.

832
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:42,812
A vergence, you say?

833
01:10:42,896 --> 01:10:45,064
Located around a person?

834
01:10:45,149 --> 01:10:47,066
A boy.

835
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,536
<i>You refer to the prophecy...</i>

836
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,038
<i>of the one who will bring
balance to the Force.</i>

837
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:53,957
You believe it's this boy?

838
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,709
I don't presume to-
<i>But you do.</i>

839
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,462
Revealed your opinion is.

840
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:01,589
I request the boy be tested, Master.

841
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:06,928
<i>Oh? Trained as a Jedi you
request for him, hmm?</i>

842
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:09,806
Finding him was the will of the Force.

843
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,850
I have no doubt of that.

844
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:20,567
Bring him before us, then.

845
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:33,496
The boy's here to see Padmé.

846
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:35,540
Let him in.

847
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:42,338
I'm sorry, Ani,
but Padmé's not here right now.

848
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,757
<i>Who is it?</i>

849
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:47,886
<i>Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,</i>
<i>Your Highness.</i>

850
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,888
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

851
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,993
I'm on my way to the Jedi temple.

852
01:11:52,477 --> 01:11:56,355
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

853
01:11:56,439 --> 01:11:58,357
We will tell her for you.

854
01:11:58,441 --> 01:12:01,068
We are sure her heart goes with you.

855
01:12:01,152 --> 01:12:03,278
Thank you, Your Highness.

856
01:12:14,177 --> 01:12:16,928
Honorable representatives of the Republic,

857
01:12:17,013 --> 01:12:20,140
I come to you
under the gravest of circumstances.

858
01:12:20,224 --> 01:12:23,268
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade-

859
01:12:23,352 --> 01:12:26,813
<i>I object! There is no proof!</i>

860
01:12:26,898 --> 01:12:28,815
This is incredible.

861
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:32,986
We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo
to ascertain the truth.

862
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:35,322
<i>The Congress of Malastare concurs...</i>

863
01:12:35,406 --> 01:12:38,241
with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

864
01:12:38,326 --> 01:12:40,744
A commission must be appointed.
The point...

865
01:12:40,828 --> 01:12:43,997
Excuse me, Chancellor. <i>
Enter the bureaucrat.</i>

866
01:12:44,081 --> 01:12:46,792
The true rulers of the Republic.

867
01:12:46,876 --> 01:12:51,046
And on the payroll of the Trade Federation,
I might add.

868
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:55,383
This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength
will disappear.

869
01:12:56,928 --> 01:12:59,304
<i>The point is conceded.</i>

870
01:12:59,388 --> 01:13:02,307
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

871
01:13:02,391 --> 01:13:04,935
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

872
01:13:05,019 --> 01:13:06,937
I will not defer.

873
01:13:07,021 --> 01:13:10,565
I've come before you to resolve this attack
on our sovereignty now.

874
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:13,693
<i>I was not elected</i>
<i>to watch my people suffer and die...</i>

875
01:13:13,778 --> 01:13:16,530
<i>while you discuss this invasion</i>
<i>in a committee.</i>

876
01:13:18,741 --> 01:13:21,827
If this body is not capable of action,

877
01:13:21,911 --> 01:13:24,955
I suggest new leadership is needed.

878
01:13:26,707 --> 01:13:29,584
I move for a vote of no confidence...

879
01:13:29,669 --> 01:13:31,670
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

880
01:13:35,761 --> 01:13:37,929
<i>Vote now! Vote now!</i>

881
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:40,807
Vote now! Vote now!

882
01:13:40,933 --> 01:13:43,685
Vote now!
Vote now! Order!

883
01:13:43,769 --> 01:13:46,688
Now they will elect a new chancellor,

884
01:13:46,772 --> 01:13:48,690
a strong chancellor,

885
01:13:48,774 --> 01:13:51,693
one who will not let our tragedy continue.

886
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:57,699
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

887
01:13:57,783 --> 01:14:00,743
Anakin will become a Jedi, I promise you.

888
01:14:00,828 --> 01:14:03,746
Do not defy the council, Master,
not again.

889
01:14:03,831 --> 01:14:06,624
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

890
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:12,255
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

891
01:14:12,339 --> 01:14:15,508
They will not
go along with you this time.

892
01:14:15,593 --> 01:14:18,511
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

893
01:14:21,807 --> 01:14:23,182
A ship.

894
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:26,769
A cup.

895
01:14:26,854 --> 01:14:28,688
<i>A ship.</i>

896
01:14:29,773 --> 01:14:32,317
A speeder.

897
01:14:34,278 --> 01:14:36,195
Hmm.

898
01:14:38,824 --> 01:14:40,742
How feel you?

899
01:14:40,826 --> 01:14:42,744
Cold, sir.

900
01:14:43,954 --> 01:14:45,872
Afraid are you?

901
01:14:45,956 --> 01:14:47,916
No, sir.

902
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,627
See through you we can.

903
01:14:50,711 --> 01:14:52,629
Be mindful of your feelings.

904
01:14:52,713 --> 01:14:55,506
<i>Your thoughts dwell on your mother.</i>

905
01:14:55,803 --> 01:14:58,305
Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm?

906
01:14:58,602 --> 01:15:01,688
Fear is the path to the dark side.

907
01:15:01,772 --> 01:15:04,691
Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate.

908
01:15:04,775 --> 01:15:08,194
Hate leads to suffering.

909
01:15:10,702 --> 01:15:13,620
I sense much fear in you.

910
01:15:26,509 --> 01:15:29,928
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

911
01:15:30,013 --> 01:15:31,930
I don't know.

912
01:15:32,352 --> 01:15:35,104
I hope not.

913
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:37,815
Gungans no dyin' without a fight.

914
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,817
Wesa warriors.

915
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:43,321
Wesa got a grand army.

916
01:15:43,409 --> 01:15:46,285
<i>Your Highness?</i>

917
01:15:47,413 --> 01:15:49,580
Your Highness.

918
01:15:49,665 --> 01:15:52,834
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

919
01:15:52,918 --> 01:15:55,003
<i>as supreme chancellor.</i>

920
01:15:55,087 --> 01:15:58,006
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

921
01:15:58,090 --> 01:16:02,802
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

922
01:16:02,886 --> 01:16:04,595
Who else has been nominated?

923
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:09,017
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

924
01:16:09,101 --> 01:16:14,063
I feel confident our situation
will create a strong sympathy vote for us.

925
01:16:15,774 --> 01:16:17,775
I will be chancellor.

926
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:20,528
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats,

927
01:16:20,612 --> 01:16:23,865
<i>there'll be nothing left of our people,</i>
<i>our way of life.</i>

928
01:16:23,949 --> 01:16:25,867
I understand your concern, Your Majesty.

929
01:16:25,951 --> 01:16:29,495
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

930
01:16:31,248 --> 01:16:35,376
Senator, this is your arena.

931
01:16:35,461 --> 01:16:37,420
I feel I must return to mine.

932
01:16:40,007 --> 01:16:42,925
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

933
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:45,011
Go back?
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.

934
01:16:45,095 --> 01:16:47,013
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

935
01:16:47,097 --> 01:16:49,515
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

936
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,143
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

937
01:16:52,227 --> 01:16:54,145
Captain.
<i>Your Highness.</i>

938
01:16:54,229 --> 01:16:56,147
Ready my ship.

939
01:16:56,231 --> 01:16:59,942
Please, Your Majesty, stay
here where it's safe.

940
01:17:00,027 --> 01:17:03,237
It is clear to me now
that the Republic no longer functions.

941
01:17:03,322 --> 01:17:07,658
<i>I pray you will bring</i>
<i>sanity and compassion back to the senate.</i>

942
01:17:17,836 --> 01:17:20,421
The Force is strong with him.

943
01:17:20,506 --> 01:17:22,465
He is to be trained, then?

944
01:17:23,884 --> 01:17:26,969
No, he will not be trained.

945
01:17:27,054 --> 01:17:28,805
No?

946
01:17:31,266 --> 01:17:33,350
He is too old.

947
01:17:33,435 --> 01:17:37,271
He is the chosen one. You must see it.

948
01:17:37,355 --> 01:17:42,026
Mmm. Clouded this boy's future is.

949
01:17:44,195 --> 01:17:46,030
I will train him, then.

950
01:17:50,368 --> 01:17:53,203
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

951
01:17:53,288 --> 01:17:56,290
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

952
01:17:56,374 --> 01:17:58,751
Impossible to take on a second.

953
01:17:58,835 --> 01:18:00,502
The code forbids it.

954
01:18:00,629 --> 01:18:04,048
Obi-Wan is ready.
I am ready to face the trials.

955
01:18:04,132 --> 01:18:07,801
Our own counsel we will
keep on who is ready.

956
01:18:07,886 --> 01:18:09,803
He is headstrong,

957
01:18:09,888 --> 01:18:13,265
and he has much to learn of the
living Force, but he is capable.

958
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:15,392
There is little more he can learn from me.

959
01:18:17,937 --> 01:18:19,855
<i>Young Skywalker's fate...</i>

960
01:18:19,939 --> 01:18:21,815
will be decided later.

961
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:24,485
Now is not the time for this.

962
01:18:24,569 --> 01:18:27,237
<i>The senate is voting for a
new supreme chancellor,</i>

963
01:18:27,322 --> 01:18:30,032
<i>and Queen Amidala is returning home,</i>

964
01:18:30,116 --> 01:18:33,369
which will put pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

965
01:18:33,453 --> 01:18:35,788
And draw out the queen's attacker.

966
01:18:35,872 --> 01:18:40,292
<i>Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.</i>

967
01:18:41,544 --> 01:18:43,462
This is the clue we need...

968
01:18:43,546 --> 01:18:45,839
to unravel the mystery of the Sith.

969
01:18:45,924 --> 01:18:48,759
May the Force be with you.

970
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:04,858
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

971
01:19:04,943 --> 01:19:06,860
From your point of view.

972
01:19:06,945 --> 01:19:10,364
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

973
01:19:10,448 --> 01:19:13,367
His fate is uncertain. He's not dangerous.

974
01:19:13,451 --> 01:19:15,869
The council will decide Anakin's future.

975
01:19:15,954 --> 01:19:18,872
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

976
01:19:24,713 --> 01:19:28,298
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

977
01:19:28,383 --> 01:19:30,634
You won't be, Ani.

978
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:34,847
I'm not allowed to train you,
so I want you to watch me and be mindful.

979
01:19:37,934 --> 01:19:40,602
Your focus determines your reality.

980
01:19:40,691 --> 01:19:42,608
I don't understand.

981
01:19:42,693 --> 01:19:46,195
With time and training, Ani, you will.
You will.

982
01:19:50,033 --> 01:19:54,287
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to
continue to serve and protect you.

983
01:19:54,371 --> 01:19:56,289
I welcome your help.

984
01:19:56,373 --> 01:19:59,792
Senator Palpatine fears
that the Federation means to destroy me.

985
01:19:59,876 --> 01:20:03,087
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

986
01:20:03,171 --> 01:20:06,090
Wesa goin' ho-o-o-me!

987
01:20:06,174 --> 01:20:09,093
Come on, R2.

988
01:20:17,644 --> 01:20:20,730
Is the planet secure?

989
01:20:20,814 --> 01:20:24,734
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

990
01:20:24,818 --> 01:20:27,945
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

991
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:33,909
Good. I will see to it that in the senate
things stay as they are.

992
01:20:33,994 --> 01:20:37,913
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

993
01:20:37,998 --> 01:20:39,915
Yes, my lord.

994
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,917
A Sith here?

995
01:20:47,299 --> 01:20:49,800
Those are the forward stabilizers.

996
01:20:49,885 --> 01:20:52,303
And those two control the pitch?

997
01:20:53,847 --> 01:20:55,765
You catch on pretty quick.

998
01:20:55,849 --> 01:20:57,767
<i>As soon as we land,</i>

999
01:20:57,851 --> 01:21:00,603
<i>the Federation will arrest you</i>
<i>and force you to sign the treaty.</i>

1000
01:21:00,687 --> 01:21:04,440
<i>I agree. I'm not sure</i>
<i>what you wish to accomplish by this.</i>

1001
01:21:04,524 --> 01:21:07,443
I will take back what's ours.

1002
01:21:07,527 --> 01:21:09,987
<i>There are too few of us, Your Highness.</i>

1003
01:21:10,072 --> 01:21:11,989
We have no army.

1004
01:21:12,074 --> 01:21:15,659
<i>And I can only protect you.</i>
<i>I can't fight a war for you.</i>

1005
01:21:15,744 --> 01:21:17,745
Jar Jar Binks.

1006
01:21:17,829 --> 01:21:20,873
Mesa, Your Highness?

1007
01:21:20,957 --> 01:21:22,876
Yes. I need your help.

1008
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,842
I have one battleship on my scope.

1009
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:32,052
<i>It's a droid control ship.</i>

1010
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:34,054
<i>They've probably spotted us.</i>

1011
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,181
We haven't much time.

1012
01:21:59,952 --> 01:22:04,414
Your Honor, Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1013
01:22:11,678 --> 01:22:15,848
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1014
01:22:15,932 --> 01:22:18,225
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1015
01:22:18,309 --> 01:22:21,478
I come before you in peace.

1016
01:22:21,563 --> 01:22:24,440
<i>Ah, Naboo biggen.</i>

1017
01:22:24,524 --> 01:22:27,735
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1018
01:22:27,819 --> 01:22:31,572
Yousa all bombad.

1019
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:35,284
<i>We have searched you out</i>
<i>because we wish to form an alliance.</i>

1020
01:22:35,368 --> 01:22:37,286
Your Honor.

1021
01:22:37,955 --> 01:22:40,874
Whosa dis?

1022
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,918
I am Queen Amidala.
Huh?

1023
01:22:44,879 --> 01:22:46,796
This is my decoy,

1024
01:22:46,881 --> 01:22:50,258
my protection, my loyal bodyguard.

1025
01:22:50,342 --> 01:22:54,679
<i>I'm sorry for my deception,</i>
<i>but it was necessary to protect myself.</i>

1026
01:22:54,764 --> 01:22:57,682
<i>Although we do not always
agree, Your Honor,</i>

1027
01:22:57,767 --> 01:23:00,685
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1028
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:02,687
- Ah.
- The Trade Federation...

1029
01:23:02,772 --> 01:23:04,981
has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1030
01:23:05,066 --> 01:23:08,401
<i>If we do not act quickly,</i>
<i>all will be lost forever.</i>

1031
01:23:08,486 --> 01:23:10,737
I ask you to help us.

1032
01:23:10,821 --> 01:23:13,573
No, I beg you to help us.

1033
01:23:13,657 --> 01:23:16,034
<i>We are your humble servants.</i>

1034
01:23:18,996 --> 01:23:22,582
Our fate is in your hands.

1035
01:23:22,666 --> 01:23:25,167
Mmm.

1036
01:23:31,552 --> 01:23:34,512
<i>Ha!</i>

1037
01:23:37,766 --> 01:23:42,061
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1038
01:23:44,523 --> 01:23:48,443
Me-e-esa lika dis!

1039
01:23:48,527 --> 01:23:50,361
<i>Maybe...</i>

1040
01:23:50,446 --> 01:23:53,031
wesa...

1041
01:23:53,115 --> 01:23:55,033
bein friends.

1042
01:24:00,205 --> 01:24:03,124
Yippee! Ya-hoo!

1043
01:24:03,208 --> 01:24:05,543
We've sent our patrols.

1044
01:24:05,628 --> 01:24:09,130
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1045
01:24:09,214 --> 01:24:11,424
It won't be long, my lord.

1046
01:24:11,508 --> 01:24:14,677
This is an unexpected move for her.

1047
01:24:14,762 --> 01:24:16,804
It's too aggressive.

1048
01:24:16,889 --> 01:24:19,349
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1049
01:24:19,433 --> 01:24:22,018
<i>Let them make the first move.</i>

1050
01:24:22,102 --> 01:24:24,062
Yes, my master.

1051
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:26,119
What is the situation?

1052
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:28,521
Almost everyone's in camps.

1053
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:31,857
A few hundred police and guards have
formed an underground resistance movement.

1054
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:34,527
<i>I brought back</i>
<i>as many of the leaders as I could.</i>

1055
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:39,281
The Federation army's also much larger
than we thought, and much stronger.

1056
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:43,703
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1057
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:45,705
The battle is a diversion.

1058
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:48,299
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1059
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,359
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1060
01:24:51,084 --> 01:24:53,669
<i>R2.</i>

1061
01:24:53,753 --> 01:24:57,381
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1062
01:24:57,465 --> 01:24:59,383
Once we get to the main entrance,

1063
01:24:59,467 --> 01:25:02,302
Captain Panaka will create a diversion.

1064
01:25:02,387 --> 01:25:05,347
<i>Then we can enter the palace</i>
<i>and capture the viceroy.</i>

1065
01:25:05,432 --> 01:25:08,726
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1066
01:25:09,011 --> 01:25:10,928
If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness,

1067
01:25:11,013 --> 01:25:13,264
he will return with another droid army.

1068
01:25:13,348 --> 01:25:16,601
Well, that is why we must not
fail to get the viceroy.

1069
01:25:16,685 --> 01:25:18,603
Everything depends on it.

1070
01:25:24,026 --> 01:25:26,611
She is more foolish than I thought.

1071
01:25:26,695 --> 01:25:31,657
We are sending all troops to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1072
01:25:31,742 --> 01:25:34,452
It appears to be made up of primitives.

1073
01:25:34,536 --> 01:25:37,121
This will work to our advantage.

1074
01:25:37,206 --> 01:25:39,999
I have your approval to
proceed, then, my lord?

1075
01:25:40,083 --> 01:25:42,543
Wipe them out.

1076
01:25:44,213 --> 01:25:46,172
All of them.

1077
01:26:16,954 --> 01:26:18,913
Halt!

1078
01:26:21,792 --> 01:26:24,085
Starting up the shield.

1079
01:27:09,257 --> 01:27:13,176
Once we get inside, you find a
safe place to hide and stay there.

1080
01:27:38,247 --> 01:27:41,374
I thought the battle
was going to take place far from here.

1081
01:27:41,459 --> 01:27:44,002
This is too close.

1082
01:27:49,091 --> 01:27:50,634
Ani, find cover.

1083
01:27:52,428 --> 01:27:54,721
Quick!
Get to your ships!

1084
01:28:48,947 --> 01:28:51,365
- Fighters straight ahead.
- Roger, Bravo Leader.

1085
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:52,742
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1086
01:29:42,546 --> 01:29:45,798
Activate the droids.
Yes, sir.

1087
01:30:02,315 --> 01:30:04,191
Ouch time.

1088
01:30:18,290 --> 01:30:20,666
Fire!

1089
01:30:30,979 --> 01:30:33,522
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1090
01:30:33,607 --> 01:30:36,626
<i>Red group! Blue group! Everybody, this way!</i>

1091
01:30:36,737 --> 01:30:39,155
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1092
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,699
- But I-
- Stay in that cockpit.

1093
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:55,714
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1094
01:31:51,615 --> 01:31:54,117
Let's go!

1095
01:32:03,004 --> 01:32:06,423
Try to override it.

1096
01:33:04,899 --> 01:33:07,400
We don't have time for this, Captain.

1097
01:33:13,032 --> 01:33:14,408
There they are.

1098
01:33:14,493 --> 01:33:16,869
<i>That's where the autopilot's taking us.</i>

1099
01:33:29,903 --> 01:33:32,279
The deflector shield is too strong.

1100
01:33:40,834 --> 01:33:43,794
<i>R2, get us off this autopilot.</i>

1101
01:33:43,879 --> 01:33:46,047
It's gonna get us both killed.

1102
01:33:51,557 --> 01:33:53,350
<i>Go back?</i>

1103
01:33:53,434 --> 01:33:57,771
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1104
01:34:03,619 --> 01:34:07,789
Hang on.

1105
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:16,672
Go!

1106
01:34:20,969 --> 01:34:22,761
Ascension guns!

1107
01:36:34,987 --> 01:36:36,988
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1108
01:37:07,333 --> 01:37:10,794
Jar Jar! Jump, Jar Jar, jump!

1109
01:37:20,429 --> 01:37:23,681
Put down your weapons. They win this round.

1110
01:37:36,570 --> 01:37:38,822
We're hit, R2! Aah!

1111
01:37:44,919 --> 01:37:48,004
I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop!

1112
01:37:55,764 --> 01:37:59,183
This is not good.

1113
01:38:42,688 --> 01:38:46,608
No!

1114
01:39:15,982 --> 01:39:19,109
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1115
01:39:19,194 --> 01:39:23,155
<i>Time for you to sign the treaty and end
this pointless debate in the senate.</i>

1116
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:25,032
<i>Viceroy!</i>

1117
01:39:25,116 --> 01:39:27,117
Your occupation here has ended.

1118
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:31,997
After her. This one's a decoy.

1119
01:39:38,546 --> 01:39:41,173
<i>Captain!</i>

1120
01:39:48,723 --> 01:39:51,350
Jam the doors.

1121
01:39:54,145 --> 01:39:57,690
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1122
01:40:59,961 --> 01:41:02,254
<i>Yes! We have power.</i>

1123
01:41:02,339 --> 01:41:04,882
Shields up.

1124
01:41:08,634 --> 01:41:10,385
Take this!

1125
01:41:16,188 --> 01:41:17,706
We're losing power.

1126
01:41:17,732 --> 01:41:20,942
There seems to be a problem with
the main reactor. <i>Impossible!</i>

1127
01:41:21,027 --> 01:41:22,944
Nothing can get through our shield.

1128
01:41:24,155 --> 01:41:26,948
Let's get outta here.

1129
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:36,750
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1130
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:41,296
We didn't hit it.

1131
01:41:44,384 --> 01:41:47,928
Now, this is Podracing.

1132
01:41:48,012 --> 01:41:51,807
- Look, one of ours, out of the main hold!
- Whoo!

1133
01:41:56,187 --> 01:41:59,189
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
- Hee-hee!

1134
01:42:10,950 --> 01:42:12,219
What the-

1135
01:42:12,581 --> 01:42:16,167
The control ship has been destroyed. Look!

1136
01:43:06,637 --> 01:43:10,056
No, it-it's too late.

1137
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:12,517
No.
Obi-Wan.

1138
01:43:13,227 --> 01:43:15,145
Promise...

1139
01:43:15,229 --> 01:43:17,481
Promise me you will train the boy.

1140
01:43:17,565 --> 01:43:19,524
Yes, Master.

1141
01:43:23,112 --> 01:43:26,156
He is the chosen one.

1142
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:29,534
He... will bring balance.

1143
01:43:30,703 --> 01:43:32,621
Train him.

1144
01:43:59,607 --> 01:44:01,441
Now, Viceroy,

1145
01:44:01,526 --> 01:44:04,986
you're going to have to go back to
the senate and explain all this.

1146
01:44:06,697 --> 01:44:09,991
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise good-bye.

1147
01:44:23,756 --> 01:44:27,300
We are indebted to you for your bravery,
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1148
01:44:27,385 --> 01:44:29,261
And you, young Skyalker.

1149
01:44:29,345 --> 01:44:33,431
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1150
01:44:39,855 --> 01:44:42,482
Congratulations on your
election, Chancellor.

1151
01:44:42,567 --> 01:44:46,027
Your boldness has saved
our people, Your Majesty.

1152
01:44:46,112 --> 01:44:48,030
It's you who should be congratulated.

1153
01:44:48,114 --> 01:44:52,076
Together we shall bring
peace and prosperity to the Republic.

1154
01:44:56,456 --> 01:45:01,543
Confer on you the level of Jedi knight
the council does.

1155
01:45:01,628 --> 01:45:06,381
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1156
01:45:06,466 --> 01:45:08,425
I do not.

1157
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:10,552
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1158
01:45:13,014 --> 01:45:15,933
The chosen one the boy may be.

1159
01:45:16,017 --> 01:45:17,935
Nevertheless,

1160
01:45:18,019 --> 01:45:20,938
grave danger I fear in his training.

1161
01:45:21,022 --> 01:45:24,608
Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1162
01:45:24,692 --> 01:45:26,610
I will train Anakin.

1163
01:45:26,694 --> 01:45:29,113
Ohh!

1164
01:45:29,197 --> 01:45:32,116
Without the approval of the
council, if I must.

1165
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,618
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you.

1166
01:45:34,702 --> 01:45:36,620
Need that you do not.

1167
01:45:38,706 --> 01:45:42,000
Agree with you the council does.

1168
01:45:43,044 --> 01:45:46,380
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1169
01:46:13,949 --> 01:46:16,451
What will happen to me now?

1170
01:46:16,535 --> 01:46:19,663
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1171
01:46:19,747 --> 01:46:23,124
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1172
01:46:31,926 --> 01:46:35,011
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1173
01:46:35,096 --> 01:46:38,556
Mmm. Always two there are.

1174
01:46:38,641 --> 01:46:41,768
No more, no less.

1175
01:46:41,852 --> 01:46:44,646
A master and an apprentice.

1176
01:46:44,730 --> 01:46:46,648
But which was destroyed?

1177
01:46:46,732 --> 01:46:49,651
The master or the apprentice?

1178
01:47:14,301 --> 01:47:16,386
Hello, everybody!

1179
01:48:03,017 --> 01:48:04,934
Peace!

1180
01:48:05,019 --> 01:48:07,896
Ya-hoo!
