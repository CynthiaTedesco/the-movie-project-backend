00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:26,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can tell them the truth.</font>

145
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the captain, not their parent.</font>

146
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't take all of this personally</font>

147
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or the stress will kill you.</font>

148
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't help it. It's my responsibility.</font>

149
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:49,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ONE WEEK LATER</font>

150
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye-bye.</font>

151
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our target. William Parsons.</font>

152
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:11,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is the head of development
at an energy company in Yewaire.</font>

153
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:15,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His department works on
the mining of uranium</font>

154
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and obtaining yellowcake
in foreign countries.</font>

155
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:22,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why we couldn't figure out
where the yellowcake came from.</font>

156
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">October, 2014.</font>

157
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The month he was investigated.</font>

158
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was the same time
the unmarked yellowcake was smuggled in.</font>

159
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly.</font>

160
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My guy says that William still has access
to an abundant amount of yellowcake.</font>

161
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he has just acquired the technology
to make 30 bombs.</font>

162
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The situation in Yewaire is tense.</font>

163
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If that yellowcake is still there,</font>

164
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he wants to finish the deal
and get rid of it.</font>

165
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must follow this lead.</font>

166
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:58,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is another report on William</font>

167
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about a sexual abuse case of a young girl.</font>

168
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? And all evidence points to him.</font>

169
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My guy talked to the girl and she said</font>

170
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">William never took off his necklace</font>

171
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because he said it contains a secret</font>

172
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:15,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that would turn the world into chaos.</font>

173
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:22,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got it.</font>

174
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:23,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going straight there.</font>

175
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:25,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And tomorrow morning,</font>

176
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abu will publish a full-page report.</font>

177
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do something to sabotage their plan.</font>

178
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't take this any further.</font>

179
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You already know</font>

180
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the terrorists are onto you.</font>

181
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what?</font>

182
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not about scaring you,</font>

183
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">nor it is about you being scared.</font>

184
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Albert, you know better than anyone</font>

185
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why I left those big newspapers.</font>

186
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's because they always do
selective reporting</font>

187
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and covered up the truth!</font>

192
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but there are limits.</font>

193
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you forget what you stand for?</font>

194
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I definitely won't risk</font>

more important than life.</font>

197

198
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Foreign Ministry sent
an urgent message.</font>

199
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 days ago,
there was a coup in Yewaire.</font>

the Central Military Commission,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">and evacuate all Chinese citizens.</font>

204
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:33,792

207
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,542

groups of citizens and expats</font>

209
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In addition, sources claim
that many people were missing</font>

210
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,667

214
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an act by the country's
extremist group Zaka.</font>

01:16:41,417 --> 01:16:42,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's 8 against 150 people.</font>

841
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:45,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever done anything
like this before?</font>

842
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:46,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our unit's mission</font>

843
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:47,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is not to deal with those 150 people.</font>

844
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:51,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's to rescue the Chinese hostage.</font>

845
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So is there no hope for the others?</font>

846
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:00,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no time.</font>

847
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:06,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it possible</font>

848
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for you</font>

849
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to save one more person?</font>

850
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:12,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there any chance of that?</font>

851
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your assistant, Abu</font>

852
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:22,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has been executed.</font>

853
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:32,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When did that happened?</font>

854
01:17:33,167 --> 01:17:34,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before we got here.</font>

855
01:18:12,958 --> 01:18:14,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My husband and child</font>

856
01:18:14,292 --> 01:18:16,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">died on a bus just like today.</font>

857
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>In 2005,</font>

858
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:31,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>when they blew up the bus in London.</font>

859
01:18:34,917 --> 01:18:36,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The police told me</font>

860
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that nothing was left of them,</font>

861
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:45,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but a little blue bracelet.</font>

862
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:51,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's when</font>

863
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I vowed to fight against them to the end.</font>

864
01:18:54,917 --> 01:18:56,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To fight against the terrorist groups.</font>

865
01:18:56,792 --> 01:18:58,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not afraid of anything,</font>

866
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">even death.</font>

867
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:04,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm only afraid
of being powerless to help.</font>

868
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:08,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've failed to protect anyone.</font>

869
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:12,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not even Abu. I've failed to protect him.</font>

870
01:19:12,792 --> 01:19:14,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've failed.</font>

871
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:22,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The captain says, the only support</font>

872
01:19:22,667 --> 01:19:25,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will be a chopper for evacuation,</font>

873
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:26,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but they can't say when.</font>

874
01:19:29,542 --> 01:19:30,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In addition to Mei Deng,</font>

875
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:33,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to rescue the others too.</font>

876
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:35,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have a strategy?</font>

877
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With so many people,</font>

878
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:43,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can't take that road back.</font>

879
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's better</font>

880
01:19:44,958 --> 01:19:47,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to go north through the desert,</font>

881
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:48,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">straight to the army base.</font>

882
01:19:48,292 --> 01:19:51,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The problem is we'll be exposed
if they started to chase us.</font>

883
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:52,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mei Deng is the priority.</font>

884
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:55,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once she's safely out,</font>

885
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:57,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we regroup and get the hostages.</font>

886
01:19:58,375 --> 01:20:00,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quickly tell Shitou and Li Tong</font>

887
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:02,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to disguise themselves as terrorists</font>

888
01:20:02,875 --> 01:20:03,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and infiltrate the camp.</font>

889
01:20:04,292 --> 01:20:08,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember.
Li Tong and Mei Deng will trade clothes.</font>

890
01:20:08,292 --> 01:20:10,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shitou will take her back the way we came.</font>

891
01:20:10,792 --> 01:20:12,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell Shun Gu and Dong Li.</font>

892
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:13,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find an overwatch</font>

893
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:15,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where they can control the square.</font>

894
01:20:16,792 --> 01:20:18,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once we enter the town,</font>

895
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:20,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all our signals will be jammed.</font>

896
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:22,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I have to tell Yu Zhuang</font>

897
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:23,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to set up an anti-jamming device</font>

898
01:20:23,833 --> 01:20:26,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to secure our communications.</font>

899
01:20:27,042 --> 01:20:27,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As for Nan Xia,</font>

900
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have her stay here with Yu Zhuang.</font>

901
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:31,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll go as soon as Mei Deng's out.</font>

902
01:20:31,792 --> 01:20:33,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finally, you, Chen Lu and I</font>

903
01:20:33,542 --> 01:20:35,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will watch the square.</font>

904
01:20:35,417 --> 01:20:39,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once we know Mei Deng is safe
and has arrived at Bella's house,</font>

905
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:40,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we'll blow up</font>

906
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:41,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">their access to the camp.</font>

907
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:43,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The 3 of us will go into the camp</font>

908
01:20:44,042 --> 01:20:46,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and rescue the other hostages.</font>

909
01:20:47,917 --> 01:20:49,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if Li Tong is with them,</font>

910
01:20:49,917 --> 01:20:51,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a battle breaks out in the square,</font>

911
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:52,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we won't have enough firepower.</font>

912
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:54,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're already outnumbered.</font>

913
01:20:54,542 --> 01:20:55,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll switch with Mei Deng.</font>

914
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:57,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I look more like her too.</font>

915
01:21:00,167 --> 01:21:02,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain, I think that's not a bad idea.</font>

916
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I disagree.</font>

917
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:20,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know nothing.</font>

918
01:21:33,917 --> 01:21:35,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have nothing to say?</font>

919
01:21:35,292 --> 01:21:36,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

920
