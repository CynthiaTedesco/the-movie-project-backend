1
00:00:02,774 --> 00:00:05,046
Every human being
has a basic instinct.

2
00:00:00,414 --> 00:00:02,782
This work done by:
|| killer_sub ||

3
00:00:06,037 --> 00:00:07,687
To help each other out.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,085
If a hiker gets lost in the mountains,

5
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:12,615
people coordinate a search.

6
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,534
If an earthquake levels the city,

7
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:19,978
people all over the world
send emergency supplies.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,599
This instinct is found
in every culture.

9
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:26,166
Without exception.

10
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:32,400
At around 4:30am our satellites

11
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:36,411
detected a storm approaching
the ARES 3 mission side on Mars.

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,373
The storm had escalated to severe

13
00:00:42,123 --> 00:00:44,169
and we had no choice
but to abort the mission.

14
00:00:46,188 --> 00:00:47,839
But, during the evacuation,

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,345
astronaut Marc Watney was killed.

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,079
---

16
00:01:01,377 --> 00:01:02,938
I'm entering this log for the record.

17
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:05,857
This is Marc Watney,

18
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,083
and I'm still alive,

19
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:10,070
obviously.

20
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:13,553
I have no way to contact NASA

21
00:01:14,089 --> 00:01:15,173
or my crew mates.

22
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,927
But, even if I could,
it would take four years

23
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:17,905
four years

24
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,746
for another manned mission
to reach me,

25
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,123
and I'm in a Hab
designed to last 31 days.

26
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:26,211
So, in the face of overwhelming odds,
I'm left with only one option.

27
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,880
I'm gonna have to science
the shit out of this.

28
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,090
Okay,

29
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:34,191
let's do the math.

30
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:37,013
I got to figure out how to grow
four years worth of food, here,

31
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,682
on a planet where nothing grows.

32
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:42,572
But, if I can't figure out a way
to make contact with NASA,

33
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:44,854
none of this matters anyway.

34
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,691
NOUVEAU MESSAGE

35
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,778
Houston be advised, we've got a video
message.

36
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,214
It's directed to the crew.

37
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,220
Play it.

38
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:54,882
---

39
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,326
Mark Watney is still alive.

40
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,293
---

41
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,747
In your face, Neil Armstrong.

42
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,416
---

43
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:05,146
We left him behind.

44
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:06,781
Let's go get our boy.

45
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,350
This is something NASA rejected.

46
00:02:09,482 --> 00:02:11,756
So, we're talking mutiny.

47
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:13,800
And if we mess up
the supply rendez-vous,

48
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,759
we die.

49
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,762
If we mess-up
the earth gravity assist,

50
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:20,640
we die.

51
00:02:30,662 --> 00:02:31,639
It's space,

52
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,206
it doesn't cooperate.

53
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,739
I guarantee you,

54
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:37,156
that at some point,

55
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,660
everything is gonna go south on you.

56
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,582
And you're gonna say "this is it".

57
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,544
"This is how I end."

58
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:52,130
Is it possible
that he's still alive?

59
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:53,752
|| killer_sub ||

60
00:02:53,905 --> 00:02:56,776
Its name.

61
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:59,845
---

62
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:00,846
