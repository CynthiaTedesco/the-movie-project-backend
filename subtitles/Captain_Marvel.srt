1
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,927
Do you know what time it is?

2
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,512
Can't sleep.

3
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,597
There are tabs for that.

4
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,808
Yeah, but then I'd be sleeping.

5
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,893
Dreams again?

6
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,733
Wanna fight?

7
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,279
I slipped.

8
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,240
Right, you slipped as a result of me
punching you in the face.

9
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,409
I was already slipping
when you happened to punch me in the face.

10
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,077
The two events were not related.

11
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,787
Tell me about this dream.

12
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,834
-Anything new?
-No.

13
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,631
You have to let go of the past.

14
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,966
I don't remember my past.

15
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,470
It's causing you doubt,
and doubt makes you vulnerable.

16
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,729
Control it.

17
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,984
Lose control again, and you'll have to
commune with the Supreme Intelligence.

18
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,987
There's nothing more dangerous to a warrior
than emotion.

19
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,117
Humor is a distraction.

20
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,915
And anger?
Anger only serves the enemy.

21
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,554
<i>One hundred twenty days
since the last Skrull attack.</i>

22
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,808
Has anyone ever seen what
the Supreme Intelligence really looks like?

23
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:49,020
No one can look upon
the Supreme Intelligence in its true form.

24
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,314
You know that.

25
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,651
Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us.

26
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:58,071
So it's sacred. It's personal.

27
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,073
No Kree divulges it, ever.

28
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,408
Who do you see?

29
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,451
-Your brother?
-No.

30
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,786
-Father?
-No.

31
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,996
-Your old commander?
-Vers.

32
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,415
It's me you see, isn't it?

33
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,251
I see what you're trying to do.

34
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,836
-Is it working?
-Yes.

35
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,671
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

36
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,173
What is the point of giving me these...

37
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,050
if you don't want me to use them?

38
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,885
I want you to use them.

39
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,762
The Supreme Intelligence gave me
a responsibility...

40
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,764
of showing you how to use them.

41
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,932
I know how.

42
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,934
Yeah, if that were true, you'd be able to
knock me down without them.

43
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,855
Control your impulses.

44
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,275
Stop using this,
start using this.

45
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:40,030
I want you to be
the best version of yourself.

46
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,238
Vers.

47
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,824
Intelligence.

48
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,119
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.

49
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,329
I am.

50
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,832
You struggle with your emotions...

51
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,835
with your past, which fuels them.

52
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,590
You are just one victim
of the Skrull expansion...

53
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,843
that has threatened our civilization
for centuries.

54
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,930
Imposters who silently infiltrate...

55
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,140
then take over our planets.

56
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,560
Horrors that you remember...

57
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,271
and so much that you do not.

58
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,612
It's all blank.
My life.

59
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,074
You're supposed to take the form
of who I most admire...

60
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:10,620
but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.

61
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:15,208
Perhaps this is a mercy
sparing you from a deeper pain.

62
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,670
Freeing you to do what all Kree must...

63
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,007
put your people's needs
before your own.

64
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,551
We've given you a great gift.

65
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,262
The chance to fight
for the good of all Kree.

66
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,889
I want to serve.

67
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,975
Then master yourself.

68
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,728
What was given can be taken away.

69
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,150
I won't let you down.

70
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,360
We'll know soon enough.

71
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,446
You have a mission.

72
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,283
Serve well, and with honor.

73
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,638
This can't be good.

74
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,682
Must be another Skrull attack.

75
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,267
Whatever it is, it's big.

76
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,519
Has a Skrull ever simmed you?

77
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,729
Once.

78
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,065
-It was deeply disturbing.
-Why?

79
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,442
Because I stared into
the face of my mortal enemy...

80
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,486
and the face staring back
was my own.

81
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,530
Maybe if you were more attractive,
then it would be less disturbing.

82
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,657
You think you're funny,
but I'm not laughing.

83
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,950
You never laugh.

84
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,620
I laugh on the inside.

85
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,288
I'm not doing that now.

86
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,749
It's funny 'cause, objectively speaking,
you're quite handsome.

87
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, thank you.

88
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,252
Listen up, team.
Knock it off.

89
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,712
All right.

90
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,548
Prepare for...

91
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,260
a search and rescue
of our spy, Soh-Larr.

92
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,639
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

93
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,599
This time, Torfa.

94
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,767
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

95
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:59,270
The signal was intercepted,
and his cover's blown.

96
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,401
The Skrull general, Talos,
has sent kill units to find him.

97
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,111
Should they reach him before we do...

98
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,239
the intelligence he's acquired
over three years is as good as theirs.

99
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,119
The Accusers will bomb
a Skrull stronghold here in the south.

100
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,038
We slip in, we locate Soh-Larr...

101
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,625
and we get out,
leaving them none the wiser.

102
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,377
The Torfan populace.

103
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,547
We are not to interfere with them,
nor them with us.

104
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:29,009
Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.

105
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,844
Proceed with caution.

106
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,388
Follow protocol before extracting him.

107
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,558
This is a dangerous mission.

108
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:41,062
We must all be ready to join the Collective
if that is our fate today.

109
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,230
For the good of all Kree.

110
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,398
For the good of all Kree!

111
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,137
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.

112
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,932
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva, find elevation.

113
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,285
Locals on the periphery.

114
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,454
Maybe a dozen.

115
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:22,956
Minn-Erva?

116
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,252
Do you read me? Does anybody copy?

117
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,170
Repeat.

118
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,769
His beacon's coming from that temple.
Let's move.

119
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,731
No. This is a perfect spot
for an ambush.

120
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,024
Only one way in, only one way out.

121
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,692
We can get past the locals.

122
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,445
We don't know if they are locals.
Too risky.

123
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,696
You don't have to go with me.
I'll go alone.

124
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:55,780
No, you won't.

125
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,871
Right. We keep a close radius.

126
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,081
We lose comms,
we meet back at the <i>Helion.</i>

127
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,417
Come on.

128
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,972
Att-Lass, you getting this?

129
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,515
Copy. I see them.

130
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,735
Get back!

131
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,445
Commander?

132
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,288
Get back! Back!

133
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,708
Minn-Erva? Do you have eyes on this?

134
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,336
Keep them back.
Minn-Erva?

135
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,713
Does anybody copy?

136
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,177
I don't wanna hurt you.

137
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:02,972
Keep back!

138
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,477
Stay back!

139
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,025
They're locals.
I found two dead. No green.

140
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,819
They're just starving.

141
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,887
HGX-78.

142
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,807
TRT79-VVX6.

143
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,311
Get back.

144
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,612
Skrulls!

145
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,298
Vers!

146
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,550
<i>Vers? Skrulls.</i>

147
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,552
<i>It's an ambush.</i>

148
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,572
Incoming!

149
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,204
Back to the <i>Helion.</i>

150
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,747
<i>Vers. Do you copy?</i>

151
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,333
<i>Back to the</i> Helion.

152
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,626
<i>Come in. Vers.</i>

153
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,461
How did you know the code?

154
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,506
How about I tell you my secret...

155
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,551
when you've told me yours?

156
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,598
<i>Let's open her up.</i>

157
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,987
<i>Where are we?</i>

158
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,572
<i>Stand by.</i>

159
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,575
Where's your head at?

160
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,787
In the clouds. Where's yours?

161
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:34,249
On my shoulders.
About to show these boys how we do it.

162
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,875
You ready?

163
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,002
-Higher, further, faster, baby.
-That's right.

164
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,347
<i>This can't be right.</i>

165
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,600
<i>Go back even further.</i>

166
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,274
You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!

167
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,331
<i>Who is this person?
Are we in the right...?</i>

168
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,667
What the hell are you thinking?
You don't belong out here!

169
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,127
<i>I think we went back too far.</i>

170
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,628
You let him drive.

171
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,172
<i>Let me try something.</i>

172
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,759
Give up already!

173
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,552
You don't belong out here!

174
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,057
You're not strong enough.

175
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,558
You'll kill yourself.

176
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,940
They'll never let you fly.

177
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,443
<i>Am I the only one that's confused here?</i>

178
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,737
You're a decent pilot.

179
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:46,905
But you're too emotional.

180
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,783
You do know why they call it a cockpit,
don't you?

181
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,502
A huge rumble throughout
the cosmos shook the moon...

182
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:03,630
and the sun and the stars in the sky.

183
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,675
And so, little Alouette flew up
throughout the night.

184
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,552
Did you see her?
It's Alouette.

185
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,098
Get your butts inside,
it's time to eat.

186
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,433
Prepare for takeoff, Lieutenant Trouble.

187
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,726
<i>Charming memory.</i>

188
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:17,894
<i>Hang on.</i>

189
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,437
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

190
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,568
Goose likes you.

191
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,112
She doesn't typically take to people.

192
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,613
Early start to your morning.

193
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,906
Late night, actually.

194
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,991
I can't sleep when there's work to do.

195
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,159
Sound familiar?

196
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,828
Flying your planes never feels like work.

197
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,789
Wonderful view, isn't it?

198
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,833
I prefer the view from up there.

199
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,126
You'll get there soon enough, Ace.

200
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,378
<i>Wait! Wait, wait! That's her.
Get her back.</i>

201
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,171
<i>Stand by.</i>

202
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,010
Sound familiar?

203
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,678
Wonderful view, isn't it?

204
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,557
I prefer the view from up there.

205
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:56,850
You'll get there soon enough, Ace.

206
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,394
<i>What's that on her shirt?
I couldn't read it.</i>

207
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,772
Wonderful view, isn't it?

208
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,110
I prefer the view from up there.

209
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,030
<i>-Focus.</i>
-Excuse me?

210
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,865
<i>Look down.</i>

211
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,908
<i>Focus.</i>

212
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,745
<i>"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson."
That's her.</i>

213
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:17,912
Do you hear that, too?

214
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,414
<i>Do we have her location?</i>

215
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,542
<i>Got it.</i>

216
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,503
<i>Now track Lawson
until we find the energy signature.</i>

217
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,426
<i>Interesting.</i>

218
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,013
<i>Hold on.</i>

219
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,308
<i>Go back right before this.
Go back.</i>

220
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,603
That's no MiG, Lawson.

221
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,105
<i>This is it.
Now let me see where you're headed.</i>

222
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,775
<i>That's right.
Look at the coordinates.</i>

223
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,860
<i>Focus.</i>

224
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,030
<i>Open, please.</i>

225
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,698
<i>That's it. That's it.</i>

226
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,785
<i>You're almost there. You're almost there.
Don't fight it.</i>

227
00:17:58,453 --> 00:17:59,704
<i>Focus!</i>

228
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,124
<i>Get her back!
Get her back now!</i>

229
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,047
This doesn't make any sense.

230
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,649
Do we have any information
we can act on?

231
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,027
Just that Lawson was somewhere
on planet C-53.

232
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,195
We're on our way.

233
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,114
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

234
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:38,410
Lawson is our link
to that light-speed engine!

235
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,037
And everything we're after.

236
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:51,923
That did something.

237
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,383
Try that again.

238
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,979
Not yet!

239
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:16,948
What did you do to me?

240
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,492
Now we're just after a little information.

241
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,119
What did you put in my head?

242
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,163
Nothing that wasn't already there.

243
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,124
But those aren't my memories.

244
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,793
Yeah, it's like a bad trip, isn't it?

245
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,171
I'm not surprised you can't keep it straight.

246
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,423
They really did a number on you.

247
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,632
Enough of your mind games.

248
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,301
What do you want?

249
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,847
We're looking for the location
of a Dr. Lawson...

250
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,557
and her light-speed engine.

251
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,392
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

252
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,104
Really?
Then why is she in your head?

253
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,221
You guys wouldn't happen to know
how these things come off, would ya?

254
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:22,847
No?

255
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,265
Fine.

256
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,067
Hey.

257
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:03,656
<i>You do know why they call it a...</i>

258
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:22,967
You leaving so soon?

259
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,387
We're just getting to know each other.

260
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:51,848
Vers to Starforce command,
do you read me?

261
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,686
Hello? Do you copy?

262
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,051
Hi. I'm Vers. Kree Starforce.

263
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,386
Is this C-53?

264
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,516
Do you understand me?
Is my universal translator working?

265
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:36,685
Yeah. I understand you.

266
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:38,186
Oh, good.

267
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:40,146
Are you in charge of security
for this district?

268
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,734
Sort of.
The movie theater has its own guy.

269
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:48,071
Where can I find communications equipment?

270
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:56,329
Thank you.

271
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,364
Track the pod. Find the girl.

272
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,909
She knows more than she knows.

273
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:38,329
Hey.

274
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:40,957
This one's taken.

275
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:52,761
Come on.

276
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,346
<i>Vers?</i>

277
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:55,597
Vers?

278
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:58,266
Verify. CTC-39.

279
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,601
<i>GRXV-1600.</i>

280
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:00,977
<i>And I'm fine,
thank you for asking.</i>

281
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,480
<i>Is everyone okay?
What happened?</i>

282
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,440
Skrull ambush.

283
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,192
I thought we'd lost you.

284
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,360
Did you find Soh-Larr?

285
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:09,736
<i>It wasn't Soh-Larr.</i>

286
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:11,821
<i>Talos simmed him. Even knew his code.</i>

287
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,115
That's impossible.

288
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,117
That code was buried in his unconscious.

289
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,577
The Skrulls messed with my mind.

290
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:18,745
The machine that they used...

291
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,789
I think it's how they extracted
Soh-Larr's code.

292
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,374
Vers, where are you?

293
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,000
<i>I'm on planet C-53.</i>

294
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:27,128
The Skrulls are looking for
someone named Lawson.

295
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:28,630
<i>Who?</i>

296
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:31,925
She's who I see.

297
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,718
<i>She's what?</i>

298
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:35,720
<i>Vers?</i>

299
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:37,806
Vers, what?

300
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,433
She's a scientist.

301
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,435
They think that she's cracked the code
on light-speed tech.

302
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:44,187
I have to get to her before they do...

303
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,814
<i>or else they'll be able
to invade new galaxies.</i>

304
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,732
No. You've been caught once already.

305
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:50,485
How far is C-53?

306
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:53,655
Closest jump point is 22 hours.

307
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:55,824
<i>Vers, hold your position
until we get there.</i>

308
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,909
<i>Keep your comms online
so we can contact you.</i>

309
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,953
No! What if they get a hold of it before...?

310
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,995
<i>We're sorry.</i>

311
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,206
<i>A long-distance company access code
is required for the number you have dialed.</i>

312
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:04,958
-Yon-Rogg?
-Vers?

313
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:07,419
Vers?

314
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:08,878
<i>Please dial your call with the access code.</i>

315
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,046
Vers?

316
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,800
If the Skrulls got to her,
she's compromised.

317
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,969
She's stronger than you think.

318
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,763
Ever been to C-53?

319
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:20,515
Once.

320
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,393
It's a real shithole.

321
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:36,781
Hey, rookie! Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

322
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,415
Did you call this in?

323
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,097
<i>Beacon activated.</i>

324
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,894
Excuse me, miss.

325
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,438
You know anything
about a lady blowing a hole...

326
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:11,775
through the roof of that Blockbuster
over there?

327
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:14,569
Witness says she was dressed for laser tag.

328
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,407
Yeah, I think she went that way.

329
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,119
I'd like to ask you some questions.

330
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:27,290
Maybe give you the 411
on the late-night drop box.

331
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,459
Could I see some identification, please?

332
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,419
Vers. Kree Starforce.

333
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:33,505
We don't carry our identification
on little cards.

334
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:34,673
Vers?

335
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:37,300
Starforce?

336
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,095
How long you plan to be in town?

337
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,304
I'll be out of your hair...

338
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:44,516
as soon as I track down the Skrulls
that are infiltrating your planet.

339
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:46,726
Skrulls?

340
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:48,311
Shapeshifters?

341
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,523
They can transform into any life-form
down to the DNA.

342
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:54,651
Oh, boy. You guys don't have any clue,
do you?

343
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,028
Hold on.

344
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:03,284
How do we know
you're not one of those shapeshifters?

345
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:05,245
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

346
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:07,330
You have finally asked a relevant question.

347
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:10,458
No! Congratulations to you, Starforce lady.

348
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,711
You're under arrest.

349
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:21,761
Rook!

350
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:23,888
Rook, let's roll!

351
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:34,733
Did you see her weapon?

352
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:36,067
I did not.

353
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,120
Watch it!

354
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:22,113
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

355
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:45,929
"Trust me, true believer."
"Trust me."

356
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,103
"Trust me, true believer."

357
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:40,233
Get off!

358
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:37,707
Train's heading for a tunnel up ahead.

359
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,712
Let's greet them at the station.

360
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:56,267
<i>Mr. Fury, this is Agent Coulson.</i>

361
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:59,312
I'm still here at the Blockbuster.

362
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:02,649
Where'd everybody go?

363
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:05,193
<i>I finished collecting evidence...</i>

364
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:34,657
We need an ambulance!

365
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:35,992
Someone call 911!

366
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,660
Hey! You all right?

367
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,662
Oh, my gosh! Is everyone okay?

368
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:40,830
Anyone else see that?

369
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:43,917
Official S.H.I.E.L.D. activity.
Stay back.

370
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:34,300
Nice scuba suit.

371
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,641
Lighten up, honey, huh?

372
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,643
Got a smile for me?

373
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:49,065
Freak.

374
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,838
All life on Earth is carbon-based.
Not this guy.

375
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:16,009
Whatever he runs on,
it's not on the periodic table.

376
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:18,762
You're saying he's not from around here?

377
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:20,847
Hey, how's your eye?

378
00:36:21,848 --> 00:36:24,017
Well, I'd say fine...

379
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,603
but it can't believe what it's seeing.

380
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:34,319
You say this thing looked like Coulson?

381
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,279
Talked like him, too.

382
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:39,157
And the woman said that there were more?

383
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,242
The word she used was "infiltration."

384
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:42,452
You believe her?

385
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:44,162
Not till I saw this.

386
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,457
What's your plan?

387
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:49,876
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

388
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:53,630
I got word on a motorcycle thief
that fits her description.

389
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,508
If she can tell us
why these lizards are here...

390
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:59,260
maybe she can tell us
how to kick 'em to the curb.

391
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:00,428
Good.

392
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:04,224
Do it alone, though.
We can't trust anyone.

393
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,352
Not even our own men.

394
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,770
Yes, sir.

395
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:25,995
Wow. They're ugly bastards, aren't they?

396
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:29,958
Yeah, well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.

397
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:37,257
Safe journey to the beyond, my friend.

398
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:42,095
I will finish what we started.

399
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:52,689
I wouldn't get too close there, boss.

400
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,443
No one in or out.

401
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:33,229
Boom!

402
00:38:58,546 --> 00:38:59,631
What can I get ya?

403
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,549
Where was this photograph taken?

404
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:03,593
An airport.

405
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,011
Where's Pegasus?

406
00:39:05,178 --> 00:39:06,763
That's classified.

407
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:10,475
Not unlike the file I started on you.

408
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,688
But I see you've changed it up
a bit since then.

409
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:16,481
Grunge is a good look for you.

410
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:18,149
Did you have a rough day, Agent Fury?

411
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:19,776
It was cool, you know?

412
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:22,737
Had a space invasion, big car chase.

413
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:26,366
Got to watch an alien autopsy.

414
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,410
Typical nine-to-five.

415
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:29,577
So you saw one?

416
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:32,497
I was never one to believe in aliens...

417
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:35,417
but I can't unsee that.

418
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,211
This is gonna get a little awkward,
but I gotta ask.

419
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,672
You think I'm one of those green things.

420
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,132
Can't be too careful.

421
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:47,095
You are looking at
100% red-blooded Earth man.

422
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:48,513
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

423
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,640
We talking cheek swab or urine sample?

424
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,559
No. The DNA would match.

425
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:53,810
Want my AOL password?

426
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:57,272
Skrulls can only sim
recent memories of their host bodies.

427
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,734
You wanna get personal.

428
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:02,861
-Where were you born?
-Huntsville, Alabama.

429
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:04,404
But technically, I don't remember that part.

430
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:05,989
-Name of your first pet?
-Mr. Snoofers.

431
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,450
-Mr. Snoofers?
-That's what I said. Do I pass?

432
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:09,951
Not yet. First job?

433
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:13,121
Soldier. Straight out of high school.
Left the ranks a full bird colonel.

434
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:14,330
-Then?
-Spy.

435
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:16,791
-Where?
-It was the Cold War. We were everywhere.

436
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:19,627
Belfast. Bucharest. Belgrade. Budapest.

437
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:21,296
I like the B's. I can make them rhyme.

438
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:23,673
-Now?
-Been riding a desk for the past six years...

439
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,842
trying to figure out where our
future enemies are coming from.

440
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:29,512
Never occurred to me
they would be coming from above.

441
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:32,390
Name a detail so bizarre
a Skrull could never fabricate it.

442
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:38,480
If toast is cut diagonally,
I can't eat it.

443
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:41,858
You didn't need that, did you?

444
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:43,693
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.

445
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,945
Okay. Your turn.

446
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:47,781
Prove you're not a Skrull.

447
00:40:56,373 --> 00:41:00,210
And how is that supposed to prove to me
you're not a Skrull?

448
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:01,628
That's a photon blast.

449
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,088
And?

450
00:41:03,254 --> 00:41:04,172
A Skrull can't do that.

451
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:07,675
So, a full bird colonel turned spy
turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...

452
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:10,303
must have pretty high security clearance.

453
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:11,930
Where's Pegasus?

454
00:41:17,602 --> 00:41:22,357
Okay. The Skrulls sim alien races
to infiltrate and take over planets.

455
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:26,569
And you're a Kree?
A race of noble warriors?

456
00:41:26,736 --> 00:41:29,239
Heroes. Noble warrior heroes.

457
00:41:29,406 --> 00:41:32,992
So, what do Skrulls want with Dr. Lawson?

458
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:38,039
They believe that she developed
a light-speed engine at Pegasus.

459
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:39,749
Light-speed engine?

460
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:43,545
Gotta admit, that's not the craziest thing
I've heard today.

461
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:45,296
Well, it's still early.

462
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:47,382
And you, what do you want?

463
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:49,884
To stop the Skrulls
before they become unstoppable.

464
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:50,885
And?

465
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:58,393
Look, war is a universal language.

466
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,271
I know a rogue soldier when I see one.

467
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:03,690
You got a personal stake in this.

468
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:17,412
<i>This is government property.
Turn your vehicle around.</i>

469
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,623
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

470
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,959
<i>Place your thumb on the pad.</i>

471
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:25,295
<i>One moment.</i>

472
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:29,424
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
You have three names?

473
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:31,551
Everybody calls me Fury.

474
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:35,597
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph. Not Nick.
Just Fury.

475
00:42:35,764 --> 00:42:37,182
-What does your mom call you?
-Fury.

476
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:38,850
-What do you call her?
-Fury.

477
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:40,060
What about your kids?

478
00:42:40,226 --> 00:42:41,978
If I have them, they'll call me Fury.

479
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:43,355
<i>You are cleared for access.</i>

480
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:44,397
Thank you.

481
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:15,679
Hold up.

482
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:18,890
You look like somebody's disaffected niece.

483
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:21,893
Put that on.

484
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:25,313
-What is it?
-It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.

485
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,734
Does announcing your identity on clothing
help with the covert part of your job?

486
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:32,153
Said the space soldier
who was wearing a rubber suit.

487
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:34,406
Lose the flannel.

488
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,835
How can I help you?

489
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:49,546
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

490
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:53,925
We're looking for a woman named Lawson.

491
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:56,344
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

492
00:43:57,887 --> 00:43:59,389
Do you know her?

493
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:04,936
Follow me.

494
00:44:09,315 --> 00:44:12,569
You familiar with the phrase "welcome wagon"?

495
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:14,571
No.

496
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:18,158
Well, this ain't it.

497
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:26,541
Is that a communicator?

498
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:30,003
Yeah. State-of-the-art two-way pager.

499
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,254
Who are you paging?

500
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:35,091
My mom. Don't worry.
I didn't mention you.

501
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:14,714
After you.

502
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:16,508
Impressive.

503
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:19,427
You should see
what I can do with a paperclip.

504
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:32,357
Hey, there. How are you?

505
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:37,028
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.
Just look at you.

506
00:45:37,195 --> 00:45:39,572
Aren't you the cutest little thing?

507
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:43,034
Aren't you cute? And what's your name?
What's your name?

508
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:45,995
"Goose." Cool name for a cool cat.

509
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:46,996
Fury?

510
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:51,876
I'll be back.

511
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,340
Let me get my fingerprint out.

512
00:45:57,507 --> 00:45:58,967
Just let me unravel this puppy.

513
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:05,598
You sat there and watched me
play with tape?

514
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:06,766
When all you had to do was...

515
00:46:06,933 --> 00:46:08,435
I didn't wanna steal your thunder.

516
00:46:26,494 --> 00:46:27,620
Lawson.

517
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:40,800
Lawson's plan for the light-speed engine.

518
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:43,595
I wonder why they terminated the project.

519
00:46:45,263 --> 00:46:48,725
Maybe because she's cuckoo.

520
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:52,479
Kree glyphs?

521
00:46:55,357 --> 00:46:56,983
Lawson is not cuckoo.

522
00:46:59,277 --> 00:47:00,945
She's Kree.

523
00:47:01,112 --> 00:47:03,531
Well, she's dead.

524
00:47:03,698 --> 00:47:05,158
What?

525
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:08,953
She crashed the Asis aircraft
doing an unauthorized test flight.

526
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,122
Took a pilot down with her.

527
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:13,458
That's why security here is so unfriendly.

528
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,670
They're covering up a billion-dollar mistake.

529
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:20,965
And your light-speed engine is toast.

530
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,012
When did this crash happen?

531
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:29,849
Six years ago. 1989.

532
00:47:31,017 --> 00:47:32,435
Who was the pilot?

533
00:47:33,728 --> 00:47:36,439
Most of this thing's redacted...

534
00:47:36,606 --> 00:47:40,777
but there is a testimonial here
from a Maria Rambeau.

535
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:43,029
Last person to see them alive.

536
00:47:48,326 --> 00:47:49,494
You okay?

537
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:52,455
Mm-hmm.

538
00:47:53,998 --> 00:47:55,333
Back in a minute.

539
00:48:25,363 --> 00:48:27,282
This isn't about fighting wars.

540
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:29,200
It's about ending them.

541
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,750
<i>I know Lawson was Kree.</i>

542
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:39,836
She was here on C-53
and died in a plane crash.

543
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:42,630
<i>Do you know anything about this?</i>

544
00:48:42,797 --> 00:48:46,134
I just discovered a mission report
sent from C-53.

545
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:50,055
There's only so much
I'm cleared to tell you, Vers, but...

546
00:48:53,808 --> 00:48:57,896
<i>Lawson was an undercover
Kree operative named Mar-Vell.</i>

547
00:48:58,063 --> 00:49:01,649
She was working on a unique energy core.

548
00:49:01,816 --> 00:49:06,029
Experimenting with tech that apparently
could help us win the war.

549
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:14,037
She still here?

550
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:16,664
She's cooperating
with the investigation, sir.

551
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:18,792
-You men stay here.
-Yes, sir.

552
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:20,835
I want to question her alone.

553
00:49:22,504 --> 00:49:24,798
Excellent work, Nicholas.

554
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,345
Does it say anything about me?

555
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:32,180
Anything about you?
No, of course not.

556
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:33,348
<i>Why would it?</i>

557
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:36,643
I found evidence that I had a life here.

558
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,436
<i>On C-53?</i>

559
00:49:40,855 --> 00:49:43,692
Mar-Vell is who I see
when I visit the Supreme Intelligence.

560
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:47,028
I knew her. And I knew her as Lawson.

561
00:49:47,195 --> 00:49:49,447
This sounds like Skrull simulation, Vers.

562
00:49:49,614 --> 00:49:51,408
No, it's not. Because I remember.
I was here.

563
00:49:51,574 --> 00:49:53,326
<i>Stop. Remember your training.</i>

564
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:55,745
Know your enemy.
It could be you.

565
00:49:55,912 --> 00:49:59,249
<i>Do not let your emotions
override your judgment.</i>

566
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:02,419
She's on sublevel six.

567
00:50:02,585 --> 00:50:03,962
I'll get off on five...

568
00:50:04,129 --> 00:50:06,256
and take the stairs
in case she makes a run for it.

569
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,343
Do a pincer move like we did in Havana.

570
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:13,471
Right. Like we did in Havana.

571
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:27,235
<i>We're nearing the jump point.
Leave your beacon on so I can find you.</i>

572
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:30,155
We'll get to the bottom of this, Vers.

573
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:31,948
Together.

574
00:50:34,492 --> 00:50:35,827
Okay.

575
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:55,013
Vers!

576
00:50:56,723 --> 00:50:57,974
Vers!

577
00:51:14,824 --> 00:51:16,451
Fury's colluding with the target.

578
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:17,869
Then why would he call us in?

579
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:20,497
All I know is we take him in, too.
Dead or alive.

580
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:21,956
Dead or alive?

581
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:38,098
Go. Go, go!

582
00:51:50,568 --> 00:51:52,696
Was it something I said?

583
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:35,238
Now, you know,
I don't really need these to see...

584
00:52:35,864 --> 00:52:39,868
but they do kinda complete the look.

585
00:52:40,535 --> 00:52:41,828
Don't you think?

586
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:00,347
You called them in?

587
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:01,931
My bad.

588
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:17,989
Coulson, do you have eyes on them?

589
00:53:18,156 --> 00:53:19,824
They're not down here.

590
00:53:21,242 --> 00:53:22,285
Let's try up there.

591
00:53:31,544 --> 00:53:32,796
-What?
-Your communicator.

592
00:53:32,962 --> 00:53:34,714
You obviously can't be trusted with it.

593
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,247
Do you know how to fly this thing?

594
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:08,415
We'll see.

595
00:54:08,581 --> 00:54:10,083
That's a yes or no question.

596
00:54:14,295 --> 00:54:15,130
Yes.

597
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,260
That's what I'm talking about!

598
00:54:47,537 --> 00:54:48,788
We got a stowaway.

599
00:54:52,917 --> 00:54:54,002
Hang on, Goose.

600
00:54:59,382 --> 00:55:00,216
Goose.

601
00:55:03,428 --> 00:55:04,429
No, Goose.

602
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:08,933
Who's a good kitty, huh?
Huh, Goose?

603
00:55:09,392 --> 00:55:11,061
Yes, that's right.

604
00:55:11,227 --> 00:55:13,063
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

605
00:55:13,438 --> 00:55:15,982
-You the good kitty, that's right.
-See anyone you know?

606
00:55:17,817 --> 00:55:19,235
Funny story.

607
00:55:19,402 --> 00:55:23,073
I arrived on Hala near dead.
No memory.

608
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:25,033
That was six years ago.

609
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,661
So, you think you're the pilot
that went down with Dr. Lawson?

610
00:55:28,828 --> 00:55:32,290
I'm saying the last person to see them alive
could probably tell us.

611
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:34,042
-Maria Rambeau?
-Mm-hmm.

612
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:35,960
So, how do we get to Louisiana?

613
00:55:36,836 --> 00:55:39,422
Due east.
Hang a right at Memphis.

614
00:55:40,965 --> 00:55:42,842
That agent...

615
00:55:43,009 --> 00:55:44,928
that stopped the Skrulls
from finding us?

616
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:47,013
Coulson. The new guy.

617
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,431
I guess he doesn't hate me yet.

618
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:50,350
Yeah, well, give him time.

619
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:53,978
I guess he had a feeling, you know?

620
00:55:54,145 --> 00:55:56,314
Went with his gut against orders.

621
00:55:56,481 --> 00:55:57,816
That's a really hard thing to do.

622
00:55:57,982 --> 00:55:59,901
But it's what keeps us human.

623
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:02,404
I get in trouble for that. A lot.

624
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:03,655
I can see that about you.

625
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:08,993
Rescuing the guy
who sold you out to the Skrulls?

626
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,038
I'm guessing that's not standard
Kree operating procedure.

627
00:56:12,205 --> 00:56:14,374
Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.

628
00:56:22,632 --> 00:56:23,633
Ronan.

629
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,677
<i>The Accusers completed
their operation...</i>

630
00:56:25,844 --> 00:56:28,430
<i>but the greater mission was a failure,
thanks to your team.</i>

631
00:56:28,596 --> 00:56:32,809
It was a trap to lure our operative Vers
to Torfa and kidnap her.

632
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:35,770
<i>Give us their location.
We'll take care of the terrorist threat.</i>

633
00:56:35,937 --> 00:56:38,231
By bombing them out of the galaxy?

634
00:56:38,898 --> 00:56:40,942
No, we'll handle this.

635
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:45,238
<i>A cell of Skrulls anywhere
is a threat to Kree everywhere.</i>

636
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:46,364
<i>Where are they?</i>

637
00:56:46,531 --> 00:56:48,241
-They are...
-Lost.

638
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:51,619
They are lost for now.

639
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:53,413
But we will find them.

640
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:57,125
<i>Do so, or we will.</i>

641
00:57:01,254 --> 00:57:03,673
Maintain the course for C-53.

642
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:25,153
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

643
00:57:27,322 --> 00:57:28,615
Auntie Carol?

644
00:57:28,782 --> 00:57:30,700
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

645
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:34,454
I knew it! Everyone said you were dead!

646
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:36,706
But we knew they were lying.

647
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,919
I'm not really who you think I am.

648
00:57:50,136 --> 00:57:52,097
That is the craziest shit I ever heard.

649
00:57:52,263 --> 00:57:55,266
Green transforming aliens?
There's no such thing.

650
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:58,561
You are absolutely right, young lady.
There is no such thing.

651
00:57:58,728 --> 00:58:02,649
'Cause if there were,
we would want to keep that to ourselves.

652
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:03,900
You don't believe me?

653
00:58:11,908 --> 00:58:13,118
No way!

654
00:58:13,576 --> 00:58:15,495
That's so cool!

655
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:18,331
She can do a lot more than make tea
with those hands.

656
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:19,541
Like what? Show us.

657
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,000
Maybe later.

658
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:23,503
I kept all your stuff.

659
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:24,838
I'll go get it.

660
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,424
You want to give her a hand with that?

661
00:58:43,815 --> 00:58:45,734
You don't remember anything?

662
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:50,488
I see flashes.

663
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:53,033
Little moments.

664
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:55,535
But I can't tell what's real.

665
00:58:57,829 --> 00:59:01,124
If I could just piece together what happened
that morning...

666
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:03,960
maybe it'll all make sense.

667
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:10,300
You woke me up banging on my door at dawn.

668
00:59:10,467 --> 00:59:12,010
Your usual move.

669
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:15,180
Back then, we had to get up so early.

670
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,183
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

671
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:22,187
so testing Lawson's planes was our only shot
at doing something that mattered.

672
00:59:22,354 --> 00:59:25,106
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...

673
00:59:25,273 --> 00:59:28,109
and I wasn't about to argue,
'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate.

674
00:59:28,276 --> 00:59:30,403
But you cheated, took a shortcut.

675
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:32,113
Since when is a shortcut cheating?

676
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,366
Since it violates the predetermined rules
of engagement.

677
00:59:34,532 --> 00:59:35,742
I definitely don't remember those.

678
00:59:36,284 --> 00:59:37,535
Of course you don't.

679
00:59:42,415 --> 00:59:47,712
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

680
00:59:47,879 --> 00:59:50,924
She said she had lives to save.

681
00:59:51,883 --> 00:59:54,427
She was trying to take the Asis up herself,
but you said that...

682
00:59:54,594 --> 00:59:58,139
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.

683
00:59:58,306 --> 01:00:02,560
Yeah. Yep. Big hero moment.

684
01:00:03,144 --> 01:00:06,147
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

685
01:00:07,065 --> 01:00:10,652
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

686
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:15,490
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

687
01:00:17,242 --> 01:00:18,743
I know this must be hard for you.

688
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,870
Oh, what? This part right here?

689
01:00:21,621 --> 01:00:23,998
No. No.

690
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:30,797
What's hard is losing my best friend...

691
01:00:31,297 --> 01:00:34,801
in a mission so secret
they act like it never even happened.

692
01:00:36,928 --> 01:00:42,350
Hard is knowing you were out there somewhere
too damn stubborn to die.

693
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:46,438
And now you come up in here
after six years...

694
01:00:46,604 --> 01:00:48,481
with your supercharged fire hands...

695
01:00:48,648 --> 01:00:50,025
and you expect me to call you...

696
01:00:50,775 --> 01:00:52,444
I don't even know what. Vers?

697
01:00:54,195 --> 01:00:56,156
Is that really who you are now?

698
01:00:58,533 --> 01:01:00,201
I don't know.

699
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,833
Come look!

700
01:01:13,256 --> 01:01:14,841
This is me and you on Halloween.

701
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:18,303
I'm Amelia Earhart
and you're Janis Joplin.

702
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:19,971
This is you when you were little.

703
01:01:20,138 --> 01:01:21,931
You didn't get along with your parents...

704
01:01:22,098 --> 01:01:23,641
so Mom said we became your real family.

705
01:01:23,808 --> 01:01:25,352
This is us on Christmas.

706
01:01:25,518 --> 01:01:26,686
I got my favorite bunny slippers.

707
01:01:26,853 --> 01:01:28,438
This is another picture of you
when you were little.

708
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:29,606
You've always wanted to be a pilot.

709
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:30,774
And this is right after you graduated.

710
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,442
This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...

711
01:01:32,609 --> 01:01:34,277
This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.

712
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,863
And this is you with Mom
right after a good day of training.

713
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,323
These were your three favorite guys.

714
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:41,910
Oh, wait. I forgot.

715
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:43,536
Your jacket.

716
01:01:43,703 --> 01:01:46,748
Mom doesn't let me wear it anymore
after I spilled ketchup on it.

717
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:02,389
That was all that survived the crash.

718
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:05,350
Or so we thought.

719
01:02:09,854 --> 01:02:11,731
Don't answer that.

720
01:02:11,898 --> 01:02:13,525
It's just my neighbor.

721
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:15,360
They can change into anyone.

722
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:21,700
Hi there.

723
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:23,076
What do you want?

724
01:02:24,953 --> 01:02:27,831
Hey, Tom. This is my friend, Carol.

725
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:29,249
Pleased to meet you.

726
01:02:32,711 --> 01:02:35,004
Static electricity out here's no joke.

727
01:02:35,755 --> 01:02:38,466
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

728
01:02:38,633 --> 01:02:39,634
and I was just wondering...

729
01:02:39,801 --> 01:02:42,095
if you mind if I bring the boys over
to get a closer look-see?

730
01:02:42,262 --> 01:02:44,514
-A closer look-see?
-Yeah.

731
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:47,809
To see the "bird" parked out by the road?

732
01:02:49,227 --> 01:02:53,231
You're really working overtime
to sell this one, aren't you, Talos?

733
01:02:54,232 --> 01:02:56,818
I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.

734
01:02:56,985 --> 01:02:58,403
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

735
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,613
Okay.

736
01:03:02,824 --> 01:03:06,161
You know, you really should be kinder
to your neighbors.

737
01:03:06,786 --> 01:03:09,706
You never know when you're gonna need to
borrow some sugar.

738
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,586
Now, hang on a second.

739
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:18,214
Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...

740
01:03:18,381 --> 01:03:21,343
making a mess of your friend's house...

741
01:03:22,093 --> 01:03:23,386
It's a lovely home, miss.

742
01:03:23,553 --> 01:03:24,721
Oh, my God!

743
01:03:25,263 --> 01:03:26,806
What the hell?

744
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,020
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

745
01:03:32,687 --> 01:03:35,065
Just don't kill me.

746
01:03:35,231 --> 01:03:37,025
That would really complicate the situation.

747
01:03:37,192 --> 01:03:41,237
I'm about five seconds from complicating
that wall with some ugly-ass Skrull brains.

748
01:03:41,404 --> 01:03:42,947
I'm sorry I simmed your boss.

749
01:03:43,114 --> 01:03:47,952
But now I stand before you as my true self.
Without deception.

750
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:49,412
And who is that out there?

751
01:03:50,288 --> 01:03:52,624
Okay, that's a fair point...

752
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:56,711
but I'm sure that you understand
I had to take some precautions.

753
01:03:56,878 --> 01:04:01,174
I saw you crush 20 of my best men
with your hands bound.

754
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:02,467
I just wanna talk.

755
01:04:02,634 --> 01:04:04,844
Last time we talked, I ended up
hanging from my ankles.

756
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:07,472
That was before I knew who you were.

757
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:10,767
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

758
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:13,937
I have an audio recording
from Pegasus...

759
01:04:14,104 --> 01:04:18,566
of your voice from a plane crash
six years ago...

760
01:04:18,733 --> 01:04:22,946
on a device I believe you call
a "black box."

761
01:04:23,488 --> 01:04:27,242
They told me it was destroyed in the crash.
How'd you get it?

762
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:28,410
She don't understand.

763
01:04:28,576 --> 01:04:29,869
Young lady, I have a special skill...

764
01:04:30,036 --> 01:04:33,623
that kind of allows me to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.

765
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:34,833
Call me "young lady" again...

766
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,794
I'm gonna put my foot in a place
it's not supposed to be.

767
01:04:39,879 --> 01:04:42,215
Am I supposed to guess where that is?

768
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:43,967
Your ass.

769
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:46,594
Okay, I get it.
We're all a little on edge here.

770
01:04:46,761 --> 01:04:49,931
But, look, I just need your help
decoding some coordinates.

771
01:04:50,098 --> 01:04:51,933
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

772
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:55,270
I assure you, it'll be worth your while.

773
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:00,191
Call your buddy back inside and I'll listen.

774
01:05:00,817 --> 01:05:01,818
Deal.

775
01:05:03,028 --> 01:05:04,904
Oh, my God! Get that thing away.

776
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:06,406
How'd that get in here?

777
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:09,951
The cat?

778
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:11,286
This isn't what you're afraid of, is it?

779
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:12,871
That's not a cat.

780
01:05:13,913 --> 01:05:16,041
-That's a Flerken.
-A Flerken?

781
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:17,751
Mom?

782
01:05:25,258 --> 01:05:26,259
Monica.

783
01:05:26,426 --> 01:05:27,677
Why can't I listen, too?

784
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:57,207
What's happening?

785
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:58,958
It's loading.

786
01:06:02,796 --> 01:06:08,551
<i>Punch in the coordinates
5-2-2-9, negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.</i>

787
01:06:08,718 --> 01:06:10,679
<i>Copy that. Where are we going, Doc?</i>

788
01:06:10,845 --> 01:06:12,222
<i>My laboratory.</i>

789
01:06:12,389 --> 01:06:14,599
<i>Your laboratory?
What do you mean?</i>

790
01:06:14,766 --> 01:06:15,892
<i>Oh, no.</i>

791
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:19,562
<i>Is that...? Wait, what is that?
It's not showing up on my radar.</i>

792
01:06:19,729 --> 01:06:21,272
<i>Go, Carol. Fly!</i>

793
01:06:21,606 --> 01:06:23,858
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

794
01:06:24,025 --> 01:06:26,027
Those are the bad guys. Fly faster now!

795
01:06:26,194 --> 01:06:27,070
Yes, ma'am.

796
01:06:33,243 --> 01:06:35,370
-What do they want?
-Me. My work.

797
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:37,080
I never should have brought you along.

798
01:06:42,252 --> 01:06:43,253
Here come some G's.

799
01:07:02,814 --> 01:07:04,524
They're firing backwards. Hold on!

800
01:07:15,952 --> 01:07:17,203
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

801
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:22,250
Stay with me, Lawson!

802
01:07:40,518 --> 01:07:41,853
<i>Carol, come in. Do you copy?</i>

803
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:44,439
Yeah, I copy. We hit ground.

804
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:46,149
<i>Carol, are you okay? Do you copy?</i>

805
01:07:46,316 --> 01:07:48,485
Yeah! I copy.

806
01:07:51,237 --> 01:07:52,238
Doc?

807
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:54,699
Your blood.

808
01:07:56,117 --> 01:07:57,160
It's blue.

809
01:07:57,327 --> 01:08:00,538
Yeah, but how's my hair?

810
01:08:01,998 --> 01:08:04,376
Help me out, will ya?

811
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:10,465
I gotta destroy it before they get here.

812
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:11,716
Lawson?

813
01:08:12,133 --> 01:08:15,887
You remember what I said
about our work here? What it's for?

814
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,139
To end wars?

815
01:08:18,306 --> 01:08:21,935
Yeah. But the wars are bigger than you know.

816
01:08:23,144 --> 01:08:24,604
Damn it!

817
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:27,190
My name is not Lawson.

818
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:33,571
My real name is Mar-Vell,
and I come from a planet called Hala.

819
01:08:34,906 --> 01:08:36,950
I would say that you're delusional...

820
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:40,328
but we just got shot down by a spaceship
and your blood is blue.

821
01:08:41,204 --> 01:08:45,041
Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

822
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:48,336
Now, skedaddle before you give me
any more regrets.

823
01:08:48,503 --> 01:08:50,588
Just remember the coordinates, okay?

824
01:08:51,172 --> 01:08:52,757
You gotta save 'em without me.

825
01:08:52,924 --> 01:08:53,967
Save who? How?

826
01:08:54,134 --> 01:08:57,012
Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

827
01:08:57,178 --> 01:08:58,471
What are you doing?

828
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:20,493
We have no interest in hurting you.

829
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:22,245
No?

830
01:09:22,412 --> 01:09:25,081
'Cause all the shooting
kinda gave me the wrong impression!

831
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:28,043
The energy core.

832
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:30,128
Where is it?

833
01:09:30,295 --> 01:09:32,005
Pararescue's on the way.

834
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:34,716
You have two minutes until you're surrounded.

835
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:37,677
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

836
01:09:37,844 --> 01:09:38,887
No, wait!

837
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:46,686
You mean that energy core?

838
01:09:51,232 --> 01:09:52,359
No!

839
01:10:35,985 --> 01:10:39,364
Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

840
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:40,532
Hold your fire.

841
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:52,419
There's nothing left.

842
01:10:52,585 --> 01:10:54,254
The core has been destroyed.

843
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:05,849
She absorbed its power.

844
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:09,894
She's coming with us.

845
01:11:30,749 --> 01:11:32,125
He lied to me.

846
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:36,713
Everything that I knew was a lie.

847
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,382
Now, you understand.

848
01:11:39,549 --> 01:11:42,052
What? What do I understand now?

849
01:11:42,218 --> 01:11:44,095
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

850
01:11:44,262 --> 01:11:45,388
He killed her...

851
01:11:46,264 --> 01:11:51,519
'cause she found out that she was
on the wrong side of an unjust war.

852
01:11:51,686 --> 01:11:52,520
No.

853
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:55,190
Your people are terrorists.

854
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:56,858
They kill innocents.

855
01:11:57,025 --> 01:11:58,777
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

856
01:11:58,943 --> 01:12:02,197
Ruins that the Accusers are responsible for.

857
01:12:02,572 --> 01:12:05,867
My people lived as refugees on Torfa.

858
01:12:06,659 --> 01:12:09,621
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

859
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:11,790
and they destroyed our planet.

860
01:12:11,956 --> 01:12:17,671
And the handful of us that are left
will be slaughtered next...

861
01:12:17,837 --> 01:12:21,841
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

862
01:12:23,134 --> 01:12:26,179
The core that she found
would have powered a light-speed ship...

863
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:28,139
capable of carrying us to safety.

864
01:12:28,306 --> 01:12:32,268
A new home where the Kree can't reach us.

865
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:37,440
Lawson always told us that our work
at Pegasus wasn't to fight wars...

866
01:12:37,607 --> 01:12:38,608
but to end them.

867
01:12:39,234 --> 01:12:44,781
She wanted you to help us find the core.

868
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:46,825
Well, I already destroyed it.

869
01:12:46,991 --> 01:12:48,535
No, you destroyed the engine.

870
01:12:48,702 --> 01:12:51,705
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

871
01:12:51,871 --> 01:12:56,167
If you help us decode those coordinates...

872
01:12:56,334 --> 01:12:57,877
we can find it.

873
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:01,297
You'll use it to destroy us.

874
01:13:04,926 --> 01:13:06,553
We just want a home.

875
01:13:10,765 --> 01:13:16,021
You and I lost everything at the hands
of the Kree.

876
01:13:16,187 --> 01:13:18,023
Can't you see it now?

877
01:13:18,189 --> 01:13:19,566
You're not one of them.

878
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:24,112
You don't know me.

879
01:13:25,488 --> 01:13:27,949
You have no idea who I am.

880
01:13:30,076 --> 01:13:32,328
I don't even know who I am!

881
01:13:33,621 --> 01:13:35,915
You are Carol Danvers.

882
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:41,921
You are the woman on that black box
risking her life to do the right thing.

883
01:13:43,715 --> 01:13:45,467
My best friend...

884
01:13:45,633 --> 01:13:50,096
who supported me as a mother and a pilot
when no one else did.

885
01:13:50,722 --> 01:13:55,810
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

886
01:13:55,977 --> 01:13:59,272
and you were the most powerful person
I knew...

887
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:02,525
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

888
01:14:03,234 --> 01:14:04,652
You hear me?

889
01:14:06,071 --> 01:14:07,864
Do you hear me?

890
01:14:15,121 --> 01:14:17,123
Come here. Come here, girl.

891
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,209
I got you.

892
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:26,466
<i>I know I don't deserve your trust...</i>

893
01:14:26,716 --> 01:14:28,843
but you were our only lead.

894
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:34,099
We discovered that your energy signature
matched Mar-Vell's core.

895
01:14:34,933 --> 01:14:36,768
Now we know why.

896
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:42,565
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

897
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:49,030
I just need your help decoding
the coordinates to Mar-Vell's lab.

898
01:14:49,739 --> 01:14:52,784
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

899
01:14:52,951 --> 01:14:54,869
For orbital position and velocity.

900
01:14:55,036 --> 01:14:58,081
You didn't find her lab on Earth,
'cause it's not on Earth.

901
01:14:58,248 --> 01:15:00,500
That was the location
on the date of the crash six years ago.

902
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:04,421
If we track its course,
we'll find it in orbit right now.

903
01:15:04,587 --> 01:15:06,297
It's just basic physics.

904
01:15:08,758 --> 01:15:09,759
In orbit?

905
01:15:11,678 --> 01:15:13,263
Was that so difficult to figure out?

906
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:15,640
I mean, you're my science guy, right?

907
01:15:16,349 --> 01:15:18,852
Yon-Rogg will catch up to me soon.

908
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:21,646
We've got to get to the core before he does.

909
01:15:21,813 --> 01:15:23,481
We're going to space?

910
01:15:23,648 --> 01:15:24,649
In what?

911
01:15:24,816 --> 01:15:26,443
A few tweaks to your vessel should do it.

912
01:15:26,609 --> 01:15:28,737
I can handle the modifications.

913
01:15:28,903 --> 01:15:30,572
Your science guy.

914
01:15:37,495 --> 01:15:39,039
Well, I could use a copilot.

915
01:15:40,373 --> 01:15:42,792
No. No, I can't.

916
01:15:42,959 --> 01:15:44,836
I can't leave Monica.

917
01:15:45,003 --> 01:15:47,797
Mom, it's okay.
I can stay with Gramma and Paw-paw.

918
01:15:48,381 --> 01:15:50,425
There's no way I'm going, baby.
It's too dangerous.

919
01:15:50,592 --> 01:15:52,510
Testing brand-new aerospace tech
is dangerous...

920
01:15:52,677 --> 01:15:53,720
and you used to do that.

921
01:15:55,513 --> 01:15:58,892
Your plan is to leave the atmosphere
in a craft not designed for the journey...

922
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:00,643
and you anticipate hostile encounters...

923
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:02,979
with a technologically-superior
foreign enemy.

924
01:16:03,521 --> 01:16:04,814
Correct?

925
01:16:04,981 --> 01:16:07,233
-That's what I'm saying. You have to go!
-Monica!

926
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,778
You have a chance to fly the coolest mission
in the history of missions...

927
01:16:09,944 --> 01:16:13,031
and you're gonna give it up to sit on
the couch and watch <i>Fresh Prince</i> with me?

928
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:14,741
What?

929
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:15,992
I just think you should consider...

930
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:19,454
what kind of example you're setting
for your daughter.

931
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:28,380
What's going on around here?

932
01:16:28,546 --> 01:16:31,132
I know, I know. I'll explain inside.
Thank you.

933
01:16:36,137 --> 01:16:38,390
Your mom's lucky.

934
01:16:38,556 --> 01:16:41,601
When they were handing out kids,
they gave her the toughest one.

935
01:16:42,185 --> 01:16:43,186
Lieutenant Trouble.

936
01:16:44,187 --> 01:16:45,730
You remembered.

937
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:48,525
Is that mine?

938
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:50,860
No, no.

939
01:16:51,569 --> 01:16:53,780
You hang on to it until I come back.

940
01:16:54,447 --> 01:16:56,866
But there is something
that I need your help with.

941
01:16:57,033 --> 01:16:59,703
I can't wear these Kree colors anymore.

942
01:16:59,869 --> 01:17:04,791
And since you are obviously the only person
around here with any sense of style...

943
01:17:12,882 --> 01:17:14,092
No.

944
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:17,429
Uh-uh.

945
01:17:18,888 --> 01:17:20,473
Definitely not.

946
01:17:23,518 --> 01:17:25,854
Well, since we're on the same team...

947
01:17:39,451 --> 01:17:41,036
How do I look?

948
01:17:44,581 --> 01:17:45,874
Fresh.

949
01:18:05,769 --> 01:18:07,020
What took you so long?

950
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:10,148
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

951
01:18:10,857 --> 01:18:13,193
-PRY46-B...
-No, no codes.

952
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,111
That system is fallible,
as we've learned.

953
01:18:16,112 --> 01:18:17,822
Okay, then let's do this.

954
01:18:18,531 --> 01:18:21,701
Who do I see when I
commune with the Supreme Intelligence?

955
01:18:21,868 --> 01:18:24,579
The person you most admire and respect,
I'd guess.

956
01:18:24,746 --> 01:18:25,955
But you would never tell me who.

957
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:30,585
And what is your earliest memory of Hala?

958
01:18:30,752 --> 01:18:32,253
The transfusion.

959
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,506
Blue blood running through my veins.

960
01:18:34,673 --> 01:18:35,674
Whose blood?

961
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:50,855
That's my blood that's coursing
through her veins.

962
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:56,861
What have you done with her?

963
01:18:57,028 --> 01:18:58,988
You're too late.

964
01:19:15,588 --> 01:19:16,631
She knows?

965
01:19:31,312 --> 01:19:34,607
Ronan, Skrulls have infiltrated C-53.

966
01:19:34,774 --> 01:19:35,775
Come at once.

967
01:19:35,942 --> 01:19:38,028
<i>For the good of all Kree, Commander...</i>

968
01:19:38,194 --> 01:19:41,031
<i>the infestation will be eradicated.</i>

969
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,035
Passing 500 and climbing.

970
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:51,416
You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

971
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:54,753
Our little alliance with you
is tenuous at best.

972
01:19:54,919 --> 01:19:57,630
And as long as he continues to
freak you out...

973
01:19:57,797 --> 01:19:58,965
like that...

974
01:19:59,132 --> 01:20:04,471
yeah, I'm gonna keep giving him
all the loves and hugs that he needs, right?

975
01:20:04,637 --> 01:20:06,222
Can I ask you something?

976
01:20:06,389 --> 01:20:08,475
Do you just turn into anything you want?

977
01:20:08,641 --> 01:20:10,310
Well, I have to see it first.

978
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:11,561
Can you all do it?

979
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:13,813
Physiologically? Yeah.

980
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:16,149
But it takes practice...

981
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:20,028
and, dare I say it, talent to do it well.

982
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:22,655
-Can you turn into a cat?
-What's a cat?

983
01:20:22,822 --> 01:20:23,907
What about a filing cabinet?

984
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:27,410
Why would I turn into a filing cabinet?

985
01:20:27,577 --> 01:20:28,661
A Venus flytrap?

986
01:20:28,828 --> 01:20:31,122
I'll give you 50 bucks right now
if you turn into a Venus flytrap.

987
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:35,251
Switching engines from Scramjet to Fusion.
Buckle up, folks.

988
01:20:44,427 --> 01:20:45,428
Hey.

989
01:20:45,595 --> 01:20:48,098
Is this normal, like, space turbulence?

990
01:20:48,264 --> 01:20:49,182
Pretty much.

991
01:21:22,924 --> 01:21:24,926
Locking in on coordinate grid.

992
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:26,720
Where is it?

993
01:21:30,223 --> 01:21:32,976
It's here. It's gotta be here.

994
01:21:33,143 --> 01:21:38,440
Well, is it in front of all that nothing,
or behind it?

995
01:21:43,945 --> 01:21:45,989
<i>Decloaking activated.</i>

996
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:50,720
Is that it? The core?

997
01:22:50,887 --> 01:22:53,181
In her notes she called it the Tesseract.

998
01:23:01,981 --> 01:23:04,192
What was Lawson doing
with all this kid stuff?

999
01:23:18,123 --> 01:23:19,165
We're not alone.

1000
01:23:42,313 --> 01:23:43,648
Talos!

1001
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:56,453
He didn't come here for the Tesseract.

1002
01:24:19,059 --> 01:24:20,268
It's okay.

1003
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:26,816
We didn't know what to do.

1004
01:24:26,983 --> 01:24:30,278
Mar-Vell warned us not to send a signal
for any reason...

1005
01:24:30,445 --> 01:24:31,738
or the Kree would find us.

1006
01:24:32,155 --> 01:24:34,282
You did the right thing.

1007
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:45,126
It's okay, it's okay.

1008
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:47,754
She's all right. She's a friend.

1009
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:51,424
I am not gonna hurt you.

1010
01:24:51,716 --> 01:24:53,593
She led me to you.

1011
01:24:54,344 --> 01:24:55,845
I'm so sorry.

1012
01:24:57,555 --> 01:24:58,807
I didn't know.

1013
01:24:58,973 --> 01:25:00,016
Carol.

1014
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:02,811
This is war.

1015
01:25:03,645 --> 01:25:07,023
My hands are filthy from it, too.

1016
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:09,567
But we're here now.

1017
01:25:09,984 --> 01:25:13,029
You found my family.

1018
01:25:16,074 --> 01:25:17,242
This is just the beginning.

1019
01:25:18,034 --> 01:25:20,912
There are thousands of us
separated from each other...

1020
01:25:22,038 --> 01:25:24,749
scattered throughout the galaxy.

1021
01:25:42,517 --> 01:25:44,728
If I played the same pinball machine
for six years...

1022
01:25:44,894 --> 01:25:46,813
I'd have some high scores, too.

1023
01:25:49,941 --> 01:25:51,735
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1024
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,000
What did you do to your uniform?

1025
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:09,169
They got in her head.
Just like we thought.

1026
01:26:09,336 --> 01:26:11,004
The Supreme Intelligence will
set her straight.

1027
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:12,589
You can see they're not soldiers.

1028
01:26:12,756 --> 01:26:15,050
Let 'em go. You can have me.

1029
01:26:15,216 --> 01:26:16,384
And the core?

1030
01:26:16,885 --> 01:26:18,219
You lied to me.

1031
01:26:18,386 --> 01:26:22,307
I made you the best version of yourself.

1032
01:26:25,769 --> 01:26:28,688
What's given can be taken away.

1033
01:26:42,535 --> 01:26:43,495
Back here! Move, move!

1034
01:26:43,661 --> 01:26:46,122
Get over here. Get down!

1035
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:49,334
Let's go! Go, move!

1036
01:27:28,748 --> 01:27:29,749
There she is.

1037
01:27:30,417 --> 01:27:33,962
Seems like your time on C-53
jogged the old memory.

1038
01:27:34,838 --> 01:27:36,089
This jacket.

1039
01:27:36,715 --> 01:27:38,717
It's killer, by the way.

1040
01:27:41,678 --> 01:27:43,680
The music.
It's a nice touch.

1041
01:27:43,972 --> 01:27:45,598
Let me out.

1042
01:27:45,765 --> 01:27:47,142
No can do.

1043
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:51,396
If you hurt them,
I will burn you to the ground.

1044
01:27:51,563 --> 01:27:53,314
With what exactly?

1045
01:27:53,481 --> 01:27:54,816
Your power comes from us.

1046
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:56,735
You didn't give me these powers.

1047
01:27:56,901 --> 01:27:57,944
The blast did.

1048
01:27:58,111 --> 01:28:00,572
And yet, you've never had the strength
to control them on your own.

1049
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,295
<i>Species: Flerken. Threat: high.</i>

1050
01:28:20,633 --> 01:28:22,510
It's a cat, not Hannibal Lecter.

1051
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:27,640
<i>Species: human male.</i>

1052
01:28:27,807 --> 01:28:30,060
<i>Threat: low to none.</i>

1053
01:28:31,227 --> 01:28:32,520
That thing's clearly busted.

1054
01:28:32,687 --> 01:28:34,814
Load the Flerken onto the <i>Helion.</i>

1055
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:37,567
Eject the others into space.

1056
01:28:40,445 --> 01:28:42,489
You did good, Ace.

1057
01:28:44,115 --> 01:28:45,116
Thanks to you...

1058
01:28:45,283 --> 01:28:48,870
those insidious shapeshifters
will threaten our borders no more.

1059
01:28:49,037 --> 01:28:51,289
I used to believe your lies...

1060
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:54,084
but the Skrulls are just fighting
for a home.

1061
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:57,504
You're talking about destroying them
because they won't submit to your rule.

1062
01:28:57,671 --> 01:28:58,797
And neither will I.

1063
01:28:58,963 --> 01:29:02,133
We found you.
We embraced you as our own.

1064
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:03,718
You stole me.

1065
01:29:03,885 --> 01:29:06,596
From my home, my family, my friends.

1066
01:29:14,688 --> 01:29:16,564
It's cute how hard you try.

1067
01:29:18,692 --> 01:29:20,360
But remember...

1068
01:29:21,695 --> 01:29:22,904
without us...

1069
01:29:23,071 --> 01:29:24,155
<i>Give it up, Carol.</i>

1070
01:29:25,865 --> 01:29:27,075
<i>Stay down!</i>

1071
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:28,326
...you're weak.

1072
01:29:28,827 --> 01:29:30,578
<i>You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!</i>

1073
01:29:30,745 --> 01:29:32,080
You're flawed.

1074
01:29:32,247 --> 01:29:33,456
<i>Are you trying to kill yourself?</i>

1075
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:35,333
Helpless.

1076
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:36,584
<i>You're too emotional and so weak.</i>

1077
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,420
<i>You don't belong out here!</i>

1078
01:29:39,087 --> 01:29:40,547
We saved you.

1079
01:29:40,714 --> 01:29:41,756
<i>Control it.</i>

1080
01:29:41,923 --> 01:29:43,258
<i>-I told you, Carol.
-They'll never let you fly.</i>

1081
01:29:43,425 --> 01:29:45,260
<i>-This ain't a game for little girls.
-You kiss like a horse.</i>

1082
01:29:45,427 --> 01:29:46,428
<i>You won't last a week, Danvers.</i>

1083
01:29:49,848 --> 01:29:52,934
Without us, you're only human.

1084
01:29:54,394 --> 01:29:55,645
You're right.

1085
01:29:56,896 --> 01:29:59,024
I'm only human.

1086
01:30:32,974 --> 01:30:36,311
On Hala, you were reborn...

1087
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:37,854
Vers.

1088
01:30:42,859 --> 01:30:45,779
My name is Carol.

1089
01:31:00,543 --> 01:31:02,128
She's trying to break out.

1090
01:31:46,423 --> 01:31:49,759
I've been fighting
with one arm tied behind my back.

1091
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:52,846
But what happens when...

1092
01:31:55,432 --> 01:31:57,475
I'm finally set free?

1093
01:32:37,974 --> 01:32:40,518
You know you're glowing, right?

1094
01:32:40,685 --> 01:32:41,686
I'll explain it later.

1095
01:32:44,397 --> 01:32:45,565
Take the Tesseract.

1096
01:32:45,732 --> 01:32:46,858
Leave the lunchbox.

1097
01:32:47,025 --> 01:32:48,526
-Me?
-Yes.

1098
01:32:48,693 --> 01:32:50,028
I'm not touching that thing.

1099
01:32:50,195 --> 01:32:51,279
You want me to get you an oven mitt?

1100
01:33:04,959 --> 01:33:07,462
Get the Skrulls on the Quadjet and go.

1101
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:09,798
Take the Flerken with you.

1102
01:33:10,465 --> 01:33:12,175
-What about you?
-I'll buy you some time!

1103
01:33:14,094 --> 01:33:15,929
I'm picking you up now.

1104
01:33:19,057 --> 01:33:21,559
I'm trusting you not to eat me.

1105
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:27,774
Hey, guys.

1106
01:33:31,653 --> 01:33:33,321
Arm wrestle for the Tesseract?

1107
01:33:36,449 --> 01:33:38,326
I used to find you amusing.

1108
01:33:39,035 --> 01:33:40,036
Let's put an end to this.

1109
01:34:15,447 --> 01:34:16,448
Okay.

1110
01:34:16,906 --> 01:34:18,116
Good kitty.

1111
01:35:04,662 --> 01:35:06,414
You knew all along.

1112
01:35:07,499 --> 01:35:08,625
Is that why we never hung out?

1113
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:09,918
No, I just never liked you.

1114
01:35:17,175 --> 01:35:18,134
Incoming!

1115
01:35:26,685 --> 01:35:27,686
Hey, in a hurry?

1116
01:35:29,938 --> 01:35:31,690
Don't make me do this.

1117
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:32,941
Okay.

1118
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:49,791
Come on, do your thing!

1119
01:35:51,001 --> 01:35:52,085
Come on!

1120
01:35:54,421 --> 01:35:55,839
Come on!

1121
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:00,260
Damn it, Goose.

1122
01:36:00,427 --> 01:36:01,553
Pick a side.

1123
01:36:05,765 --> 01:36:07,642
Take them to the hangar, too.

1124
01:36:07,809 --> 01:36:09,602
We'll blast them all into space.

1125
01:36:11,688 --> 01:36:12,689
Play it cool.

1126
01:36:14,190 --> 01:36:15,525
Just like Havana.

1127
01:36:17,318 --> 01:36:19,446
Do you have the thing?

1128
01:36:19,612 --> 01:36:21,156
Flerken kitty ate it.

1129
01:36:34,544 --> 01:36:35,920
Come on, move!

1130
01:36:36,087 --> 01:36:37,255
Move!

1131
01:36:37,839 --> 01:36:39,132
Follow my lead.

1132
01:36:43,136 --> 01:36:44,137
Cover her eyes.

1133
01:36:53,063 --> 01:36:54,147
Onto the ship!

1134
01:36:54,314 --> 01:36:56,066
Let's go! Let's go!

1135
01:37:19,464 --> 01:37:20,924
Nice diversion.

1136
01:37:21,299 --> 01:37:23,051
I could have swore I put it in there.

1137
01:38:20,066 --> 01:38:22,152
Minn-Erva, take them down
in the drop ship.

1138
01:38:22,318 --> 01:38:23,403
On it.

1139
01:38:28,074 --> 01:38:29,200
You all right, friend?

1140
01:38:30,285 --> 01:38:32,203
Never better.

1141
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,793
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1142
01:40:18,685 --> 01:40:20,311
Yes! Boom!

1143
01:40:40,874 --> 01:40:42,208
What the hell was that?

1144
01:41:05,607 --> 01:41:07,734
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1145
01:41:59,994 --> 01:42:01,413
That's impossible.

1146
01:42:01,579 --> 01:42:06,668
C-53 doesn't have a defense system
advanced enough to destroy our warheads.

1147
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,630
That's not their defense system, Ronan.

1148
01:42:15,093 --> 01:42:16,261
Take her down.

1149
01:43:26,831 --> 01:43:28,750
Return to the jump point.

1150
01:43:29,793 --> 01:43:31,920
We'll be back for the weapon.

1151
01:43:33,463 --> 01:43:34,672
The core?

1152
01:43:36,508 --> 01:43:37,801
The woman.

1153
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:27,392
I'm so proud of you.

1154
01:44:29,394 --> 01:44:32,814
You've come a long way since I found you
that day by the lake.

1155
01:44:33,356 --> 01:44:37,777
But can you keep your emotions in check
long enough to take me on?

1156
01:44:37,944 --> 01:44:40,613
Or will they get the better of you as always?

1157
01:44:42,157 --> 01:44:43,825
I always told you...

1158
01:44:43,992 --> 01:44:47,704
you'll be ready the day
you can knock me down as yourself.

1159
01:44:47,871 --> 01:44:49,330
This is that moment.

1160
01:44:49,497 --> 01:44:52,000
This is that moment, Vers!

1161
01:44:52,167 --> 01:44:53,251
Turn off the light show...

1162
01:44:53,418 --> 01:44:56,755
and prove to me
you can beat me without...

1163
01:45:12,270 --> 01:45:14,272
I have nothing to prove to you.

1164
01:45:30,121 --> 01:45:32,165
<i>Destination: Hala.</i>

1165
01:45:32,332 --> 01:45:33,958
I can't go back empty-handed.

1166
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:35,877
You won't be empty-handed.

1167
01:45:36,044 --> 01:45:38,338
I'm sending you with a message.

1168
01:45:38,505 --> 01:45:41,675
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

1169
01:45:41,841 --> 01:45:44,594
The war. The lies.
All of it.

1170
01:45:46,471 --> 01:45:47,847
You can't do this.

1171
01:46:06,741 --> 01:46:10,745
That was a close call, huh, Goosey? Huh?

1172
01:46:11,496 --> 01:46:13,206
Those bad guys still in there somewhere?

1173
01:46:14,124 --> 01:46:15,375
Mother Flerken!

1174
01:46:15,542 --> 01:46:16,626
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1175
01:46:17,085 --> 01:46:18,628
It's just a scratch.

1176
01:46:19,004 --> 01:46:20,296
No.

1177
01:46:28,555 --> 01:46:31,099
I can't believe you got
in the raddest dogfight ever...

1178
01:46:31,266 --> 01:46:32,642
and I missed it.

1179
01:46:32,809 --> 01:46:34,394
I'd say you arrived just in time.

1180
01:46:34,561 --> 01:46:36,604
Some nifty flying you did out there.

1181
01:46:36,771 --> 01:46:38,773
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use
a good pilot like you.

1182
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:40,650
I'll consider it...

1183
01:46:40,817 --> 01:46:43,820
as long as you never
call my flying "nifty" again.

1184
01:46:43,987 --> 01:46:45,155
How's your eye?

1185
01:46:46,031 --> 01:46:47,365
Getting better every second.

1186
01:46:47,532 --> 01:46:48,742
Just so I'm clear...

1187
01:46:48,908 --> 01:46:50,285
you were Soh-Larr...

1188
01:46:50,452 --> 01:46:52,495
-and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
-Keller.

1189
01:46:52,996 --> 01:46:55,331
He tied my boss up, stole his identity.

1190
01:46:55,498 --> 01:46:58,334
I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.

1191
01:46:58,501 --> 01:46:59,753
It is a little like stealing.

1192
01:46:59,919 --> 01:47:01,212
Whose side are you on here?

1193
01:47:01,588 --> 01:47:03,048
You're good to go here until you recover...

1194
01:47:03,214 --> 01:47:06,259
but you and your family are gonna need
a new look.

1195
01:47:06,426 --> 01:47:08,011
I could go back to being your boss.

1196
01:47:08,178 --> 01:47:09,179
Please don't.

1197
01:47:09,346 --> 01:47:12,182
Come on.
I loved sporting his beautiful blue eyes.

1198
01:47:12,349 --> 01:47:14,726
No way. You guys have the best eyes.

1199
01:47:14,893 --> 01:47:16,853
Don't ever change your eyes.

1200
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:18,313
She has beautiful eyes.
That's very sweet of you.

1201
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,148
I was trying not to panic...

1202
01:47:20,315 --> 01:47:21,775
I'll help you find a home.

1203
01:47:22,859 --> 01:47:23,985
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1204
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:28,239
They can stay here with us.

1205
01:47:28,406 --> 01:47:29,991
Can't they, Mom?

1206
01:47:30,158 --> 01:47:32,077
They won't be safe here, baby.

1207
01:47:32,702 --> 01:47:34,245
Auntie Carol's right.

1208
01:47:34,412 --> 01:47:35,413
They need their own home.

1209
01:47:36,623 --> 01:47:38,416
I'll be back before you know it.

1210
01:47:38,875 --> 01:47:42,170
Or maybe I could fly up
and meet you halfway?

1211
01:47:42,337 --> 01:47:45,131
Only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

1212
01:47:45,298 --> 01:47:47,300
Or maybe I'll build a spaceship.
You don't know.

1213
01:47:47,467 --> 01:47:48,510
He doesn't.

1214
01:47:58,269 --> 01:48:00,689
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.

1215
01:48:01,398 --> 01:48:02,399
Hidden.

1216
01:48:02,565 --> 01:48:04,609
You sure that's what Marvel would want?

1217
01:48:05,276 --> 01:48:06,361
Mar-Vell.

1218
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:07,821
That's what I said.

1219
01:48:07,987 --> 01:48:10,323
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1220
01:48:10,490 --> 01:48:11,825
Mar-Vell.

1221
01:48:11,991 --> 01:48:14,452
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.
You know, like the Marvelettes.

1222
01:48:28,383 --> 01:48:29,426
Not ringing any bells?

1223
01:48:29,592 --> 01:48:31,386
Keep singing.
Maybe it'll come back to me.

1224
01:48:46,735 --> 01:48:48,236
I upgraded it.

1225
01:48:48,862 --> 01:48:51,322
Range should be a couple galaxies,
at least.

1226
01:48:53,950 --> 01:48:56,161
What? You think I'm gonna crank call you?

1227
01:48:56,327 --> 01:48:59,873
For emergencies only, okay?

1228
01:49:05,712 --> 01:49:06,629
Well...

1229
01:49:07,339 --> 01:49:09,591
if you're ever passing
back through this galaxy...

1230
01:49:09,758 --> 01:49:11,801
be sure to give a brother a shout.

1231
01:49:28,568 --> 01:49:30,612
We got the ketchup stain off.

1232
01:49:36,034 --> 01:49:37,827
Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble.

1233
01:49:47,128 --> 01:49:49,714
It's hard for me to say goodbye, too.

1234
01:50:03,395 --> 01:50:04,562
Go on.

1235
01:51:11,629 --> 01:51:14,382
Glad to have you back, sir.
This came for you.

1236
01:51:19,304 --> 01:51:20,513
So, is it true?

1237
01:51:21,598 --> 01:51:22,807
That the Kree burned your eye out...

1238
01:51:22,974 --> 01:51:25,393
because you refused to give them
the Tesseract?

1239
01:51:26,353 --> 01:51:30,023
I will neither confirm nor deny
the facts of that story.

1240
01:51:30,273 --> 01:51:31,358
Understood.

1241
01:51:32,984 --> 01:51:34,986
I'm sorry to report
that we still haven't found the Tesseract.

1242
01:51:35,153 --> 01:51:37,364
I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.

1243
01:51:38,990 --> 01:51:40,700
I'll let you know when it does.

1244
01:51:40,867 --> 01:51:42,243
Then what?

1245
01:51:42,952 --> 01:51:43,787
Sir?

1246
01:51:44,162 --> 01:51:48,416
We have no idea what other
intergalactic threats are out there.

1247
01:51:48,583 --> 01:51:51,878
And our one-woman security force
had a prior commitment...

1248
01:51:52,045 --> 01:51:53,838
on the other side of the universe.

1249
01:51:56,675 --> 01:51:58,718
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone can't protect us.

1250
01:52:00,470 --> 01:52:02,013
We need to find more.

1251
01:52:02,305 --> 01:52:03,306
More weapons?

1252
01:52:03,473 --> 01:52:05,183
More heroes.

1253
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:07,227
You think you can find others like her?

1254
01:52:07,394 --> 01:52:09,979
We found her,
and we weren't even looking.

1255
01:52:11,064 --> 01:52:12,357
Get some rest, sir.

1256
01:52:13,441 --> 01:52:15,276
You got a big decision to make.

1257
01:55:14,414 --> 01:55:16,082
This is a nightmare.

1258
01:55:17,792 --> 01:55:20,003
I've had better nightmares.

1259
01:55:22,172 --> 01:55:23,214
Hey.

1260
01:55:24,299 --> 01:55:28,178
So, that thing just stopped doing
whatever the hell it was doing.

1261
01:55:30,096 --> 01:55:31,890
What do we got?

1262
01:55:32,807 --> 01:55:35,143
Whatever signal it was sending
finally crapped out.

1263
01:55:35,310 --> 01:55:37,437
-I thought we bypassed the battery.
-We did.

1264
01:55:37,604 --> 01:55:40,440
It's still plugged in. It just stopped.

1265
01:55:41,358 --> 01:55:43,109
Reboot it. Send the signal again.

1266
01:55:43,276 --> 01:55:44,694
We don't even know what this is.

1267
01:55:44,861 --> 01:55:47,238
Fury did. Just do it, please.

1268
01:55:47,530 --> 01:55:50,033
You tell me the second you get a signal.

1269
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:52,702
I wanna know
who's on the other end of that thing.

1270
01:55:55,622 --> 01:55:57,040
Where's Fury?
