00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,330
it'd be a three-minute wedding
in jeans and T-shirts,

166
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,124
washed down with a bottle of beer.

167
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,417
You make me sound so unromantic!

168
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,378
I just thought we should save
our money for traveling.

169
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,296
Well, we're not going anywhere yet.

170
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,341
Anyway, please leave.
We're very, very busy.

171

SOPHIE: For his bachelor party.

174
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,561
Why haven't you told him
you've invited your dads?

175
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,896
Because he would say that
I'd have to tell my mom.

176
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,023
Donna's absolutely gonna kill you
when she finds out.

177
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,026
By the time she finds
out, it'll be too late.

178
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,239
I feel like there's a part of me missing,

179
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,701
and when I meet my dad,

180
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:06,833
everything will fall into place.

- Not with all that plastic surgery.

Of course I do, Auntie Tanya.
You haven't changed at all.

She's a chip off the old block.

262
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,822
If she were more like me,
she wouldn't be getting married at 20.

263

Or married at all.

I meant to get the laundry down
before you came.

ROSIE: Tanya's going home!

266
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,957
And you'd think with all this
new technology,

267
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,043
they would figure out a machine
that would make the beds.

268
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,379
And if they did,
you'd be going along behind it,

269
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,755
making them again.

SKY: I'm designing a website.

274
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:19,562
I just think this place has so much
potential, and no one knows we're here.

275
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:23,983
So, if I market it really, really well, then,
hopefully, people will come flooding in.

276
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,987
We just want this to be
the ultimate romantic destination.

277
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,448
This was once supposed to be
the site of Aphrodite's fountain,

278
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,075
you know, the goddess of love.
And if you drank the water,

279
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,828
you were supposed to find true love
and perfect happiness.

280

- I'll have a glass of that.
- Yeah, I'll have a bucket.

Well, I thought you didn't want
boatloads of tourists.

283
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,505
Oh, no, not boatloads, no.

284
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:49,050
But, you know, a few more would be nice.

285
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:54,388
Okay, now, the thing about the toilet,

286
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,560
if it doesn't flush right away, just go
and come back in a while, and it should...

287
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,189
Nothing works around here, except for me.

288
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,568
I've been running this hotel for 15 years,
and I have never had a day off.

A man like that is hard to find

00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,918
My, my
Just how much I've missed you

482
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,505
Yes, I've been broken-hearted

483
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,967
Blue since the day we parted

484
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,303
Why, why
did I ever let you go?

485
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,723
Mamma mia
Now I really know

486
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:25,018
My, my
I should not have let you go

487
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,691
I was angry and sad

488
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,860
When I knew we were through

489
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,573
I can't count all the times

490
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,449
I have cried over you

491
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:45,873
Look at me now
Will I ever learn?

492
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,000
I don't know how

493
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,503
But I suddenly lose control

494
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:55,424
There's a fire within my soul

495
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,927
Just one look and
I can hear a bell ring

496
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,431
One more look and
I forget everything

497
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:07,060
Mamma mia
Here I go again

498
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,522
My, my
How can I resist you?

499
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:14,109
Mamma mia
Does it show again?

500
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,613
My, my
Just how much I've missed you

501
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,116
Yes, I've been broken-hearted

did I ever let you go?

504
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,543
Mamma mia
Now I really know

505
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:35,464
My, my
I should not have let you go

506
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,260
You always knew how to make an entrance.

507
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,054
(CHUCKLING)

508
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,267
I'd better be dreaming.
You'd better not be here.

509
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,727
You want me to pinch you, Donna?

510
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,690
No! You keep your hands to yourself,
Bill Anderson.

511
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,319
You probably don't recognize me, do you?

512
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,073
Harry! It is you!

513
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,952
I probably changed a bit,
but you certainly haven't.

514
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,748
Why are you here?
What are you doing here?

515
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,500
I'm writing a travel piece.

516
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,502
(HESITANTLY) I'm here on
a spontaneous holiday.

517
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,586
Uh-huh.

518
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,631
I just dropped in to say hi.

519
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,509
(STAMMERING) Okay. What is this?

520
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,471
It's one of those serendipitous moments
in life when three complete strangers

521
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,431
share a common thought.

522
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,101
Strangers?

523
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,814
- You don't know each other?
- That's generally the definition.

524
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,942
Okay, good, but who... Why are you here?

525
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,361
Who said that you could
stay up in my old goat-house?

526
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,988
- BILL: Didn't catch the name.
- Greek lady.

527
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,823
- Well, she spoke Greek.
- Yeah.

528
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,033
Or maybe she said we couldn't
stay in the old goat-house.

529
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,160
- Yeah, maybe that was it, in Greek.
- There you go.

530
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,830
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
You can't stay here because

531
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,874
I'm closed and I'm full.

532
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,753
And I'm busy, I'm really...
I have a wedding, my...

533
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,255
Local girl's getting married...

534
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,673
Donna. Donna, don't worry about us.

535
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,216
Bill here is used to roughing it.

536
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,802
- And Harry here...
- I'm spontaneous.

537
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,262
- Spontaneous.
- DONNA: Ah.

538
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,224
What about you?

539
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,518
Just wanted to see the island.

540
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,229
You know what it meant to me.

541
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,568
Okay, I'm gonna arrange for a boat

542
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,196
to take you all back to the mainland.

543
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,240
- I have a boat, Donna.
- You have a boat?

544
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,700
Good, get on it,

545
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:27,951
and anchors away.

546
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,078
- Hey, Donna...
- Away, away.

547
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,456
ALL: It's good to see you.

548

549
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,841
Now, baby, this should
tickle your taste buds.

550
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:46,136
Down, big fella.
I'm old enough to be your mother.

552
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,556
Where's Sophie?

553
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,726
- I think she went down to the beach.
- What's up?

554
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,231
(CRYING)

555
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,944
ROSIE: Donna?

556
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,367
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

557

Oh, me.

(SINGING) I have never seen such sorrow

565

BOTH: In your eyes

566
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:46,363
And the wedding is tomorrow

567
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:53,453
How I hate to see you like this

568
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:58,291
There is no way you can deny it

569
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:02,504
BOTH: I can see

570
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,006
That you're oh, so sad

571
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,134
So quiet

572
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:15,892
Chiquitita, tell me the truth

573
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:22,023
I'm a shoulder you can cry on

574
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:27,779
Your best friend

575
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:32,367
I'm the one you must rely on

576
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,330
You were always sure of yourself

577
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:43,628
Now I see you've broken a feather

578
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:53,346
I hope we can patch it up

579
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,098
Together

580
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:02,397
Chiquitita, you and I know

581
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,608
How the heartaches come and they go

582
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:08,403
And the scars, they're leaving

583
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,781
You'll be dancing once again

584
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,618
And the pain will end

585
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,622
You will have no time for grieving

586

Chiquitita, you and I cry

587

But the sun is still in the sky

588

And shining above you

589

Let me hear you sing once more

590

Like you did before

591
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:42,270
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

592
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,025
Try once more

593
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,569
Like I did before

594
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,280
Sing a new song

- It's her dad.
- Whose dad?

596

Sophie's dad.

00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,709
Remember how I said it was Sam?
Sam the architect,

598
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,419
who had to go home to get married?

599
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,798
I'm not sure that it was him,

600
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,469
because there were two other guys
around the same time.

Donna Sheridan. You shady lady.

Why didn't you tell us?

603
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,979
Well, I never knew that
I would ever, ever have to.

604
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,190
I never imagined I'd see all three of them

Wait a minute! Don't let them hear you!

00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,007
- There's no one here.
- Are you sure?

614
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,508
Of course I'm sure!

615
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,177
Do you think
I would forget my daughter's dads?

616

back to their boat.

I hope they run aground and drown.

01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:52,305
Well, I didn't think
it was any of your business.

1124
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:54,432
Why is she getting married?
Settling down on the island?

1125
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:57,644
I mean, if it was up to me,
I'd be telling her to go get a life.

1126
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:59,437
- Yeah.
- She's a bright kid.

has a mind of her own.

Oh, yeah. I see that. I see that.

- But she's so young.
- I know.

01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,328
I mean, does she know
what she really wants?

1132
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:18,498
You see, I think part of her
just wants to let you know

1133
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,168
that she isn't going to leave you
alone here, on your own.

I know something about letting go.

If Sophie felt you were okay on your own,

1137
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:34,806
would she want something different
for herself?

1140

I get up and I thank God

that I don't have some middle-aged,
menopausal man

telling me how to run my life.

It's about knowing who I am. And I wanted
to get married knowing who I am.

That doesn't come from finding your father,

Because I loved you
and I wanted what you wanted.

01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,906
- Sophie, what's wrong?
- Not now, Sam.

1273
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,574
Yes, yes, yes, now.

1274
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,743
Because I'm supposed to be
giving you away.

1275
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:17,912
And how can I when I know
you're not really gonna be happy?

1276
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:21,165
I've heard all this from my mother, and
I think she knows me better than you do.

1277
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:24,085
I know. But I've done the big
white wedding, and believe me,

1278
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:27,880
- it doesn't always end in "happy ever after."
- That is you. That's not me.

1279
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:30,841
Okay? I love Sky more than anything
in the world. And I...

(GRUNTS)

1281
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:34,929
Did you feel that way
before you got married?

1282
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:37,848
No.

1283
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,827
Hey, aren't you supposed to be
getting dressed?

1284
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:01,038
Where's Ali and Lisa?
I thought they were going to help you.

1285
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,748
Will you help me?

1286
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:04,917
Mmm-hmm.

(GIGGLES SOFTLY)

(CHUCKLING) Wait. It's okay, it's okay.

1289

Waving goodbye

With an absent-minded smile

1295
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:35,448
I watch her go

1296
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:39,910
With a surge of that well-known sadness

1297
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:45,416
And I have to sit down for a while

1298
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:49,545
The feeling that I'm losing her

1299
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:52,923
Forever

1300
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:59,138
And without really entering her world

1301
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:04,643
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter

The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Barely awake

1313
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:54,902
I let precious time go by

1314
01:16:54,985 --> 01:17:01,784
Then when she's gone
There's that odd melancholy feeling

1315
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:08,541
And a sense of guilt I can't deny

1316
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:15,214
What happened to

Why would you even think that?

1332
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:19,570
Well, because of what you've done.

1333
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:22,740
I mean, the Dynamos, raising a kid,

1334
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:25,159
and running a business all on your own.

1335

Well, honey, I didn't have a choice.

I couldn't go home, you know.

1337

When I got pregnant, my mother told me
not to bother coming back.

01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:43,302
And I wouldn't have had it any other way.

- That would be me.
- But...

- What about her dad?
- Her dad isn't here.

It's what she wants.
She told me she wants her father here.

- What? Sam, don't do this now.
