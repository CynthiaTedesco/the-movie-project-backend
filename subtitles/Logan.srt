00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't
live up to God's rules.</font>

141
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:12,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knows that you can't.
It's okay, we're imperfect.</font>

142
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make way, sir.</font>

143
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:18,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said make way!</font>

144
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:22,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The new Quesalupa
from Taco Bell!</font>

145
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get it with chicken!
Get it with steak!</font>

146
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And with the cheese baked
right in the shell...</font>

147
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's the next big thing!</font>

148
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go now while supplies last.</font>

149
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

150
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:35,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know who I am.</font>

151
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the man
who puts me to sleep.</font>

152
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We both could use
some sleep.</font>

153
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

154
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing to me?</font>

155
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles.</font>

156
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, now.</font>

157
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:36,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long have I been here?</font>

158
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:58,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are these?</font>

159
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You remember
what they are.</font>

160
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The shots
mellow the seizures.</font>

161
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The pills
keep them from happening.</font>

162
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about you blow on them
to make them safe?</font>

163
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:08,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck off, Logan.</font>

164
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you remember
who I am now.</font>

165
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always know who you are.</font>

166
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just sometimes
I don't recognize you.</font>

167
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:17,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take the pills.</font>

168
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You leave me alone
with that fucking albino.</font>

169
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't listen to me.</font>

170
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know a damn speciation
when I see one.</font>

171
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A what?</font>

172
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:35,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speciation.
New mutant, a young one.</font>

173
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are forces
trying to kill them.</font>

174
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forces?
They want help.</font>

175
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forces, forces.</font>

176
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too bad you're not
in that business anymore.</font>

177
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:47,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't want me,
they want you.</font>

178
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:53,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes, that's how
fucking stupid they are.</font>

179
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:57,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're waiting for you
at the Statue of Liberty.</font>

180
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Statue of Liberty
was a long time ago,</font>

181
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles, a long time.</font>

182
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:04,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are no new mutants.
Understand?</font>

183
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:07,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hasn't been a new one born
in 25 years. Not anywhere.</font>

184
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You always thought...</font>

185
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we were part of God's plan.</font>

186
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But maybe...</font>

187
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we were God's mistake.</font>

188
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:33,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a disappointment
you are.</font>

189
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I found you...</font>

190
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:41,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you were pursuing a career
as a cage fighter.</font>

191
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:44,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A warm capper to a life
as an assassin.</font>

192
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hooked on barbiturates.</font>

193
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were an animal.</font>

194
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we took you in.</font>

195
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gave you a family.</font>

196
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they're gone now.</font>

197
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan.</font>

198
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:00,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan...</font>

199
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:04,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do?</font>

200
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do?</font>

201
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Answer me!
Why are we here?</font>

202
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:12,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one should live
like this.</font>

203
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drugged in a fucking tank!</font>

204
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's for your own good.</font>

205
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:16,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not!</font>

206
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're waiting for me
to die.</font>

207
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't wanna fight...</font>

208
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but there's things
we need to discuss.</font>

209
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:09,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What things?</font>

210
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, would it be
considered nagging...</font>

211
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if I was to repeat
my previous observation...</font>

212
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that the dose is too low
to suppress the seizures?</font>

213
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's what the guy gave me.</font>

214
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wasn't in a position
to make demands.</font>

215
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I almost died this morning.</font>

216
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That seizure was...
It was barely a minute.</font>

217
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It felt a lot longer than a minute.
I couldn't breathe.</font>

218
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're less affected.</font>

219
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know
he needs a higher dose.</font>

220
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:37,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I know you got more
money squirreled away.</font>

221
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:38,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That money's
to get us out of here.</font>

222
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not us.
You and him.</font>

223
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're saving
to buy a Sunseeker.</font>

224
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Sun" is the keyword.</font>

225
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hardly see myself cowering
below decks like Nosferatu.</font>

226
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you?</font>

227
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:52,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Folding your underpants,
and making him spotted dick.</font>

228
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:57,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Found this in your pocket.</font>

229
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:00,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adamantium.</font>

230
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you are planning
to blow your brains out...</font>

231
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">could you wait till you're
out on the high seas?</font>

232
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just mopped
these floors.</font>

233
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:08,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need this shit.</font>

234
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A year ago, you asked
me to help you.</font>

235
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And God knows
I've tried.</font>

236
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can't help you,
Logan, not really...</font>

237
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you're not
going to talk to me.</font>

238
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear you at night.
You're not sleeping.</font>

239
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't wanna
talk about that.</font>

240
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or the booze
you're drinking.</font>

241
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or the pus you're wiping
away from your knuckles.</font>

242
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or the blood
I wash from your clothes.</font>

243
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or the fresh wounds
in your chest.</font>

244
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ones
that aren't healing.</font>

245
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm pretty sure...</font>

246
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you don't wanna talk
about the fact</font>

247
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you can't read
the label on that bottle.</font>

248
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It says, "Ibuprofen."</font>

249
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was my favorite mug.</font>

250
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay out of my shit.</font>

251
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something's happening
to you, Logan.</font>

252
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the inside you're sick.
I can smell it.</font>

253
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Best night ever!</i></font>

254
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:22,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, driver.</font>

255
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.
I love you.</font>

256
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're such a doll.</font>

257
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:43,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Logan.</font>

258
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:44,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Jesus.</font>

259
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please. We need a ride.</font>

260
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not available.
Call a cab.</font>

261
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:49,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name
is Gabriela Lopez.</font>

262
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't wanna
know your name, lady.</font>

263
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are men after us.</font>

264
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to get out of here.</font>

265
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go north,
cross to Canada.</font>

266
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone can do that job.</font>

267
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:58,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll give you $50,000.</font>

268
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you find me, huh?</font>

269
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause you are fucking up
my life, lady!</font>

270
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:05,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The people after you,
they're on my ass now!</font>

271
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:07,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sightings were posted.</font>

272
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:08,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laura, go inside.</font>

273
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What sightings?</font>

274
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People said someone who
looked like the Wolverine</font>

275
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was in El Paso, driving.</font>

276
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Said he looked old.</font>

277
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:19,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

278
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you
to stop it with that ball!</font>

279
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad girl!
No, please.</font>

280
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you, bad girl!
No, please.</font>

281
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Mamacita's</i> gonna
have to pay for that.</font>

282
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop, please. No.</font>

283
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:30,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

284
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're gonna
have to pay for damages.</font>

285
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she has cash.</font>

286
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:38,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've seen it.</font>

287
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should get your fat ass
back in your office.</font>

288
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:41,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll get your money.</font>

289
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let her call anyone,
please.</font>

290
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will find us.
They will kill us.</font>

291
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am a nurse.</font>

292
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was. In Mexico City.</font>

293
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When did that happen?</font>

294
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This morning.
Near the border.</font>

295
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:12,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got away
from them, but...</font>

296
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:16,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...now they know my car.</font>

297
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I gotta go.</font>

298
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, wait. Please. Here.</font>

299
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, wait! Look.</font>

300
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look. Here, take this.
It's $20,000.</font>

301
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. Take us
to this address.</font>

302
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:35,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can have $30,000 more
when we get there.</font>

303
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends there
will give it to you.</font>

304
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will be waiting.</font>

305
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will give you anything.</font>

306
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did you get this?</font>

307
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:46,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My boyfriend.</font>

308
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:50,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wants to kill me
and take her.</font>

309
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's your daughter?</font>

310
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

311
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know
you're still good inside.</font>

312
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you want to help us.</font>

313
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know
anything about me.</font>

314
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please!</font>

315
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise, there will be
no problems if we leave now.</font>

316
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:12,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't just leave
to North Dakota!</font>

317
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to be there Friday.
Or what?</font>

318
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or we miss our chance
to cross.</font>

319
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:18,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

320
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to. Please.</font>

321
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:25,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

322
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like those.
Huh?</font>

323
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They make you look younger.</font>

324
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:42,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles, listen.</font>

325
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta go away
for a few days, okay?</font>

326
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a long ride
for some good money...</font>

327
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but when I get back,
we're gonna get outta here.</font>

328
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna
drive down to Yelapa.</font>

329
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:53,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna
get ourselves a boat.</font>

330
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we're gonna
go live on the ocean.</font>

331
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you be safe there?</font>

332
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. We'll be safe.</font>

333
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look what Logan got us,
Charles.</font>

334
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:11,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be back
in a few days.</font>

335
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

336
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan.
Yeah?</font>

337
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:30,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?</font>

338
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did something go wrong?</font>

339
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The job was wrong
to begin with.</font>

340
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan!</font>

341
00:26:58,368 --> 00:26:59,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan!</font>

342
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:00,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

343
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who does this belong to?</font>

344
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's that?</font>

345
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought you were supposed to
see shit coming.</font>

346
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:19,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can track mutants.</font>

347
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a glorified truffle pig,
not a clairvoyant.</font>

348
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:23,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go inside
and keep Charles quiet.</font>

349
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:24,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go inside now!</font>

350
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:35,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to turn around,
asshole.</font>

351
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is private property.</font>

352
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it is.</font>

353
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact,
I believe it belongs</font>

354
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to a multinational
smelting company...</font>

355
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">based in Shanghai.</font>

356
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you keeping
the old man? Hmm?</font>

357
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:49,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he over there?</font>

358
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:53,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or is he there?</font>

359
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:55,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That'd be smart.</font>

360
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:59,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to meet him.</font>

361
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:02,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm told the HSA
classifies his brain</font>

362
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:04,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a weapon
of mass destruction now.</font>

363
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn shame,
what happened back east.</font>

364
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:09,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's been dead for a year.</font>

365
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need the girl.</font>

366
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What girl?</font>

367
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:16,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The one that goes along with
that ball you're holding.</font>

368
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:18,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no girl here.</font>

369
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:20,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you went
to the motel.</font>

370
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:21,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I was called there.</font>

371
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:23,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was no girl.
It was just the woman.</font>

372
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just the woman.
Such as she was.</font>

373
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:30,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you saw Gabriela.</font>

374
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:35,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you didn't call me.
That hurts.</font>

375
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't shoot
the poor thing, did you?</font>

376
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:39,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, did you?</font>

377
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I asked you first.</font>

378
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like guns.</font>

379
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:43,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

380
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:47,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish
you'd called me, Logan.</font>

381
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:48,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like I asked.</font>

382
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:52,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See?</font>

383
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the only one
that's been enhanced.</font>

384
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:04,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan. Logan!</font>

385
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Laura.</font>

386
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:08,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Caliban, come!</font>

387
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:11,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is who
I've been telling you about.</font>

388
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Laura.</font>

389
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been waiting for you.</font>

390
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come, come here.</font>

391
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:24,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

392
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:26,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come.</font>

393
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laura.</font>

394
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's okay.</font>

395
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:36,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come.</font>

396
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come.</font>

397
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:43,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come. It's okay.
You can stay here, Laura.</font>

398
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:44,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's safe.</font>

399
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can look after you here.</font>

400
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:48,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

401
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like ex-military.
Bounty hunter, maybe?</font>

402
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Worse.</font>

403
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:55,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he by himself?</font>

404
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, not for long.</font>

405
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get him back
in his ride,</font>

406
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">take him out to the wash
and dump him.</font>

407
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:02,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if he wakes up
before I get there?</font>

408
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:10,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Text me where you are.
We'll pick you up.</font>

409
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:24,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

410
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan.</font>

411
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:32,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan.
Hey. Hey!</font>

412
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:35,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll get it back
after I figure out</font>

413
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:36,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what you and your mother
have got us into.</font>

414
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Logan.
What?</font>

415
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:39,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think the...</font>

416
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan, the woman that you met,
that's not her mother.</font>

417
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:54,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So she talks?
We're communicating.</font>

418
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:56,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Communicating.</font>

419
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:58,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take these now.</font>

420
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to get out of here.
It's not safe here anymore.</font>

421
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:04,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you can't have an attack
out there, you understand?</font>

422
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:09,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but this is the mutant
that I told you about.</font>

423
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She needs our help.
She's not a mutant.</font>

424
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:12,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, she is!</font>

425
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:13,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's her gift, Charles?</font>

426
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eating? Pipe throwing?</font>

427
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

428
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:40,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>

429
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:42,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take the gun.
Dump the body.</font>

430
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:45,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Text me when you're
on the way back.</font>

431
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:46,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have anything else
you need?</font>

432
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Food for the kid?</font>

433
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're fucked now, mutie.</font>

434
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

435
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Choo-choo.
- It's not a choo-choo.</font>

436
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. Sit down.</font>

437
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta go.
What?</font>

438
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on? Where?
Stay here.</font>

439
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:22,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.
Where are we going?</font>

440
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, don't worry.
He will be back for you.</font>

441
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:32,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan, the girl. You've got
to go back for the girl.</font>

442
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:40,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan, what about the girl?</font>

443
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:42,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan.</font>

444
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:51,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan, we mustn't forget
about Laura.</font>

445
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not our problem.</font>

446
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:02,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

447
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:12,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, shit!</font>

448
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:41,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan.</font>

449
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:43,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm thinking.</font>

450
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The child.</font>

451
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:46,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan,
we mustn't forget Laura.</font>

452
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please be quiet.
Logan.</font>

453
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh.</font>

454
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:55,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles Xavier.
Where's Caliban?</font>

455
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">America's most wanted
octogenarian.</font>

456
00:33:58,121 --> 00:33:59,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a nonagenarian,
actually.</font>

457
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:06,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>

458
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:09,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Caliban?</font>

459
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:13,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you tell me
where the girl is first?</font>

460
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or I could ask Cue Ball.
He seems quite friendly.</font>

461
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you,
she's not here.</font>

462
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:19,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Caliban,
motherfucker?</font>

463
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:21,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I left him
in the same ditch</font>

464
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:22,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he was gonna leave me in.</font>

465
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, Wolverine,</font>

466
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">seeing you like this
just breaks my damn heart.</font>

467
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:44,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As soon as I rip it out
of your chest, fuck-stick.</font>

468
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:53,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go get her.</font>

469
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:08,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laura.</font>

470
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:13,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That a girl!</font>

471
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:16,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, baby.</font>

472
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laura...</font>

473
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:31,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laura!</font>

474
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, you wanna stay
where you are.</font>

475
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna see
your friends, right?</font>

476
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:39,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Command, stop.</font>

477
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said alive or dead.</font>

478
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:43,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laura!</font>

479
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:46,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laura.</font>

480
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:49,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laura.</font>

481
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No.</font>

482
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move! Go!</font>

483
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:01,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move! Go!</font>

484
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:07,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop shooting!</font>

485
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She heals! Move! Go!</font>

486
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:13,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit!</font>

487
00:37:58,402 --> 00:37:59,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotcha!</font>

488
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

489
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:11,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, hold her down.</font>

490
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:06,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As I told you, Logan,
she's a mutant like you.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on!</font>

492
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:12,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very much like you.</font>

493
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:35,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laura, are you all right?</font>

494
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:48,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh!</font>

495
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move!</font>

496
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:05,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on!</font>

497
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck! Come on!</font>

498
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:15,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

499
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:24,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

500
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:18,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fall in! Let's go!</font>

501
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, watch out!</font>

502
00:41:26,944 --> 00:41:27,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

503
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:11,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit back.</font>

504
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring me the tracker.</font>

505
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:31,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You.</font>

506
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:34,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the hell are you?</font>

507
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:38,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! I asked you a question.
Who are you?</font>

508
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know
who she is, Logan.</font>

509
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:43,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I don't.</font>

510
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does she remind you
of anybody?</font>

511
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:19,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I read about you
when I was a kid.</font>

512
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe you're thinking
of someone else.</font>

513
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:24,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

514
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:35,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, if I'm not mistaken,
you used to work for my team.</font>

515
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:38,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were helping round up
all those old mutes.</font>

516
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:41,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What changed?</font>

517
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:43,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got religion?</font>

518
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:49,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna need you to do</font>

519
00:43:49,378 --> 00:43:51,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one more thing
for the good guys...</font>

520
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:56,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and track one more
special mute for me.</font>

521
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:01,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not helping you.</font>

522
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:03,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, you'd say that.</font>

523
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:07,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I got a theory that
people don't really change.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beware of the light.</font>

525
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:16,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Caliban, I bet that's what
your mama told you</font>

526
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">every day when you was a kid.</font>

528
00:44:31,337 --> 00:44:34,087

the worst in each other.</font>

trust me.</font>

530
00:44:36,008 --> 00:44:38,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not a natural fuck-up
like you.</font>

531
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:41,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a business mistake,
a R&D gone bad.</font>

532
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:42,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's liability.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">They can't have things
with patents</font>

hurting people, can they?</font>

535
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:49,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to get her off the board</font>

00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before she hurts anybody else.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my son, Nate.</font>

819
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:39,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.
Hey.</font>

820
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's your daughter?</font>

821
01:09:40,845 --> 01:09:43,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's Laura,
and that's my dad...</font>

822
01:09:43,764 --> 01:09:44,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chuck.</font>

823
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:46,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Laura, let's go.</font>

824
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, can we show
our appreciation</font>

825
01:09:48,102 --> 01:09:49,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and treat the three of you
to a decent meal?</font>

826
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:51,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't live far from here.</font>

827
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, no, thanks.
That would be lovely!</font>

828
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:02,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Dr. Rice.</font>

829
01:10:03,242 --> 01:10:04,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can call me Zander
if you like.</font>

830
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:07,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My colleague tells me</font>

831
01:10:07,705 --> 01:10:10,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you've been
somewhat resistant.</font>

832
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:12,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He believes you've been</font>

833
01:10:12,293 --> 01:10:14,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">dispensing
delayed information...</font>

834
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:16,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to allow your friends
to stay one step ahead.</font>

835
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:20,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm offering you
the possibility</font>

836
01:10:20,968 --> 01:10:22,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of redemption, Caliban.</font>

837
01:10:23,387 --> 01:10:25,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To protect the world,
and in the process,</font>

838
01:10:25,306 --> 01:10:26,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">save your friends.</font>

839
01:10:26,724 --> 01:10:29,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The girl is a rather
small price to pay for that.</font>

840
01:10:30,144 --> 01:10:31,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unlike you, she's impure.</font>

841
01:10:32,104 --> 01:10:33,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She wasn't made by nature.</font>

842
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:35,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a mistake of my own.</font>

843
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:36,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did what I could</font>

844
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:37,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they burned me
and beat me.</font>

845
01:10:37,902 --> 01:10:39,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your colleagues are savages.</font>

846
01:10:40,154 --> 01:10:41,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I agree.</font>

847
01:10:41,655 --> 01:10:43,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Reavers
were very ineffective.</font>

848
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:46,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm bringing
new tools to bear.</font>

849
01:10:46,744 --> 01:10:47,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I still need someone</font>

850
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:48,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to point us
in the right direction.</font>

851
01:10:48,996 --> 01:10:50,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I can't help you.</font>

852
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:52,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Breathe, breathe.</font>

853
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:54,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, what does he have?
The old man.</font>

854
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:56,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alzheimer's? ALS?</font>

855
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:58,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A degenerative brain disease</font>

856
01:10:59,006 --> 01:11:01,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the world's most
dangerous brain?</font>

857
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:03,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a combo.</font>

858
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:08,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Be nice.
Now, you know we got company.</i></font>

859
01:11:08,474 --> 01:11:09,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That's wonderful.</i></font>

860
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:10,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Everybody, have a seat.</i></font>

861
01:11:11,018 --> 01:11:12,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Nate, sit up.</i></font>

862
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:14,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>James, why don't you sit
at the end of the table?</i></font>

863
01:11:14,188 --> 01:11:16,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You wanna say grace?
Say grace, baby.</i></font>

864
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:19,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, thank you, God,
for this food...</font>

865
01:11:20,444 --> 01:11:22,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and for our new friends,
the Howletts.</font>

866
01:11:23,155 --> 01:11:24,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. They came
to our aid.</font>

867
01:11:24,615 --> 01:11:25,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amen.
Amen.</font>

868
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:27,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.
Here you go, Charles.</font>

869
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:29,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.</font>

870
01:11:44,385 --> 01:11:45,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-hmm.</font>

871
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:49,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, there's plenty more
if she wants.</font>

872
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's fine. Thank you.</font>

873
01:11:51,392 --> 01:11:52,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is delicious.</font>

874
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:53,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, thank you.
- It's so good.</font>

875
01:11:53,978 --> 01:11:55,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you all headed?</font>

876
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:56,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Oregon.
South Dakota.</font>

877
01:11:58,732 --> 01:11:59,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

878
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:02,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Oregon
and then South Dakota.</font>

879
01:12:02,403 --> 01:12:03,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vacation?</font>

880
01:12:03,904 --> 01:12:04,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Yes.</font>

881
01:12:05,322 --> 01:12:07,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, long overdue.</font>

882
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:08,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're city folk.</font>

883
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:12,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always wanted to take a road trip,
see the country.</font>

884
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:14,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um... And meet
the people in it.</font>

885
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:16,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That sounds lovely.</font>

886
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:17,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Been trying
to get Will here</font>

887
01:12:17,543 --> 01:12:19,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to take a vacation
for years now.</font>

888
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:20,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. If we go traipsing
all over the country,</font>

889
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:22,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who's gonna take care
of this place?</font>

890
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:23,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly.
I say, let it go.</font>

891
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:25,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And live off what?</font>

892
01:12:25,259 --> 01:12:27,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Lord will provide.</font>

893
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:29,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm still waiting for
the Lord to provide me</font>

894
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:30,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a new thresher.</font>

895
01:12:30,431 --> 01:12:32,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the same,
I'd love to travel someday.</font>

896
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:34,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I bet you will.</font>

897
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:36,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could drop
out of school.</font>

898
01:12:36,437 --> 01:12:37,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's not go
that far.</font>

899
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:38,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I'll do it.</font>

900
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:39,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No. No.
- Why not?</font>

901
01:12:40,107 --> 01:12:41,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna travel,
I wanna travel.</font>

902
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:42,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son. Son.</font>

903
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:44,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That sounds good
to you, right?</font>

904
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:45,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the perfect plan.</font>

905
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:46,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would you want
to do that, Nate?</font>

906
01:12:47,698 --> 01:12:50,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful, you're speaking to
a man who ran a school...</font>

907
01:12:51,702 --> 01:12:53,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for a lot of years.
Right, Charles?</font>

908
01:12:53,746 --> 01:12:55,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it was a...</font>

909
01:12:56,248 --> 01:12:59,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a special needs
school. Um...</font>

910
01:13:00,586 --> 01:13:02,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh.
That's a good description.</font>

911
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was there, too.</font>

912
01:13:04,465 --> 01:13:05,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, no. Um...</font>

913
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:06,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got kicked out a few times.</font>

914
01:13:07,926 --> 01:13:09,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish I could say
you were a good pupil,</font>

915
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:10,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the words
would choke me.</font>

916
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:35,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ma'am, I can't thank you
enough for this.</font>

917
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:37,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, it was great.</font>

918
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:38,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we have a long drive
ahead of us, so...</font>

919
01:13:39,124 --> 01:13:40,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you need to rest,
don't you?</font>

920
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:42,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we'll find
a motel somewhere.</font>

921
01:13:42,086 --> 01:13:43,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The nearest one
is two hours from here</font>

922
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's not even
that nice.</font>

923
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:46,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a perfectly fine
room upstairs</font>

924
01:13:46,632 --> 01:13:47,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for your father
and your daughter and</font>

925
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you can sleep in the living
room on the convertible.</font>

926
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:50,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kathryn, it's very,
very nice of you,</font>

927
01:13:50,803 --> 01:13:52,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we really should go.</font>

928
01:13:52,137 --> 01:13:54,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can leave
early in the morning.</font>

929
01:13:54,473 --> 01:13:57,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Break of dawn,
as it were.</font>

930
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:02,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, why don't we
wash up, Pop?</font>

931
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:03,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

932
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:04,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit.</font>

933
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:10,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, sweetie,
you want some dessert?</font>

934
01:14:10,823 --> 01:14:12,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 days on the road,</font>

935
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:14,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">only one meal,
and hardly any sleep.</font>

936
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:16,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's 11, I'm fucking 90.</font>

937
01:14:16,495 --> 01:14:18,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's 101 reasons
to keep moving.</font>

938
01:14:18,497 --> 01:14:20,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a box
of avocados, Logan.</font>

939
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:22,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then what?
We stay the night, then what?</font>

940
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:25,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we take her to
her friends in Eden.</font>

941
01:14:28,215 --> 01:14:30,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then we buy
the Sunseeker.</font>

942
01:14:32,136 --> 01:14:33,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take the pills.</font>

943
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:38,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit!</font>

944
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:42,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?
Nate!</font>

945
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:44,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go fill up the tub
before we lose pressure.</font>

946
01:14:44,398 --> 01:14:45,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, check the sink.</font>

947
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:47,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They shut it off again.</font>

948
01:14:47,985 --> 01:14:49,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are just not going to
let this thing go.</font>

949
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:51,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you might as well
handle it now.</font>

950
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:53,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can wait till the morning.
We just had rain last night.</font>

951
01:14:53,157 --> 01:14:54,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got 3 houseguests</font>

952
01:14:54,575 --> 01:14:55,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a sink full of dishes.</font>

953
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:57,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, all right.</font>

954
01:14:58,245 --> 01:14:59,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The pump station
that supplies us</font>

955
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:00,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a mile
and a half from here.</font>

956
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:02,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes it gets itself
shut off.</font>

957
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- By assholes.
- Hey!</font>

958
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:05,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

959
01:15:05,586 --> 01:15:07,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My son is happy
to go with you.</font>

960
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:09,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no,
that's fine.</font>

961
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:11,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The men that do this,
sometimes they can be...</font>

962
01:15:11,592 --> 01:15:13,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can go.
No, you got homework.</font>

963
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:15,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I'll go.</font>

964
01:15:15,179 --> 01:15:16,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just, uh,
let me get my dad settled.</font>

965
01:15:20,726 --> 01:15:21,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

966
01:15:23,395 --> 01:15:25,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just saying,
I don't care what the lawyer says.</font>

967
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:29,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's dangerous.</font>

968
01:15:29,902 --> 01:15:31,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna hurt
our chances.</font>

969
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:46,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want TV? There's TV here.</font>

970
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:47,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine.</font>

971
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Get some rest.</font>

972
01:15:49,129 --> 01:15:51,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Logan...</font>

973
01:15:51,715 --> 01:15:53,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is what life
looks like.</font>

974
01:15:54,301 --> 01:15:56,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A home,
people who love each other.</font>

975
01:15:57,095 --> 01:15:58,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Safe place.</font>

976
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:00,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should
take a moment and feel it.</font>

977
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:05,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. It's great.</font>

978
01:16:05,938 --> 01:16:07,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan. Logan!</font>

979
01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:11,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still have time.</font>

980
01:16:14,112 --> 01:16:18,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles, the world is not
the same as it was.</font>

981
01:16:20,661 --> 01:16:23,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're taking a risk hanging
around here, you know that.</font>

982
01:16:23,914 --> 01:16:26,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And where
we're going, Eden...</font>

983
01:16:27,459 --> 01:16:28,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it doesn't exist.</font>

984
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:31,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her nurse got it
from a comic book.</font>

985
01:16:33,799 --> 01:16:36,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand?
It's not real.</font>

986
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:38,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is for Laura.</font>

987
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:45,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is for Laura.</font>

988
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:49,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get some rest.</font>

989
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:54,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Canewood Beverage bought up
everything out here,</font>

990
01:16:55,028 --> 01:16:56,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">except for us.</font>

991
01:16:56,363 --> 01:16:58,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we wouldn't sell,
they tried eminent domain...</font>

992
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:00,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then screwing
with our water.</font>

993
01:17:01,785 --> 01:17:04,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Couple of months ago,
somebody poisoned our dogs.</font>

994
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:07,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, out on the highway
today, those trucks...</font>

995
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who knows. Maybe.</font>

996
01:17:11,378 --> 01:17:13,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, look at 'em.</font>

997
01:17:13,964 --> 01:17:15,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look like dinosaurs
with their 20-ton bodies</font>

998
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:17,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and tiny little brains...</font>

999
01:17:17,384 --> 01:17:19,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shucking their cloned-up
super corn.</font>

1000
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know it tastes
like shit, too.</font>

1001
01:17:21,138 --> 01:17:22,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do people eat it?</font>

1002
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:24,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't. They drink it.
Corn syrup.</font>

1003
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:26,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in those drinks
that everyone's having...</font>

1004
01:17:26,977 --> 01:17:30,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to stay awake, cheer up,
feel strong, sexy, whatever.</font>

1005
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:33,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Used to be a time when a bad
day was just a bad day.</font>

1006
01:17:33,734 --> 01:17:35,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mine still are.</font>

1007
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are for
breakaway roping.</font>

1008
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:02,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are for
barrel racing...</font>

1009
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:04,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and right here
is for pole bending.</font>

1010
01:18:05,098 --> 01:18:06,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're all second,
third place.</font>

1011
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not too good at it,
but my dad makes me.</font>

1012
01:18:19,446 --> 01:18:21,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want to listen?</font>

1013
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:32,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you like it?</font>

1014
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:39,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, here, you can
take it for tonight...</font>

1015
01:18:39,257 --> 01:18:42,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll get it back
from you in the morning.</font>

1016
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:57,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like we're gonna
be here a while.</font>

1017
01:19:30,684 --> 01:19:31,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should hold it.</font>

1018
01:19:32,144 --> 01:19:33,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1019
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Till next time.</font>

1020
01:19:35,689 --> 01:19:36,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

1021
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:41,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, so, uh,
how long has your girl</font>

1022
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:42,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">been like that?
Huh?</font>

1023
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:44,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mute.</font>

1024
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:48,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, since the beginning.</font>

1025
01:19:49,035 --> 01:19:50,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

1026
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, in a lot of ways,
I envy you.</font>

1027
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:54,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They get to be Nate's age,</font>

1028
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:57,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the nonsense that comes
out of their mouths...</font>

1029
01:19:57,961 --> 01:20:00,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes you wonder the
whole point of it all.</font>

1030
01:20:02,674 --> 01:20:04,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

1031
01:20:08,388 --> 01:20:09,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry.</font>

1032
01:20:09,556 --> 01:20:11,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We won't need it.</font>

1033
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:12,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay here.</font>

1034
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Evening, Mr. Munson.</font>

1035
01:20:21,735 --> 01:20:22,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What brings y'all
this way?</font>

1036
01:20:23,904 --> 01:20:25,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you ask
your boys?</font>

1037
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:26,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Munson,</font>

1038
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you understand you're
trespassing right now, right?</font>

1039
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:30,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an easement with
the previous owner</font>

1040
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:31,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of your property.</font>

1041
01:20:31,161 --> 01:20:32,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh. Bullshit.</font>

1042
01:20:32,662 --> 01:20:34,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Previous" being
the operative word.</font>

1043
01:20:35,874 --> 01:20:37,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's this?</font>

1044
01:20:38,418 --> 01:20:39,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a guy telling you</font>

1045
01:20:39,544 --> 01:20:40,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to get back
in your nice truck.</font>

1046
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:43,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go play Okie dickhead
somewhere else.</font>

1047
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Carl...</font>

1048
01:20:50,013 --> 01:20:53,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it looks like Mr. Munson
hired some muscle.</font>

1049
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:54,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks that way.</font>

1050
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:56,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a friend of mine.</font>

1051
01:20:56,436 --> 01:20:58,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A friend with a big mouth.</font>

1052
01:20:58,438 --> 01:20:59,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear that a lot.</font>

1053
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:01,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you probably
hear this, too.</font>

1054
01:21:04,069 --> 01:21:05,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More than I'd like.</font>

1055
01:21:05,779 --> 01:21:06,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you know the drill.</font>

1056
01:21:08,114 --> 01:21:09,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'mma count to three...</font>

1057
01:21:10,116 --> 01:21:11,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're gonna
start walking away.</font>

1058
01:21:11,618 --> 01:21:12,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got rights
to this water.</font>

1059
01:21:12,702 --> 01:21:13,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1.
I have a lawyer now.</font>

1060
01:21:13,954 --> 01:21:14,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2.</font>

1061
01:21:16,623 --> 01:21:18,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3.
Ah. Ah.</font>

1062
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right, boss?</font>

1063
01:21:22,295 --> 01:21:24,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know the drill.
- Pick up my goddamn hat.</font>

1064
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the hell out of here.</font>

1065
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:27,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay, boss?
Fuck off.</font>

1066
01:21:27,217 --> 01:21:28,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

1067
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:46,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've had training.</font>

1068
01:21:47,237 --> 01:21:48,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some.</font>

1069
01:22:08,008 --> 01:22:10,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, don't wake her yet.</font>

1070
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:12,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let her sleep another hour.</font>

1071
01:22:17,267 --> 01:22:19,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Logan...</font>

1072
01:22:20,687 --> 01:22:23,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this was, without a doubt...</font>

1073
01:22:24,816 --> 01:22:29,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the most perfect night
I've had in a very long time.</font>

1074
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:39,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't deserve it.</font>

1075
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I?</font>

1076
01:22:46,463 --> 01:22:48,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did something.</font>

1077
01:22:51,468 --> 01:22:53,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something unspeakable.</font>

1078
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:03,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've remembered
what happened in Westchester.</font>

1079
01:23:08,026 --> 01:23:11,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not the first time
I've hurt people.</font>

1080
01:23:13,365 --> 01:23:16,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until today, I didn't know.</font>

1081
01:23:17,577 --> 01:23:19,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wouldn't tell me.</font>

1082
01:23:21,748 --> 01:23:27,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we just kept on
running away from it.</font>

1083
01:23:32,175 --> 01:23:35,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I finally
understand you.</font>

1084
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:40,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Logan...</font>

1085
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:09,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's fantastic.</font>

1086
01:24:09,796 --> 01:24:11,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you only needed
the girl!</font>

1087
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:13,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you I was forced
to bring a new tool to bear.</font>

1088
01:24:13,591 --> 01:24:14,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your friends
had every chance.</font>

1089
01:24:14,968 --> 01:24:16,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so did you.</font>

1090
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:18,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nate?</font>

1091
01:24:22,142 --> 01:24:23,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put her down.</font>

1092
01:24:31,943 --> 01:24:32,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey.</font>

1093
01:24:33,486 --> 01:24:35,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay down there, Will!</font>

1094
01:24:37,449 --> 01:24:38,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

1095
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:40,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kathryn!</font>

1096
01:24:41,411 --> 01:24:42,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kathryn!</font>

1097
01:24:42,662 --> 01:24:44,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kathryn!</font>

1098

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles!</font>

1099
01:25:14,611 --> 01:25:15,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles!</font>

1100
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:30,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold this.</font>

1101
01:25:30,293 --> 01:25:32,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.</font>

1102
01:25:35,048 --> 01:25:36,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here he comes.</font>

1103
01:25:36,966 --> 01:25:38,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could pick him up,</font>

1104
01:25:38,218 --> 01:25:39,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">meet him halfway.</font>

1105
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:40,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.
Let them come to us.</font>

1106
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:43,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We struggled
with the X-23s.</font>

1107
01:25:43,306 --> 01:25:44,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We assumed,
because they were children...</font>

1108
01:25:44,557 --> 01:25:45,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we could raise them
without a conscience.</font>

1109
01:25:46,017 --> 01:25:47,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can't nurture rage.</font>

1110
01:25:48,061 --> 01:25:49,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must simply design it...</font>

1111
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:50,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from scratch.</font>

1112

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the fuck is that?</font>

1113
01:26:05,328 --> 01:26:06,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will Munson!</font>

1114
01:26:09,749 --> 01:26:11,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just hold on, Charles.</font>

1115
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:13,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Munson,
God damn it, come out here!</font>

1116
01:26:18,258 --> 01:26:19,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Munson!</font>

1117
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:22,430

1121
01:26:29,727 --> 01:26:32,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I'm willing
to let bygones be bygones.</font>

1122
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:34,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what
Munson's paying you...</font>

1123
01:26:35,358 --> 01:26:37,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but Canewood can start
you out at 5 G.</font>

1124
01:26:38,069 --> 01:26:39,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A week, that is.</font>

1125
01:26:41,364 --> 01:26:43,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You best stay
where you are, pal.</font>

1126
01:26:43,533 --> 01:26:45,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the law out here.</font>

1127
01:26:46,119 --> 01:26:47,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.</font>

1128
01:26:49,247 --> 01:26:50,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What in high...</font>

1129
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:53,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Oh, shit!</font>

1130
01:26:54,043 --> 01:26:55,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoot him!</font>

1131
01:26:57,046 --> 01:26:58,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to intervene.</font>

1132
01:26:58,298 --> 01:27:00,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he only listens
to you, Doctor.</font>

1133
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:04,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">24!</font>

1134
01:27:05,889 --> 01:27:06,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back here!</font>

1135
01:27:07,974 --> 01:27:09,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop! Stop now!</font>

1136
01:27:09,309 --> 01:27:11,139

right now, tight!</font>

1137
01:27:15,565 --> 01:27:17,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our boat.
What?</font>

1138
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:24,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Sunseeker.</font>

1139
01:27:34,584 --> 01:27:35,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1140
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:45,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come!</font>

1141
01:27:45,678 --> 01:27:46,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">24!</font>

1142
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Need some help
out here!</font>

1143
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:51,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess we're gonna have to
take care of this now.</font>

1144
01:27:51,643 --> 01:27:53,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pierce!
- Give me that.</font>

1145
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:54,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your lily-faced
ass out here!</font>

1146
01:28:01,194 --> 01:28:02,364

1147
01:28:02,528 --> 01:28:04,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck
do you think you're doing?</font>

1148
01:28:04,197 --> 01:28:06,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right,
we gotta go around that truck</font>

1149
01:28:06,199 --> 01:28:07,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and flank them farmers.</font>

1150
01:28:07,659 --> 01:28:08,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow my lead.</font>

1151
01:28:09,035 --> 01:28:10,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring extra ammo,
take these clips.</font>

1152
01:28:11,037 --> 01:28:12,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come!</font>

1153
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:13,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now!</font>

1154
01:28:14,374 --> 01:28:15,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pick her up.</font>

1155
01:28:26,552 --> 01:28:27,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beware the light.</font>

1156
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:52,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell are you?</font>

1157
01:31:19,308 --> 01:31:20,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit down.</font>

1158
01:31:39,871 --> 01:31:41,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold still.</font>

1159
01:31:41,581 --> 01:31:42,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold still.</font>

1160
01:32:04,937 --> 01:32:06,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him on the truck.</font>

1161
01:32:06,105 --> 01:32:07,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1162
01:32:08,774 --> 01:32:10,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>

1163
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:17,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right,
it's all right.</font>

1164
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:20,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.
You did fine, 24.</font>

1165
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:22,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're healing.
Just breathe.</font>

1166
01:32:24,123 --> 01:32:26,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a newborn,
by any measure.</font>

1167
01:32:26,792 --> 01:32:28,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just breathe.</font>

1168
01:32:28,419 --> 01:32:29,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your body has work to do.</font>

1169
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:32,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hemostasis, angiogenesis,
epithelialization...</font>

1170
01:32:32,423 --> 01:32:33,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">stromal cell proliferation.</font>

1171
01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:37,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This will help you heal.</font>

1172
01:32:38,304 --> 01:32:39,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make you stronger.</font>

1173
01:33:34,902 --> 01:33:36,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

1174
01:33:42,034 --> 01:33:43,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's got water, and...</font>

1175
01:34:06,892 --> 01:34:08,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's got water.</font>

1176
01:34:26,078 --> 01:34:27,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck this. Fuck this.</font>

1177
01:34:40,843 --> 01:34:42,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God!</font>

1178
01:34:48,309 --> 01:34:50,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck! Fuck!</font>

1179
01:34:50,227 --> 01:34:51,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck!</font>

1180
01:34:51,937 --> 01:34:52,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

1181
01:35:05,618 --> 01:35:06,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck! Fuck!</font>

1182
01:35:08,579 --> 01:35:10,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck!</font>

1183
01:35:10,289 --> 01:35:11,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Motherfucking...</font>

1184
01:35:16,253 --> 01:35:17,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

1185
01:35:18,464 --> 01:35:20,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck! Fuck!</font>

1186
01:35:48,369 --> 01:35:49,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome back.</font>

1187
01:35:50,621 --> 01:35:52,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was starting to think
I was gonna have to tell...</font>

1188
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:54,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that nice little girl
out in the waiting room...</font>

1189
01:35:54,542 --> 01:35:56,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">her daddy's gone.</font>

1190
01:36:02,174 --> 01:36:03,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd always hoped...</font>

1191
01:36:04,176 --> 01:36:08,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I'd get the chance
to meet someone like you.</font>

1192
01:36:09,014 --> 01:36:10,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's so few of you left.</font>

1193
01:36:13,185 --> 01:36:15,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to meet you, too, Doc.</font>

1194
01:36:15,521 --> 01:36:16,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I really
got to get on my way.</font>

1195
01:36:16,856 --> 01:36:18,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, don't do that.</font>

1196
01:36:18,232 --> 01:36:20,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you need is rest,
and treatment.</font>

1197
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:22,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to check yourself
in somewhere.</font>

1198
01:36:22,403 --> 01:36:23,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be fine.</font>

1199
01:36:23,696 --> 01:36:24,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you're not!</font>

1200
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:28,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I know
that you're different...</font>

1201
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:29,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that doesn't
change the fact</font>

1202
01:36:29,493 --> 01:36:31,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that something inside you
is poisoning you.</font>

1203
01:36:31,662 --> 01:36:33,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got to check yourself
into a hospital.</font>

1204
01:36:34,039 --> 01:36:35,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find out what it is!</font>

1205
01:36:36,167 --> 01:36:37,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what it is.</font>

1206
01:36:38,252 --> 01:36:40,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, mister, if you don't
want to go to a hospital,</font>

1207
01:36:40,588 --> 01:36:41,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe I can help you.</font>

1208
01:36:41,755 --> 01:36:43,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I can run
some tests.</font>

1209
01:36:43,174 --> 01:36:45,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Doc. You seem
like a nice guy, all right?</font>

1210
01:36:45,718 --> 01:36:47,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna save a life,
save your own.</font>

1211
01:36:47,553 --> 01:36:48,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forget we were here.</font>

1212
01:36:48,762 --> 01:36:49,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

1213
01:37:01,025 --> 01:37:02,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1214
01:37:02,568 --> 01:37:03,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1215
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:26,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't just take shit,
you know.</font>

1216
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:46,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know
how you got me here...</font>

1217
01:37:47,613 --> 01:37:48,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but thank you.</font>

1218
01:37:48,864 --> 01:37:49,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>De nada.</i></font>

1219
01:37:50,074 --> 01:37:51,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1220
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:54,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can talk?</font>

1221
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:57,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can talk?</font>

1222
01:37:58,666 --> 01:38:00,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?</font>

1223
01:38:00,626 --> 01:38:01,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why in the fuck...</font>

1224
01:38:01,919 --> 01:38:02,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's all this
bullshit been</font>

1225
01:38:02,962 --> 01:38:04,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the last
2,000 fucking miles?</font>

1226
01:38:07,925 --> 01:38:09,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Shut up.</font>

1227
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:10,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut the fuck up!</font>

1228
01:38:11,011 --> 01:38:13,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jonah, Gideon,
Rebecca, Delilah, Rictor.</font>

1229
01:38:13,806 --> 01:38:16,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Who's that?</font>

1230
01:38:16,267 --> 01:38:17,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is that?</font>

1231
01:38:18,811 --> 01:38:22,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca,
Delilah, and Rictor.</font>

1232
01:38:22,856 --> 01:38:23,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">North Dakota.</font>

1233
01:38:24,858 --> 01:38:26,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1234
01:38:26,277 --> 01:38:27,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">North Dakota, <i>por favor.</i></font>

1235
01:38:27,778 --> 01:38:28,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, okay. Look...</font>

1236
01:38:29,029 --> 01:38:30,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No. Por favor.</i></font>

1237
01:38:31,824 --> 01:38:33,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This place. Okay?</font>

1238
01:38:33,659 --> 01:38:34,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your nurse,</font>

1239
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:37,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she read too many stories,
you understand?</font>

1240
01:38:37,329 --> 01:38:38,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too many stories!</font>

1241
01:38:42,710 --> 01:38:45,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've seen it!
I've seen it, okay?</font>

1242
01:38:45,671 --> 01:38:46,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This all here...</font>

1243
01:38:46,964 --> 01:38:48,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of this...
No <i>existo,</i> okay?</font>

1244
01:38:49,049 --> 01:38:50,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand me?</font>

1245
01:38:50,217 --> 01:38:51,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This Eden
does not exist. No!</font>

1246
01:38:51,677 --> 01:38:52,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Si! Eden!<i></font>

1247
01:38:53,137 --> 01:38:54,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a fantasy, kid.
See that?</font>

1248
01:38:55,139 --> 01:38:56,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are the names
of the people</font>

1249
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:57,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who just made this...</font>

1250
01:38:58,058 --> 01:38:59,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They made this
whole thing up.</font>

1251
01:39:00,352 --> 01:39:01,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? This whole...</font>

1252
01:39:01,812 --> 01:39:02,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It happened once,</font>

1253
01:39:02,855 --> 01:39:04,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they just turned it
into a big, fucking lie!</font>

1254
01:39:06,066 --> 01:39:07,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all this is. No!</font>

1255
01:39:07,901 --> 01:39:09,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

1256
01:39:09,862 --> 01:39:10,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1257
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:13,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, I understand.</font>

1258
01:39:13,741 --> 01:39:15,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a long way.</font>

1259
01:39:15,826 --> 01:39:16,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand?</font>

1260
01:39:16,869 --> 01:39:19,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not taking you
to North Dakota.</font>

1261
01:39:22,416 --> 01:39:25,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am fucked up.
And I cannot get you there.</font>

1262
01:39:25,878 --> 01:39:29,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a 2-day drive.
And I am not taking you...</font>

1263
01:39:29,173 --> 01:39:31,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't fucking hit me!</font>

1264
01:39:32,051 --> 01:39:33,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't hit me!</font>

1265
01:39:33,886 --> 01:39:35,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jonah, Gideon...</font>

1266
01:39:35,179 --> 01:39:36,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop saying those names.
...Rebecca...</font>

1267
01:39:36,347 --> 01:39:37,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Delilah, Rictor.</font>

1268
01:39:37,431 --> 01:39:38,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now.
Stop saying those names.</font>

1269
01:39:39,058 --> 01:39:40,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it! Stop!</font>

1270
01:39:40,351 --> 01:39:41,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca...</font>

1271
01:39:41,685 --> 01:39:44,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck it. Fine, fine.</font>

1272
01:39:44,521 --> 01:39:46,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna go?</font>

1273
01:39:46,273 --> 01:39:48,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take you there.</font>

1274
01:39:48,567 --> 01:39:50,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See for yourself.</font>

1275
01:39:50,402 --> 01:39:52,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go to
fucking fantasyland.</font>

1276
01:40:05,584 --> 01:40:06,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We understand
the importance</i></font>

1277
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:07,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>of containment, Dr. Rice.</i></font>

1278
01:40:08,253 --> 01:40:09,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can't leave
a war zone behind</font>

1279
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:10,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like you did in Juarez.</font>

1280
01:40:10,589 --> 01:40:11,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, try to
remind yourselves</font>

1281
01:40:11,799 --> 01:40:13,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that these are all
little killing machines.</font>

1282
01:40:13,217 --> 01:40:15,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Machines who would've happily
disemboweled your family.</font>

1283
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:16,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not all.</font>

1284
01:40:17,429 --> 01:40:19,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was told you want
these assets off-board,</font>

1285
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:20,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">dead or alive.</font>

1286
01:40:20,641 --> 01:40:21,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you changing my brief?</font>

1287
01:40:22,059 --> 01:40:23,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1288
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:24,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, then.</font>

1289
01:40:26,438 --> 01:40:27,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Save tissue from this one.</font>

1290
01:40:27,731 --> 01:40:29,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a good tracker
and had a high IQ.</font>

1291
01:40:35,239 --> 01:40:36,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you go.</font>

1292
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1293
01:41:22,161 --> 01:41:23,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

1294
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:24,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me drive.</font>

1295
01:41:27,291 --> 01:41:28,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely not.</font>

1296
01:41:34,298 --> 01:41:35,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quit looking at me.</font>

1297
01:41:40,262 --> 01:41:41,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No comprende.</i></font>

1298
01:41:43,015 --> 01:41:44,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are dying.</font>

1299
01:41:47,394 --> 01:41:48,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to die.</font>

1300
01:41:51,732 --> 01:41:53,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles told me.</font>

1301
01:41:56,361 --> 01:41:58,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What else did he tell you?</font>

1302
01:41:59,031 --> 01:42:00,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To not let you.</font>

1303
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:14,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, hey!</font>

1304
01:42:21,762 --> 01:42:22,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rest.</font>

1305
01:45:07,344 --> 01:45:08,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep it steady.</font>

1306
01:45:11,181 --> 01:45:12,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Swing him toward me.</font>

1307
01:45:15,268 --> 01:45:16,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1308
01:45:18,855 --> 01:45:21,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy. Easy</font>

1309
01:45:54,266 --> 01:45:55,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this good, Rictor?</font>

1310
01:45:56,435 --> 01:45:57,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not so much. Less.</font>

1311
01:46:03,942 --> 01:46:05,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1312
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:13,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where am I?</font>

1313
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:16,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what is it?</font>

1314
01:46:17,164 --> 01:46:18,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did you get that?</font>

1315
01:46:18,623 --> 01:46:19,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where we came from.</font>

1316
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:21,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They gave it to us</font>

1317
01:46:21,668 --> 01:46:22,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when we would fight.
It makes you stronger.</font>

1318
01:46:22,836 --> 01:46:24,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It makes you crazy,
is what it does.</font>

1319
01:46:24,755 --> 01:46:25,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll kill you.</font>

1320
01:46:25,839 --> 01:46:27,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not if you use it
in small doses.</font>

1321
01:46:28,508 --> 01:46:29,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's helping you heal.</font>

1322
01:46:31,303 --> 01:46:32,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Laura?</font>

1323
01:46:32,804 --> 01:46:34,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's asleep down there.</font>

1324
01:46:34,931 --> 01:46:36,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want me
to wake her up?</font>

1325
01:46:44,441 --> 01:46:45,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1326
01:47:06,838 --> 01:47:08,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had a nightmare.</font>

1327
01:47:12,385 --> 01:47:14,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have nightmares?</font>

1328
01:47:15,472 --> 01:47:16,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Si.</i></font>

1329
01:47:19,559 --> 01:47:21,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People hurt me.</font>

1330
01:47:23,355 --> 01:47:24,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mine are different.</font>

1331
01:47:31,029 --> 01:47:32,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hurt people.</font>

1332
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:51,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what it is.</font>

1333
01:47:53,718 --> 01:47:55,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's made
out of Adamantium.</font>

1334
01:47:56,388 --> 01:47:58,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's what they put
inside of us.</font>

1335
01:47:59,558 --> 01:48:01,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why it can kill us.</font>

1336
01:48:03,186 --> 01:48:05,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably what is
killing me now.</font>

1337
01:48:07,566 --> 01:48:08,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway...</font>

1338
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:11,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got this
a long time ago...</font>

1339
01:48:12,571 --> 01:48:16,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I kept it as a reminder
of what I am.</font>

1340
01:48:18,285 --> 01:48:20,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I keep it to, uh...</font>

1341
01:48:27,127 --> 01:48:28,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, uh...</font>

1342
01:48:31,882 --> 01:48:34,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was thinking of
shooting myself with it.</font>

1343
01:48:34,759 --> 01:48:36,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Charles said.</font>

1344
01:48:41,975 --> 01:48:43,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've hurt people, too.</font>

1345
01:48:46,938 --> 01:48:49,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna have to learn
how to live with that.</font>

1346
01:48:59,326 --> 01:49:01,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were bad people.</font>

1347
01:49:05,123 --> 01:49:06,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the same.</font>

1348
01:50:21,825 --> 01:50:24,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not funny.
That is not funny!</font>

1349
01:50:25,704 --> 01:50:27,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Hey, pal.</font>

1350
01:50:27,205 --> 01:50:29,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long have I been out?</font>

1351
01:50:31,167 --> 01:50:32,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long have I been
in that bed?</font>

1352
01:50:32,544 --> 01:50:33,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two days.</font>

1353
01:50:34,004 --> 01:50:35,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've been sitting here
for two days?</font>

1354
01:50:35,338 --> 01:50:36,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, go inside and tell
everyone to get packing.</font>

1355
01:50:36,923 --> 01:50:38,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't do that.
You can't just stay here.</font>

1356
01:50:38,675 --> 01:50:40,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had to wait.
It was the plan.</font>

1357
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:43,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And everyone had till today
to find their way here.</font>

1358
01:50:43,221 --> 01:50:44,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you keep waiting,</font>

1359
01:50:44,264 --> 01:50:45,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alkali will find you
and they will kill you all.</font>

1360
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:46,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to get out!</font>

1361
01:50:47,017 --> 01:50:49,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're leaving tomorrow
before dawn.</font>

1362
01:50:49,519 --> 01:50:51,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna cross
the border.</font>

1363
01:50:51,271 --> 01:50:52,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a safe haven.</font>

1364
01:50:54,107 --> 01:50:55,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same coordinates?</font>

1365
01:50:55,525 --> 01:50:57,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yes, between noon and 5:00.</i></font>

1366
01:50:57,902 --> 01:51:00,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Satellites are blind then.</i></font>

1367
01:51:00,405 --> 01:51:01,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Your asylum approved.</i></font>

1368
01:51:01,614 --> 01:51:02,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Copy.</font>

1369
01:51:18,757 --> 01:51:20,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Swing it
to your right, Laura.</font>

1370
01:51:23,928 --> 01:51:25,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little more. Yeah.</font>

1371
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:27,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see the woods?</font>

1372
01:51:29,392 --> 01:51:30,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Si.</i></font>

1373
01:51:31,061 --> 01:51:32,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an 8 mile hike
through there.</font>

1374
01:51:33,646 --> 01:51:34,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you see that pass?</font>

1375
01:51:34,939 --> 01:51:36,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-hmm.</font>

1376
01:51:36,274 --> 01:51:37,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the border.</font>

1377
01:51:39,277 --> 01:51:41,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's where
we will be safe.</font>

1378
01:51:48,411 --> 01:51:49,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come inside.</font>

1379
01:51:56,795 --> 01:51:58,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laura told me
all that you did for her.</font>

1380
01:51:58,797 --> 01:52:00,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was lucky to have you.</font>

1381
01:52:03,301 --> 01:52:05,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it.
She says it's yours.</font>

1382
01:52:07,138 --> 01:52:09,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why
you did it, right?</font>

1383
01:52:11,935 --> 01:52:13,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well...</font>

1384
01:52:14,479 --> 01:52:17,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I don't need it.
You do, okay?</font>

1385
01:52:17,649 --> 01:52:19,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suit yourself.</font>

1386
01:52:40,964 --> 01:52:42,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your friends,
they seem nice.</font>

1387
01:52:42,799 --> 01:52:43,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kind of reminds me...</font>

1388
01:52:45,510 --> 01:52:46,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey,
what's going on?</font>

1389
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:48,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1390
01:52:50,014 --> 01:52:51,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're with your pals.
You made it.</font>

1391
01:52:52,392 --> 01:52:53,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where will you go?</font>

1392
01:52:55,019 --> 01:52:56,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nearest bar, for starters.</font>

1393
01:52:57,856 --> 01:53:00,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I got you here.
That's all I signed up for.</font>

1394
01:53:00,483 --> 01:53:02,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I even gave back
the money.</font>

1395
01:53:02,527 --> 01:53:03,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Such a nice man.</font>

1396
01:53:03,695 --> 01:53:05,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I never asked
for this!</font>

1397
01:53:06,573 --> 01:53:08,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right?
Charles never asked for this.</font>

1398
01:53:08,533 --> 01:53:10,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Caliban never asked for this.</font>

1399
01:53:11,202 --> 01:53:13,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they are 6 feet
under the ground!</font>

1400
01:53:14,372 --> 01:53:16,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I don't know what
Charles put in your head...</font>

1401
01:53:16,541 --> 01:53:19,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I am not whatever it is
you think I am, okay?</font>

1402
01:53:20,712 --> 01:53:23,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only met you,
like, a week ago.</font>

1403
01:53:24,215 --> 01:53:26,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got your Rebecca,
your Delilah...</font>

1404
01:53:26,342 --> 01:53:28,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your blah, blah, blah,
whatever.</font>

1405
01:53:28,219 --> 01:53:29,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything you asked for,
you've got it!</font>

1406
01:53:32,891 --> 01:53:34,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it is better this way.</font>

1407
01:53:36,227 --> 01:53:38,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I suck at this.</font>

1408
01:53:39,898 --> 01:53:43,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad shit happens to people
I care about.</font>

1409
01:53:43,193 --> 01:53:44,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand me?</font>

1410
01:53:46,946 --> 01:53:48,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I'll be fine.</font>

1411
01:55:56,451 --> 01:55:59,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!
Towards the mountains! Run!</font>

1412
01:57:09,482 --> 01:57:10,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run, Bobby, run!</font>

1413
01:57:15,947 --> 01:57:16,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

1414
01:57:34,882 --> 01:57:36,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Go!</font>

1415
01:57:37,009 --> 01:57:38,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move faster!</font>

1416
01:57:38,177 --> 01:57:40,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to reach them before
they get to the border.</font>

1417
01:58:57,089 --> 01:58:58,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move out!</font>

1418
01:58:58,508 --> 01:58:59,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, let's go!</font>

1419
01:59:01,344 --> 01:59:02,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run! Run!</font>

1420
01:59:02,970 --> 01:59:05,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Corre, Jonah! Run!<i></font>

1421
01:59:12,146 --> 01:59:13,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to breathe.</font>

1422
01:59:13,856 --> 01:59:15,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just
a flesh wound, baby.</font>

1423
01:59:31,415 --> 01:59:32,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There she is.</font>

1424
01:59:32,625 --> 01:59:33,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got her.</font>

1425
01:59:36,379 --> 01:59:38,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back it up! Contain her.</font>

1426
02:00:05,074 --> 02:00:06,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get behind me!</font>

1427
02:00:27,638 --> 02:00:29,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You took all the medicine.</font>

1428
02:00:31,017 --> 02:00:32,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's wearing off.</font>

1429
02:00:59,003 --> 02:01:00,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to your friends.</font>

1430
02:01:01,589 --> 02:01:02,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>

1431
02:01:04,091 --> 02:01:05,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laura?</font>

1432
02:01:07,219 --> 02:01:08,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll know when.</font>

1433
02:01:20,691 --> 02:01:21,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">9 o'clock.</font>

1434
02:01:23,986 --> 02:01:26,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That green juice
is wearin' off, huh?</font>

1435
02:01:27,239 --> 02:01:29,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, for an old mute,
it's kind of a short high.</font>

1436
02:01:30,242 --> 02:01:31,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be hard to
keep them claws out, soon.</font>

1437
02:01:31,953 --> 02:01:33,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Waste this dick, Logan!</font>

1438
02:01:35,039 --> 02:01:36,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please stop,
Mr. Howlett.</font>

1439
02:01:37,208 --> 02:01:38,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna have to
tell these men</font>

1440
02:01:38,334 --> 02:01:39,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to fire
on these children.</font>

1441
02:01:39,543 --> 02:01:40,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want that.</font>

1442
02:01:41,045 --> 02:01:43,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can see the effects of
the serum are wearing off.</font>

1443
02:01:43,547 --> 02:01:46,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will not survive
further wounds.</font>

1444
02:01:46,384 --> 02:01:47,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow me to
introduce myself.</font>

1445
02:01:48,302 --> 02:01:49,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Zander Rice.</font>

1446
02:01:50,471 --> 02:01:52,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe you knew my father
on the Weapon X Program.</font>

1447
02:01:52,723 --> 02:01:56,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. He's the asshole
who put this poison in me.</font>

1448
02:01:57,311 --> 02:01:58,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, he was one of them.</font>

1449
02:02:00,189 --> 02:02:01,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think
I might have killed him.</font>

1450
02:02:03,275 --> 02:02:04,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you're right.</font>

1451
02:02:04,485 --> 02:02:06,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you show
some respect, mutie?</font>

1452
02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:08,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're lookin' at the man
who wiped out your kind.</font>

1453
02:02:08,614 --> 02:02:10,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friend Donald overstates.</font>

1454
02:02:11,575 --> 02:02:14,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He makes it sound more brutal
than intended.</font>

1455
02:02:14,453 --> 02:02:17,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The goal was
not to end mutant kind...</font>

1456
02:02:17,873 --> 02:02:19,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but to control it.</font>

1457
02:02:21,293 --> 02:02:22,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I realized</font>

1458
02:02:22,503 --> 02:02:24,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we needn't stop perfecting
what we eat and drink.</font>

1459
02:02:24,171 --> 02:02:25,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That we could use
those products</font>

1460
02:02:25,256 --> 02:02:26,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to perfect ourselves.</font>

1461
02:02:27,425 --> 02:02:28,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To distribute gene therapy</font>

1462
02:02:28,801 --> 02:02:30,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">discreetly
through everything...</font>

1463
02:02:30,302 --> 02:02:32,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from sweet drinks
to breakfast cereals.</font>

1464
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:33,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it worked.</font>

1465
02:02:33,973 --> 02:02:36,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Random mutancy
went the way of polio.</font>

1466
02:02:36,642 --> 02:02:37,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We embarked
on our next endeavor.</font>

1467
02:02:38,144 --> 02:02:39,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Growing mutants of your own.</font>

1468
02:02:39,937 --> 02:02:40,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Precisely.
Dangerous times, James.</font>

1469
02:02:41,022 --> 02:02:42,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't...</font>

1470
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:43,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Argh!</font>

1471
02:02:44,525 --> 02:02:45,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Argh!</font>

1472
02:03:01,042 --> 02:03:02,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Showtime, boy!</font>

1473
02:03:38,746 --> 02:03:40,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up, boy.
Get up, boy!</font>

1474
02:03:45,544 --> 02:03:46,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He did that. Get up!</font>

1475
02:04:00,101 --> 02:04:01,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laura! No!</font>

1476
02:04:06,816 --> 02:04:07,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laura!</font>

1477
02:04:55,281 --> 02:04:56,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

1478
02:05:31,192 --> 02:05:32,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

1479
02:05:39,742 --> 02:05:40,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>

1480
02:05:42,578 --> 02:05:43,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

1481
02:05:44,121 --> 02:05:45,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>

1482
02:05:46,582 --> 02:05:48,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go!</font>

1483
02:05:48,792 --> 02:05:51,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Get out of here! Go!</font>

1484
02:05:54,715 --> 02:05:56,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Go, go, go!</font>

1485
02:06:01,263 --> 02:06:02,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go!</font>

1486
02:06:02,890 --> 02:06:03,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

1487
02:06:04,308 --> 02:06:05,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>

1488
02:06:05,559 --> 02:06:06,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1489
02:06:07,394 --> 02:06:08,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1490
02:06:46,517 --> 02:06:47,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. No.</font>

1491
02:07:12,918 --> 02:07:14,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take your friends, and run.</font>

1492
02:07:14,795 --> 02:07:16,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1493
02:07:16,714 --> 02:07:19,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run. They'll keep
coming and coming.</font>

1494
02:07:19,508 --> 02:07:22,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, you don't have
to fight anymore.</font>

1495
02:07:26,432 --> 02:07:28,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go.</font>

1496
02:07:36,066 --> 02:07:38,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be what they made you.</font>
