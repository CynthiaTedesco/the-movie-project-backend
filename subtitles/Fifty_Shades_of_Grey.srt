2
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:23,569
So,

3
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,133
how was he like?

4
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:27,903
Mr. Grey will see you now.

5
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,861
He was really very smart,

6
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:31,990
very intense.

7
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:33,617
To what do you owe your success?

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,761
I've always been good at people.

9
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:40,499
I have a natural instinct
for what makes a person tick.

10
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:42,417
Anastasia.

11
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,626
Christian.

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,714
You do realize
that he hasn't stopped looking at you?

13
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:54,346
Have you met someone?

14
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:58,030
Are you free?

15
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:00,435
I like to see your face.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,395
Gives me some clue
what you might be thinking.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,607
- So you're a control freak?
- I exercise control in all things.

18
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:08,011
It must be really boring.

19
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:21,855
You're not playing fair.

20
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,534
You should just steer clear of me.

21
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:28,990
I'm not the man for you.

22
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:32,107
Why won't you let me in?

23
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:35,593
I had a rough start in life.
That's all you need to know.

24
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,141
My tastes are very singular.

25
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,560
You wouldn't understand.

26
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,800
Enlighten me, then.

27
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:52,612
- Why are you trying to change me?
- I'm not.

28
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,681
It's you that's changing me.

29
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,721
I don't know if I can be with him
the way he needs me to.

30
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:16,928
Say I did stay, what would happen?
