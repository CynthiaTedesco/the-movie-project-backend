1
00:52:07,203 --> 00:52:09,021
Aragorn, something is out there!

2
00:52:15,912 --> 00:52:17,630
What do you see?

3
01:31:04,046 --> 01:31:08,746
Fast... quiet now.

4
01:31:11,258 --> 01:31:17,958
Fast... quiet now.

5
01:31:20,879 --> 01:31:25,617
Quiet... quiet... quiet.

6
01:31:27,669 --> 01:31:32,399
A battle is stirred up, they heard.

7
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:41,676
What is your name?

8
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:52,602
Your name is kingly.

9
01:31:53,421 --> 01:31:55,947
What troubles you, Brego?

10
01:32:01,406 --> 01:32:03,278
What did you see?

11
01:51:04,149 --> 01:51:05,824
You told me once...

12
01:51:08,004 --> 01:51:10,286
...this day would come.

13
01:51:11,252 --> 01:51:14,568
This is not the end...
it is the beginning.

14
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:16,432
You must go with Frodo.

15
01:51:16,978 --> 01:51:18,658
That is your path.

16
01:51:29,711 --> 01:51:32,176
My path is hidden from me.

17
01:51:32,923 --> 01:51:36,205
It is already laid before your feet.

18
01:51:36,876 --> 01:51:39,463
You cannot falter now.

19
01:51:42,534 --> 01:51:44,034
Arwen...

20
01:51:46,403 --> 01:51:48,690
If you trust nothing else...

21
01:51:49,261 --> 01:51:51,269
...trust this...

22
01:51:52,196 --> 01:51:54,359
Trust us.

23
01:53:24,563 --> 01:53:26,270
Is this how you leave?

24
01:53:27,778 --> 01:53:30,991
Did you think you could slip
away at first light unnoticed?

25
01:53:33,690 --> 01:53:35,885
I will not be coming back.

26
01:53:36,681 --> 01:53:38,731
You underestimate your skill in battle.

27
01:53:39,452 --> 01:53:40,599
You will come back.

28
01:53:40,601 --> 01:53:42,875
It is not of death in
battle that I speak.

29
01:53:42,877 --> 01:53:45,090
What do you speak of?

30
01:53:50,076 --> 01:53:53,599
You have a chance for another life...

31
01:53:55,801 --> 01:53:59,958
...away from war...grief, despair.

32
02:08:29,417 --> 02:08:30,388
It is time.

33
02:08:33,413 --> 02:08:37,235
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now...before it is too late.

34
02:11:12,355 --> 02:11:15,454
Do I not also have your love?

35
02:11:17,118 --> 02:11:19,018
You have my love, father.

36
02:12:10,237 --> 02:12:13,436
<i>The world is changed.</i>

37
02:12:14,013 --> 02:12:15,836
<i>I feel it in the water.</i>

38
02:12:16,491 --> 02:12:18,741
<i>I feel it in the earth,</i>

39
02:12:20,208 --> 02:12:24,231
<i>and I smell it in the air.</i>

40
02:31:21,125 --> 02:31:25,013
Well done, Brego, my friend.

41
02:32:01,130 --> 02:32:02,092
You're late.

42
02:32:34,581 --> 02:32:36,219
Thank you.

43
02:39:56,625 --> 02:39:57,891
And they should be...

44
02:39:58,918 --> 02:40:01,910
300...against 10,000!

45
02:40:03,750 --> 02:40:06,103
They have more hope of defending
themselves here than at Edoras...

46
02:40:06,105 --> 02:40:09,908
Aragorn, they cannot win this fight.

47
02:40:11,153 --> 02:40:12,435
They are all going to die!

48
02:44:48,380 --> 02:44:50,371
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.

49
02:46:14,163 --> 02:46:15,963
Well met, Haldir!

50
02:48:30,642 --> 02:48:34,169
Show them no mercy...

51
02:48:34,909 --> 02:48:37,459
...for you shall receive none!

52
02:49:57,283 --> 02:49:58,511
Hold!

53
02:50:28,601 --> 02:50:30,268
Prepare to fire!

54
02:50:30,537 --> 02:50:32,637
<i>Prepare to fire!</i>

55
02:50:38,194 --> 02:50:42,623
Their armour is weak at the
neck and beneath the arm.

56
02:50:42,625 --> 02:50:45,011
Fire the arrows!

57
02:51:01,509 --> 02:51:04,509
Keep firing!

58
02:51:32,624 --> 02:51:33,964
Ladders!

59
02:55:35,267 --> 02:55:37,448
Bring him down, Legolas!

60
02:55:39,956 --> 02:55:43,037
Kill him! Kill him!

61
02:57:18,716 --> 02:57:20,032
Hurl the arrows!

62
02:57:23,264 --> 02:57:24,916
Charge!

63
03:00:06,615 --> 03:00:08,048
To the Keep!

64
03:00:12,607 --> 03:00:14,165
Pull back!

65
03:00:15,192 --> 03:00:16,571
Haldir!

66
03:00:17,675 --> 03:00:19,074
Pull back!

67
03:00:24,860 --> 03:00:26,160
Pull back!

68
03:00:42,826 --> 03:00:44,975
Haldir!
