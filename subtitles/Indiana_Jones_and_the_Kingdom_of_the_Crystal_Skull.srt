00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:57,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's go! Let's go!</font>

2
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:01,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Hey, guys!</font>

3
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:20,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faster!</font>

4
00:01:22,138 --> 00:01:23,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what you got under there?</font>

5
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:25,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, you want to race?
- Oh, please.</font>

6
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:27,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on!
- Come on, let's go!</font>

7
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:36,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

8
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:42,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please?
- Come on! Let's go! Come on!</font>

9
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Let's go.</font>

10
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:05,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go faster! Faster!</font>

11
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:55,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, gentlemen.</font>

12
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:58,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This whole area is closed for
weapons testing for the next 24 hours.</font>

13
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:01,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That includes all on-base personnel.</font>

14
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:02,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good afternoon, sir.</font>

15
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:11,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid that goes for you,
too, Colonel, sir.</font>

16
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:13,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Pentagon sent out revised ...</font>

17
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Russians.</font>

18
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:42,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This ain't gonna be easy.</font>

19
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not as easy as it used to be.</font>

20
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:47,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, we've been through worse.
- Yeah? When?</font>

21
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:49,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flensburg. There was twice as many.</font>

22
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:51,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We were younger.
- I still am young!</font>

23
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:53,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had guns.</font>

24
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:57,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your hands down, will you?
You're embarrassing us.</font>

25
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:59,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bet you 500 bucks
we can get out of this.</font>

26
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:11,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's call it 100.</font>

27
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You recognize building, yes?</font>

28
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:25,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop dead.</font>

29
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

30
00:05:33,222 --> 00:05:35,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I meant drop dead, comrade.</font>

31
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:56,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where was he found?
- In Mexico.</font>

32
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were digging in the dirt,
looking for this stuff.</font>

33
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:07,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not from around here, are you?</font>

34
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:11,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is it you would imagine
I am from, Dr. Jones?</font>

35
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the way you're sinking your
teeth into those wubble-u's,</font>

36
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:18,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should think maybe Eastern Ukraine.</font>

37
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Highest marks.</font>

38
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:22,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko.</font>

39
00:06:24,565 --> 00:06:27,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three times
I have received Order of Lenin.</font>

40
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:32,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also medal as Hero of Socialist Labor.</font>

41
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:33,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And why?</font>

42
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:39,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I know things.
I know them before anyone else.</font>

43
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:43,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what I do not know, I find out.</font>

44
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, what I need to know now
is in here.</font>

45
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:08,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You are a hard man to read, Dr. Jones.
- Ouch.</font>

46
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:13,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we will do this, what is
expression, old-fashioned way.</font>

47
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:17,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will tell us.
You will help us find what we seek.</font>

48
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:41,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This warehouse is where you
and your government ...</font>

49
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:44,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have hidden all of your secrets, yes?</font>

50
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:48,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a military warehouse.
I've never been here before in my life.</font>

51
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Object we seek,
rectangular storage container,</font>

52
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:56,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">dimensions 2 meters by 0.5 meter
by 66 centimeters.</font>

53
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:59,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Contents of box, mummified remains.</font>

54
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:02,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is no doubt familiar to you.</font>

55
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What makes you think I've got any
idea what box you're talking about?</font>

56
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because 10 years ago ...</font>

57
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:11,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you were part of the team
that examined it.</font>

58
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look ...</font>

59
00:08:15,635 --> 00:08:19,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if I knew
what you were talking about ...</font>

60
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:22,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will help us find it.</font>

61
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:36,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Compass. I need a compass.</font>

62
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:38,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, north, south, east ...</font>

63
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:39,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">West.</font>

64
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:43,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No compass?</font>

65
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:46,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need your bullets.</font>

66
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The contents of that box
are highly magnetized.</font>

67
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need gunpowder.</font>

68
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:02,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want my help or not?</font>

69
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:19,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't toy with me, Dr. Jones.
What is the point of all this?</font>

70
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:21,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's still magnetic,</font>

71
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:24,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the metal in this gunpowder
should point the way.</font>

72
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:57,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shells. Give me some shotgun shells.</font>

73
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:02,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pliers.</font>

74
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:24,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop the guns,
or Colonel Dr. Spalko is dead.</font>

75
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:46,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why, Mac?</font>

76
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what can I say, Jonesey?</font>

77
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a capitalist, and they pay.</font>

78
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:57,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After all those years
we spent spying on the Reds?</font>

79
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought we were friends, Mac.</font>

80
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:05,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've had a run of bad luck
with the cards lately, mate.</font>

81
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:07,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awful. Bloody awful.</font>

82
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:12,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't go home empty-handed again.</font>

83
00:14:12,992 --> 00:14:16,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No defiant last words, Dr. Jones?</font>

84
00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:20,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like Ike.</font>

85
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put down gun.</font>

86
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:24,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it, pal.</font>

87
00:14:51,822 --> 00:14:54,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn, I thought that was closer.</font>

88
00:14:58,454 --> 00:14:59,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on.</font>

89
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not to get out of here alive!
Block the exits!</font>

90
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get clever, Boris.
You don't know him.</font>

91
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:29,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Know him. Know him.</font>

92
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:31,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know him!
You don't know him!</font>

93
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:34,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know him!
You don't know ...</font>

94
00:17:14,923 --> 00:17:16,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did well.</font>

95
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:58,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello? Hello?</font>

96
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:06,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello!</font>

97
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. I knocked.
You guys got a ...</font>

98
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.</font>

99
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:20,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, gang!</font>

100
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that can't be good.</font>

101
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:41,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All personnel,
it is now one minute to zero time.</font>

102
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:43,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put on goggles or turn away.</font>

103
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:49,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not remove goggles or face burst
until 10 seconds after first light.</font>

104
00:19:49,286 --> 00:19:50,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That can't be good at all.</font>

105
00:19:58,503 --> 00:20:02,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! Wait!
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!</font>

106
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:07,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure! Great! Don't wait for me!</font>

107
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:09,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Minus 15 seconds.</font>

108
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:19,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Minus 10 seconds.</font>

109
00:20:19,983 --> 00:20:26,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">9r, 8, 7, 6,</font>

110
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:30,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5r, 4,</font>

111
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3, 2, 1, 0.</font>

112
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:08,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had no reason to believe
that Mac was a spy.</font>

113
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:10,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was Ml6 when I was in OSS.</font>

114
00:22:10,844 --> 00:22:13,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We did 20, 30 missions together
in Europe and the Pacific.</font>

115
00:22:13,805 --> 00:22:16,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't wave your war record
in our face, Colonel Jones.</font>

116
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:18,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all served.</font>

117
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No kidding?
What side were you on?</font>

118
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:23,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think you recognize
the gravity of your situation.</font>

119
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:26,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You aided and abetted KGB agents ...</font>

120
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:29,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who broke into a top-secret
military installation ...</font>

121
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:32,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the middle of the
United States of America, my country.</font>

122
00:22:32,324 --> 00:22:35,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was in the steel box they took?</font>

123
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:38,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell us. You've seen it before.</font>

124
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:45,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean that Air Force fiasco in '47.</font>

125
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:49,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was tossed into a bus
with blacked-out windows ...</font>

126
00:22:49,674 --> 00:22:52,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and 20 people
I wasn't allowed to speak to.</font>

127
00:22:52,677 --> 00:22:54,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hauled out in the middle of the
night in the middle of nowhere ...</font>

128
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:57,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on some urgent recovery project
and shown what?</font>

129
00:22:57,474 --> 00:22:58,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pieces of wreckage ...</font>

130
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:03,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and an intensely magnetic shroud
covering mutilated remains?</font>

131
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:06,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of us
was ever given the full picture.</font>

132
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we were threatened with treason
if we ever talked about it.</font>

133
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:10,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you tell me,
what was in the box?</font>

134
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:12,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, thank God.</font>

135
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:14,740

I can vouch for Dr. Jones.</font>

a rapier, I think.</font>

she was Stalin's fair-haired girl.</font>

that you are of interest to the Bureau.</font>

207
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:54,084

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, old man!</font>

217
00:28:27,637 --> 00:28:31,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor, hello! Hey!
Are you Dr. Jones?</font>

218
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:33,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're running out of platform, kid.</font>

219
00:28:33,643 --> 00:28:35,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you a friend of Dr. Oxley's?</font>

220
00:28:35,937 --> 00:28:38,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Harold Oxley? The archeologist?
- Yeah.</font>

221
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:39,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about him?</font>

222
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:42,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're going to kill him.</font>

223
00:28:44,863 --> 00:28:47,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't talked to Harold Oxley
in 20 years.</font>

224
00:28:49,242 --> 00:28:51,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a brilliant guy.</font>

225
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:54,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He could put you to sleep
just by talking.</font>

226
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:57,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah. When I was a kid,
that's how I did get to sleep.</font>

227
00:28:57,709 --> 00:29:01,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oxley's voice was better than
a glass of warm milk, you know.</font>

228
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:03,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The name's Mutt, Mutt Williams.</font>

229
00:29:03,757 --> 00:29:06,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mutt? What kind of name is that?
- Yeah.</font>

230
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the one I picked.
You got a problem with it?</font>

231
00:29:09,137 --> 00:29:13,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it easy.
What was your relationship to Oxley?</font>

232
00:29:13,516 --> 00:29:18,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dad died in the war.
Ox kind of helped my mom raise me.</font>

233
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:21,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were saying
somebody's going to kill him?</font>

234
00:29:23,735 --> 00:29:27,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Six months ago,
my mom gets a letter from the Ox.</font>

235
00:29:27,155 --> 00:29:28,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's down in Peru.</font>

236
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:31,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Found some type of skull,
a crystal skull.</font>

237
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:35,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like the one that guy
Mitchell-Hodgkiss? Hedgkiss?</font>

238
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:37,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The one he found.
- Nice jacket.</font>

239
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:42,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Ox and I were obsessed with
the Mitchell-Hedges skull in college.</font>

240
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:44,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know about it?</font>

241
00:29:44,297 --> 00:29:45,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding?
It's all he talked about.</font>

242
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:47,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'd talk about that thing
till the cows come home.</font>

243
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's it? It's like an idol?</font>

244
00:29:49,552 --> 00:29:52,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deity carving. Mesoamerican.</font>

245
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are a number of crystal skulls
in the world.</font>

246
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:57,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw one in the British Museum.</font>

247
00:29:57,727 --> 00:30:01,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Interesting craftsmanship,
but that's about it.</font>

248
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:04,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, well, laugh if you want.
Oxley said he found it this time.</font>

249
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:08,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said this was real and he was off
to a place called Akator with it.</font>

250
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:11,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Akator? He said that? You're sure?
- Yeah.</font>

251
00:30:11,241 --> 00:30:14,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what he said.
He said Akator. What is it?</font>

252
00:30:14,994 --> 00:30:18,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a mythical lost city
in the Amazon.</font>

253
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:21,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Conquistadors called it El Dorado.</font>

254
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:25,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Supposedly, the Ugha tribe were
chosen by the gods 7,000 years ago ...</font>

255
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:29,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to build a giant city
out of solid gold.</font>

256
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:32,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It had aqueducts and paved roads ...</font>

257
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:37,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and technology that wouldn't
be seen again for 5,000 years.</font>

258
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Francisco de Orellana disappeared
into the Amazon looking for it in 1546.</font>

259
00:30:43,606 --> 00:30:46,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I almost died of typhus
looking for it myself.</font>

260
00:30:48,111 --> 00:30:49,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think it exists.</font>

261
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:52,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would Ox
want to take the skull there?</font>

262
00:30:52,532 --> 00:30:56,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The legend says that a crystal
skull was stolen from Akator ...</font>

263
00:30:56,452 --> 00:30:58,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the 15th or 16th century,</font>

264
00:30:58,454 --> 00:31:02,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that whoever returns
the skull to the city temple ...</font>

265
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will be given control over its power.</font>

266
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power. Right. So there's some
kind of power. What's the power?</font>

267
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:11,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, kid.
It's just a story.</font>

268
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:12,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

269
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:15,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From his letter, my mom thought
the Ox was off his rocker.</font>

270
00:31:15,805 --> 00:31:16,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, smog in the noggin,</font>

271
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:20,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so she goes down there to find him,
only he'd already been kidnapped.</font>

272
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now they've got her, too.</font>

273
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:23,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, Ox said
he hid that skull someplace,</font>

274
00:31:23,688 --> 00:31:26,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and if my mom doesn't come up with it,
they're gonna kill them both.</font>

275
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:29,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, she said you'd help me.</font>

276
00:31:29,903 --> 00:31:32,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me? What's your mom's name again?</font>

277
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:34,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mary. Mary Williams.
You remember her?</font>

278
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:36,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There were a lot of Marys, kid.</font>

279
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:38,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up! That's my mother
you're talking about!</font>

280
00:31:38,536 --> 00:31:40,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right? That's my mother.</font>

281
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:43,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to get sore all the
time just to prove how tough you are.</font>

282
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:45,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit down. Please. Sit down.</font>

283
00:31:47,003 --> 00:31:49,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said if anybody could find
the skull, it's you.</font>

284
00:31:50,048 --> 00:31:54,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like you're some type of ...
Like a grave robber or something.</font>

285
00:31:54,677 --> 00:31:57,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a tenured professor of archeology.</font>

286
00:31:57,597 --> 00:32:01,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you're a teacher.
Well, that's gonna be a big help.</font>

287
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:03,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, she called me
2 weeks ago from South America.</font>

288
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Said she'd escaped,
but they were after her.</font>

289
00:32:06,606 --> 00:32:08,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said she'd just gotten
a letter from the Ox ...</font>

290
00:32:08,358 --> 00:32:10,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and mailed it to me
so I could give it to you.</font>

291
00:32:10,443 --> 00:32:11,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then the line went dead.
I opened it.</font>

292
00:32:11,903 --> 00:32:14,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, the thing's pointless,
though. It's just gibberish.</font>

293
00:32:14,447 --> 00:32:16,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not even English lettering.</font>

294
00:32:16,908 --> 00:32:18,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See?</font>

295
00:32:19,911 --> 00:32:23,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See those two bricks over there,
at the counter?</font>

296
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:25,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
they're here for the milkshakes.</font>

297
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are they?</font>

298
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:31,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't know. Maybe FBI.</font>

299
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:33,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come quietly, Dr. Jones.</font>

300
00:32:33,132 --> 00:32:34,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make that KGB.</font>

301
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:37,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And bring letter with you.
- Letter? What letter?</font>

302
00:32:37,804 --> 00:32:39,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Letter Mr. Williams just give you.</font>

303
00:32:39,222 --> 00:32:41,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me? Do I look like a mailman?</font>

304
00:32:41,224 --> 00:32:42,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't ask again.
Come now or we'll ...</font>

305
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:44,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or what?</font>

306
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice try, kid, but I think
you just brought a knife ...</font>

307
00:32:48,898 --> 00:32:51,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to a gunfight.</font>

308
00:32:51,234 --> 00:32:52,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Outside now.</font>

309
00:32:57,323 --> 00:32:58,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hit this guy.
- Who?</font>

310
00:32:58,574 --> 00:33:00,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joe College. Hit him hard.</font>

311
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:02,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Here, hold this.
- What?</font>

312
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my boyfriend!</font>

313
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:09,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it outside!</font>

314
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get that greaser!</font>

315
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mom didn't escape.</font>

316
00:33:20,972 --> 00:33:23,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They let her go,
so she could mail the letter ...</font>

317
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you could bring it to me
and I could translate it!</font>

318
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:31,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on, gramps!</font>

319
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go, go, go!</font>

320
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:24,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!</font>

321
00:35:26,055 --> 00:35:29,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is crazy!
Somebody's going to get hurt!</font>

322
00:35:57,545 --> 00:35:59,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Left! Go left! Left!</font>

323
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:16,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move, move! Move!</font>

324
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:18,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Split, split! Split, split!</font>

325
00:36:18,274 --> 00:36:20,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're going too fast.
- That's a matter of opinion!</font>

326
00:36:33,831 --> 00:36:36,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me, Dr. Jones.
- Yes?</font>

327
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:40,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just had a question on
Hargrove's normative culture model.</font>

328
00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:41,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forget Hargrove.</font>

329
00:36:41,631 --> 00:36:44,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Read Vere Gordon Childe
on diffusionism.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">He spent most of his life
in the field.</font>

331
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want to be
a good archeologist,</font>

332
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:54,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you got to get out of the library!</font>

333
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is that?</font>

334
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:03,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Francisco de Orellana,
the conquistador.</font>

335
00:37:03,778 --> 00:37:06,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember, the guy who got lost
looking for the skull.</font>

336
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:09,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And just as I thought.</font>

337
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Koihoma.</font>

338
00:37:11,786 --> 00:37:13,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

339
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:18,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an extinct Latin American language.
Pre-Columbian syllabic base.</font>

340
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:23,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See. Diagonal stresses on the
ideograms. Definitely Koihoma.</font>

341
00:37:23,714 --> 00:37:25,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You speak it?
- Nobody speaks it.</font>

342
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:29,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It hasn't been heard aloud
in 3,000 years.</font>

343
00:37:29,095 --> 00:37:33,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I might be able to read a bit though
if I walk it through Mayan first.</font>

344
00:37:34,183 --> 00:37:36,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, for an old man,
you ain't bad in a fight.</font>

345
00:37:36,727 --> 00:37:38,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks a lot.</font>

346
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:40,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you, like, 80?</font>

347
00:37:43,901 --> 00:37:46,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a riddle.</font>

348
00:37:46,153 --> 00:37:49,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave it to Ox to write a riddle
in a dead language.</font>

349
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Follow the lines in the earth

- What are those?</font>

353
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:05,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on here.</font>

354
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:12,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Geoglyphs. Giant ancient drawings
carved into the desert floor in Peru.</font>

355
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:15,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From the ground,
they don't look like anything.</font>

356
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:19,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But from the sky,
only the gods can read them,</font>

357
00:38:19,103 --> 00:38:21,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because only gods live up there.</font>

358
00:38:23,899 --> 00:38:29,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oxley's telling us
the skull is in Nazca, Peru.</font>

359
00:39:30,966 --> 00:39:33,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finally. They saw him.</font>

360
00:39:33,177 --> 00:39:36,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ox wandered into town a couple of
months ago, raving like a madman.</font>

361
00:39:36,138 --> 00:39:38,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Police locked him up
in the sanitarium. It's this way.</font>

362
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:41,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took Spanish and I didn't understand
a word of that. What was it?</font>

363
00:39:41,143 --> 00:39:43,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quechua, local Incan dialect.</font>

364
00:39:43,437 --> 00:39:46,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where'd you learn that one?
- Long story.</font>

365
00:39:46,107 --> 00:39:47,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got time.</font>

366
00:39:47,775 --> 00:39:50,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I rode with Pancho Villa.
A couple of his guys spoke it.</font>

367
00:39:50,277 --> 00:39:51,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bullshit!</font>

368
00:39:52,029 --> 00:39:54,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You asked.
- Pancho Villa?</font>

369
00:39:54,365 --> 00:39:57,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Technically, I was kidnapped.
- By Pancho Villa?</font>

370
00:39:57,618 --> 00:40:01,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was the fight
against Victoriano Huerta.</font>

371
00:40:01,163 --> 00:40:03,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How old were you?
- About your age.</font>

373
00:40:06,043 --> 00:40:08,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It worked out.
Things were a little tense at home.</font>

374
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:10,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, me and my mom
aren't on the best of terms, either.</font>

375
00:40:10,256 --> 00:40:13,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Treat her right, kid. You only get
one and sometimes not for that long.</font>

376
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:15,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not my fault. It's hers.</font>

377
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:16,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She just got P.O.'ed
because I quit school.</font>

378
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:18,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She thinks I'm some
kind of goof or something.</font>

379
00:40:18,472 --> 00:40:20,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You quit school?
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Tons of them.</font>

380
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:22,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fancy prep schools
that teach you how to debate</font>

381
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:24,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and chess and fencing.</font>

382
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm great with the blade.
I just think it's a waste of time.</font>

383
00:40:27,022 --> 00:40:29,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You never finished.
- No.</font>

384
00:40:29,191 --> 00:40:31,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a bunch of useless skills.
Wrong books.</font>

385
00:40:31,902 --> 00:40:34,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I love reading.
Me and Ox used to read all the time.</font>

You get me?</font>

387
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:39,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you do for money?

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I will, Teach.
You got a problem with that?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">She says Ox isn't here.
She doesn't know where he is.</font>

394
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some men came and took him away,
men with guns.</font>

395
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:27,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She says he was obsessed, deranged.</font>

396
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:30,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drew pictures
all over the walls of his cell.</font>

397
00:41:34,757 --> 00:41:38,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This riddle in Oxley's letter
doesn't make any sense.</font>

398
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:43,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Follow the lines that only the gods
can read that lead to Orellana's cradle."</font>

399
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:46,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cradle, cradle, birth.</font>

400
00:41:46,393 --> 00:41:49,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Orellana wasn't born in Peru.
He was born in Spain.</font>

401
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a conquistador.
He came here for the gold.</font>

402
00:41:51,482 --> 00:41:52,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to him?</font>

403
00:41:52,983 --> 00:41:57,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He disappeared along with 6 others.
Their bodies were never found.</font>

404
00:42:26,475 --> 00:42:28,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must have lost his mind.</font>

405
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:38,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ox, man, what happened?
What happened?</font>

406
00:42:46,412 --> 00:42:49,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not the Mitchell-Hedges skull.</font>

407
00:42:49,623 --> 00:42:51,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the elongated cranium.</font>

408
00:42:52,751 --> 00:42:54,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the same word ...</font>

409
00:42:54,878 --> 00:42:57,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in different languages,
over and over again.</font>

410
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:03,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Return.</font>

411
00:43:03,345 --> 00:43:05,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Return where?</font>

412
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or return what?</font>

413
00:43:07,308 --> 00:43:09,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean the skull?</font>

414
00:43:09,893 --> 00:43:12,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seems to have been on his mind.</font>

415
00:43:12,521 --> 00:43:15,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where was he supposed to return it to?</font>

416
00:43:27,536 --> 00:43:29,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sweep.
- Yeah.</font>

417
00:43:38,756 --> 00:43:41,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ox didn't mean Orellana's birthplace.</font>

418
00:43:41,508 --> 00:43:43,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cradle has another meaning in Mayan.</font>

419
00:43:44,011 --> 00:43:48,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Literally, it means "resting place,"
as in final resting place.</font>

420
00:43:49,058 --> 00:43:51,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ox meant Orellana's grave.</font>

421
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This drawing scratched into the floor
is the cemetery where he's buried.</font>

422
00:43:57,066 --> 00:43:59,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said Orellana vanished
and nobody ever found his grave.</font>

423
00:43:59,735 --> 00:44:03,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it looks like Harold Oxley did.</font>

424
00:44:34,436 --> 00:44:36,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Grave robbers will be shot."</font>

425
00:44:36,605 --> 00:44:38,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good thing we're not grave robbers.</font>

426
00:44:46,532 --> 00:44:49,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are we looking for?
- I don't know yet.</font>

427
00:44:50,244 --> 00:44:53,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe an antechamber
off one of these barrows.</font>

428
00:45:09,471 --> 00:45:11,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I just saw something!</font>

429
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you're jumping at shadows.</font>

430
00:45:18,105 --> 00:45:20,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way down.</font>

431
00:45:28,907 --> 00:45:31,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This way up.
- Yeah.</font>

432
00:45:55,809 --> 00:45:57,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those darts are poison!</font>

433
00:45:59,396 --> 00:46:00,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay there.</font>

434
00:46:25,297 --> 00:46:27,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a teacher?</font>

435
00:46:29,134 --> 00:46:30,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Part-time.</font>

436
00:46:40,479 --> 00:46:41,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dead end.</font>

437
00:46:43,899 --> 00:46:45,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>

438
00:46:51,782 --> 00:46:53,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?
Put that thing away.</font>

439
00:46:53,116 --> 00:46:55,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me some light over here.</font>

440
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring it over here.</font>

441
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:12,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a thing.</font>

442
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:13,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dance on your own dime, will you?</font>

443
00:48:13,697 --> 00:48:15,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the scorpions just stung me!
Am I gonna die?</font>

444
00:48:15,824 --> 00:48:17,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How big?
- Huge!</font>

445
00:48:18,035 --> 00:48:19,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good.
- Good?</font>

446
00:48:21,038 --> 00:48:23,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When it comes to scorpions,
the bigger the better.</font>

447
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:27,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A small one bites you,
don't keep it to yourself.</font>

448
00:48:48,273 --> 00:48:52,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their skulls.
Look at their skulls, man.</font>

449
00:48:52,486 --> 00:48:56,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like the drawings in Oxley's cell.
Means we're getting closer.</font>

450
00:48:56,198 --> 00:48:58,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's crazy. Why is it like that?</font>

451
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nazca Indians used to
bind their infants' heads with rope</font>

452
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to elongate the skull like that.</font>

453
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why?
- Honor the gods.</font>

454
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:09,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.
God's head is not like that, man.</font>

455
00:49:09,628 --> 00:49:11,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Depends on who your god is.</font>

456
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:23,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going nowhere fast.</font>

457
00:49:28,855 --> 00:49:31,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor, this really
is a dead end. Look.</font>

458
00:49:38,532 --> 00:49:39,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

459
00:49:56,842 --> 00:49:59,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, genius.
Bring the backpack.</font>

460
00:50:17,529 --> 00:50:20,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is incredible.
- Unreal.</font>

461
00:50:23,118 --> 00:50:25,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't touch anything.</font>

462
00:50:28,206 --> 00:50:30,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Footprints. Somebody's been here.</font>

463
00:50:32,169 --> 00:50:33,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Recently.</font>

464
00:50:36,673 --> 00:50:38,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two sets of prints.</font>

465
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same size, could have been
the same person twice.</font>

466
00:50:43,638 --> 00:50:45,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not bad, kid.</font>

467
00:50:53,148 --> 00:50:56,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1. 2.</font>

468
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:00,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3. 4. 5. 6.</font>

469
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:03,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7.</font>

470
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:08,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Orellana and his men might've
made it out of the jungle after all.</font>

471
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me some light.</font>

472
00:51:18,507 --> 00:51:20,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have a knife, do you?</font>

473
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:45,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like he just died yesterday.</font>

474
00:51:46,076 --> 00:51:48,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the wrappings.
They preserved him.</font>

475
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What just happened?</font>

476
00:51:58,547 --> 00:52:02,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's been wrapped up for 500 years.
Air doesn't agree with him.</font>

477
00:52:10,183 --> 00:52:11,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

478
00:52:15,897 --> 00:52:17,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to keep
borrowing yours all the time.</font>

479
00:52:17,858 --> 00:52:20,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's fine.
- I was going to put it back.</font>

480
00:52:26,575 --> 00:52:28,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this one open already?</font>

481
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:50,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's him.</font>

482
00:52:50,348 --> 00:52:52,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Orellana himself.</font>

483
00:52:57,564 --> 00:53:01,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They called him The Gilded Man.
His lust for gold was legendary.</font>

484
00:53:03,612 --> 00:53:04,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's odd.</font>

485
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:10,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody's been here and gone.</font>

486
00:53:10,243 --> 00:53:16,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they left all this gold
and all the artifacts.</font>

487
00:53:18,335 --> 00:53:20,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were they looking for?</font>

488
00:53:33,642 --> 00:53:35,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hold this.
- No. No.</font>

489
00:53:54,871 --> 00:53:57,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unbelievable.</font>

490
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No tool marks.</font>

491
00:54:08,718 --> 00:54:11,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A single piece of seamless quartz.</font>

492
00:54:13,139 --> 00:54:15,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut across the grain.</font>

493
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:19,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not possible, even with
today's technology, it would shatter.</font>

494
00:54:26,486 --> 00:54:28,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crystal's not magnetic.</font>

495
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:30,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither is gold.</font>

496
00:54:34,077 --> 00:54:36,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this thing?</font>

497
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:40,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe the Nazca Indians thought
this was their god.</font>

498
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:43,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You think this is the one from ...
- From Akator.</font>

499
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:53,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe the Spaniards found this skull
along with all this other loot.</font>

500
00:54:53,221 --> 00:54:56,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were headed for their ships
along the shore.</font>

501
00:54:58,059 --> 00:55:01,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe the Indians
caught up with them,</font>

502
00:55:01,104 --> 00:55:03,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or they got to squabbling
amongst themselves ...</font>

503
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:07,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over their prize,
kill each other off.</font>

504
00:55:07,277 --> 00:55:10,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Indians wrap them up
and bury them.</font>

505
00:55:10,613 --> 00:55:15,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A couple of hundred years later,
Oxley shows up here, finds the skull.</font>

506
00:55:15,785 --> 00:55:19,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Takes it away, maybe to Akator.</font>

507
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:24,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then he returns it here.</font>

508
00:55:24,669 --> 00:55:26,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Return.</font>

509
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:29,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Return, like he wrote
on the walls of his cell.</font>

510
00:55:30,425 --> 00:55:34,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He put it back
where he found it. Why?</font>

511
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:02,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello, Jonesey.
- Hello, Mac.</font>

512
00:56:35,031 --> 00:56:36,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're lucky I turned up, Jonesey.</font>

513
00:56:36,991 --> 00:56:39,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dovchenko there wanted
to blow your brains out.</font>

514
00:56:39,327 --> 00:56:42,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the third time
I've saved your life.</font>

515
00:56:42,956 --> 00:56:45,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unshackle me.
I'll give you a big hug.</font>

516
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:48,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had a Luger
pointed at the base of your skull</font>

517
00:56:48,169 --> 00:56:49,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the first time we met.</font>

518
00:56:50,004 --> 00:56:51,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had the situation under control.</font>

519
00:56:51,965 --> 00:56:54,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You owe me.
- What do you owe them?</font>

520
00:56:56,803 --> 00:56:58,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After the war, when you turned,</font>

521
00:56:58,096 --> 00:56:59,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how many names
did you give the Reds?</font>

522
00:56:59,347 --> 00:57:00,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not looking
at the big picture here.</font>

523
00:57:00,807 --> 00:57:02,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many good men died
because of you?</font>

524
00:57:02,892 --> 00:57:05,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eventually, they're gonna
let me out of this chair, comrade,</font>

525
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:08,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and when they do,
I'm going to break your nose.</font>

526
00:57:08,731 --> 00:57:12,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Comrade"?
You think this is about flags?</font>

527
00:57:12,152 --> 00:57:14,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About uniforms? You think
this is about lines on a map?</font>

528
00:57:14,612 --> 00:57:16,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just about money, isn't it?</font>

529
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:18,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Not only money.</font>

530
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:23,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A gigantic pile of money.</font>

531
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:26,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry about
what the Russians will pay.</font>

532
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:30,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's nothing compared
to what's at Akator.</font>

533
00:57:31,254 --> 00:57:35,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An entire city of gold. It's what
the conquistadors were after.</font>

534
00:57:36,885 --> 00:57:41,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For God's sake, Jonesey, we'd be rich!
Richer than Howard Hughes!</font>

535
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:44,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blood money, every nickel.</font>

536
00:57:44,225 --> 00:57:46,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to see
the angle here, mate.</font>

537
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:49,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be smart. Do the right thing.
Just like in ...</font>

538
00:57:51,232 --> 00:57:53,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like in Berlin. Got me?</font>

539
00:57:53,902 --> 00:57:55,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like in Berlin.</font>

540
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:59,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me to trot off,
or should we sing a song?</font>

541
00:58:00,492 --> 00:58:04,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How fortunate our failure
to kill you, Dr. Jones.</font>

542
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:07,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You survive
to be of service to us once again.</font>

543
00:58:07,457 --> 00:58:10,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you know me,
always glad to help.</font>

544
00:58:10,502 --> 00:58:15,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Now I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."</font>

545
00:58:15,924 --> 00:58:18,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You recognize those words?</font>

546
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was your own Dr. Oppenheimer
after he created the atomic bomb.</font>

547
00:58:23,264 --> 00:58:24,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was quoting the Hindu bible.</font>

548
00:58:24,766 --> 00:58:26,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was nuclear intimidation.</font>

549
00:58:26,935 --> 00:58:30,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now this next level of weapon
is ours to have,</font>

550
00:58:31,022 --> 00:58:32,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">yours to fear.</font>

551
00:58:33,024 --> 00:58:35,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weapon? What weapon?</font>

552
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:37,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A mind weapon.</font>

553
00:58:37,445 --> 00:58:41,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A new frontier of psychic warfare.
That was Stalin's dream.</font>

554
00:58:43,952 --> 00:58:47,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I know why Oxley put the
skull back where he found it.</font>

555
00:58:48,081 --> 00:58:49,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knew you were looking for it.</font>

556
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:51,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That skull is no mere deity carving.</font>

557
00:58:51,501 --> 00:58:53,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surely you knew that
the moment you laid eyes on it.</font>

558
00:58:53,628 --> 00:58:56,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was not made by human hands.</font>

559
00:58:56,756 --> 00:58:58,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who made it, then?</font>

560
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:03,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

561
00:59:04,681 --> 00:59:07,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The body we found in New Mexico
was not the first.</font>

562
00:59:07,642 --> 00:59:11,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'd already dissected two others
from similar crash sites in Soviet Union.</font>

563
00:59:11,604 --> 00:59:13,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Saucer men from Mars.</font>

564
00:59:13,439 --> 00:59:15,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The legends about Akator
are all true.</font>

565
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Early men could not have
conceived it, much less built it.</font>

566
00:59:18,152 --> 00:59:20,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a city of supreme beings ...</font>

567
00:59:20,405 --> 00:59:23,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with technologies
and paranormal abilities.</font>

568
00:59:23,575 --> 00:59:25,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got to be kidding me.</font>

569
00:59:26,035 --> 00:59:29,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you choose
not to believe your own eyes?</font>

570
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:34,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The New Mexico specimen
gave us hope.</font>

571
00:59:35,003 --> 00:59:39,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unlike the others we'd found,
its skeleton was pure crystal.</font>

572
00:59:41,676 --> 00:59:45,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A distant cousin, perhaps. Maybe they,
too, were sent to find Akator.</font>

573
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:49,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps we're all searching
for the same thing.</font>

574
00:59:51,477 --> 00:59:56,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There is no other explanation.
- There's always another explanation.</font>

575
00:59:56,149 --> 01:00:00,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The skull was stolen from Akator
in the 15th century.</font>

576
01:00:00,486 --> 01:00:01,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoever returns it ...</font>

577
01:00:01,696 --> 01:00:04,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Returns it to the city temple
will gain control over its powers.</font>

578
01:00:04,198 --> 01:00:07,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've heard that bedtime story before.</font>

579
01:00:07,243 --> 01:00:10,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a legend.
Why do you think Akator even existed?</font>

580
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:12,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should ask your friend
that question.</font>

581
01:00:12,874 --> 01:00:15,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're certain he's been there.</font>

582
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:17,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oxley?</font>

583
01:00:32,143 --> 01:00:34,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ox, it's me, Indy.</font>

584
01:00:35,313 --> 01:00:36,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ox?</font>

585
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:40,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ox, you're faking it, right?</font>

586
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:43,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Through eyes
that last I saw in tears ..."</font>

587
01:00:43,863 --> 01:00:47,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ox, listen to me, pal.
Your name is Harold Oxley.</font>

588
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:49,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were born in Leeds, England.</font>

589
01:00:49,494 --> 01:00:52,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and I went to school together
at the University of Chicago.</font>

590
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:55,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you were never this interesting.
My name is ...</font>

591
01:00:57,085 --> 01:00:59,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Henry Jones, Jr.</font>

592
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you done to him?</font>

593
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We ain't done a thing.
It's the bloody skull.</font>

594
01:01:04,676 --> 01:01:07,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is the divining rod
that will lead us to Akator.</font>

595
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:10,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we need someone
to interpret him for us.</font>

596
01:01:10,473 --> 01:01:15,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His mind, it seems, is quite weak.
Let's hope yours is stronger.</font>

597
01:01:17,939 --> 01:01:22,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The skull's crystal stimulates an
undeveloped part of the human brain,</font>

598
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">opening a psychic channel.</font>

599
01:01:24,612 --> 01:01:28,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oxley lost control of his mind
by staring too long into its eyes.</font>

600
01:01:28,783 --> 01:01:33,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We believe you can get through to
him after you have done the same.</font>

601
01:01:33,454 --> 01:01:36,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a better idea.
You look at it.</font>

602
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:39,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The skull does not speak
to everyone, it seems.</font>

603
01:01:40,795 --> 01:01:43,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surely you're not afraid,
Dr. Jones.</font>

604
01:01:43,464 --> 01:01:46,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've spent your entire life
searching for answers.</font>

605
01:01:46,134 --> 01:01:49,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think of the truth behind those eyes.</font>

606
01:01:49,303 --> 01:01:51,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There may be
hundreds of skulls at Akator.</font>

607
01:01:51,973 --> 01:01:54,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoever finds them will control
the greatest natural force ...</font>

608
01:01:54,642 --> 01:01:56,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the world has ever known.</font>

609
01:01:59,147 --> 01:02:01,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power over the mind of man.</font>

610
01:02:01,774 --> 01:02:05,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be careful, you might get
exactly what you wish for.</font>

611
01:02:05,486 --> 01:02:06,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I usually do.</font>

612
01:02:40,188 --> 01:02:42,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine.</font>

613
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:46,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To peer across the world
and know the enemy's secrets.</font>

614
01:02:46,444 --> 01:02:49,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To place our thoughts
into the minds of your leaders.</font>

615
01:02:49,781 --> 01:02:52,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make your teachers
teach the true version of history,</font>

616
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:55,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your soldiers attack on our command.</font>

617
01:02:55,369 --> 01:02:58,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll be everywhere at once,
more powerful than a whisper,</font>

618
01:02:58,247 --> 01:02:59,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">invading your dreams,</font>

619
01:02:59,707 --> 01:03:02,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thinking your thoughts for you
while you sleep.</font>

620
01:03:04,754 --> 01:03:07,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will change you, Dr. Jones,</font>

621
01:03:07,715 --> 01:03:10,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all of you, from the inside.</font>

622
01:03:10,593 --> 01:03:13,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will turn you into us.</font>

623
01:03:13,387 --> 01:03:18,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the best part?
You won't even know it's happening.</font>

624
01:03:20,561 --> 01:03:21,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Return.</font>

625
01:03:24,732 --> 01:03:26,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Return?</font>

626
01:03:29,445 --> 01:03:30,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's enough.</font>

627
01:03:33,741 --> 01:03:36,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's enough.
If he dies, we can't get there.</font>

628
01:03:38,037 --> 01:03:39,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover it.</font>

629
01:03:44,544 --> 01:03:45,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry.</font>

630
01:03:46,629 --> 01:03:48,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right, Jonesey?</font>

631
01:03:54,428 --> 01:03:55,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You broke my nose!
- I told you.</font>

632
01:03:55,930 --> 01:04:00,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough! You will speak to Oxley
and lead us to Akator, yes?</font>

633
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take him outside.</font>

634
01:04:10,152 --> 01:04:12,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You all right, kid?
- They left my bike at the cemetery.</font>

635
01:04:12,864 --> 01:04:14,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, but you're all right?
- They left my bike.</font>

636
01:04:14,782 --> 01:04:18,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.</font>

637
01:04:26,502 --> 01:04:30,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm ready.
Don't give these pigs a thing.</font>

638
01:04:30,464 --> 01:04:32,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You heard him.</font>

639
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:35,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clearly I have chosen
the wrong pressure point.</font>

640
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps I can find
a more sensitive one.</font>

641
01:04:39,974 --> 01:04:44,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your hands off me,
you rotten Russki son of a bitch!</font>

642
01:04:47,481 --> 01:04:49,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana Jones.</font>

643
01:04:53,237 --> 01:04:54,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About time you showed up.</font>

644
01:04:54,697 --> 01:04:56,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom!
- Sweetheart.</font>

645
01:04:56,657 --> 01:04:58,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Mom"?</font>

646
01:04:58,409 --> 01:04:59,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

647
01:04:59,827 --> 01:05:01,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forget about me. Are you all right?</font>

648
01:05:01,996 --> 01:05:04,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "Mom"?
- Young man, I specifically told you ...</font>

649
01:05:04,332 --> 01:05:05,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not to come here.
- Marion is your mother?</font>

650
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never wrote that. You never
said that in any phone calls.</font>

651
01:05:08,127 --> 01:05:10,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion Ravenwood is your mother?</font>

652
01:05:10,379 --> 01:05:13,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For God's sake, Indy,
it's not that hard.</font>

653
01:05:13,674 --> 01:05:15,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I mean, I just never thought ...</font>

654
01:05:15,676 --> 01:05:17,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would have a life after you left.</font>

655
01:05:17,345 --> 01:05:19,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's not what I meant.
- A damn good life!</font>

656
01:05:19,931 --> 01:05:23,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, that's fine.
- A damn good, really good life!</font>

657
01:05:23,601 --> 01:05:25,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, so have I!
- Yeah?</font>

658
01:05:25,186 --> 01:05:26,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still leaving
a trail of human wreckage,</font>

659
01:05:27,063 --> 01:05:28,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or have you retired?</font>

660
01:05:28,564 --> 01:05:30,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why? You looking for a date?</font>

661
01:05:30,149 --> 01:05:32,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With anybody but you.</font>

662
01:05:32,485 --> 01:05:36,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Dr. Jones, you will help us?</font>

663
01:05:36,113 --> 01:05:37,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A simple "yes" will do.</font>

664
01:05:37,657 --> 01:05:40,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Marion, you had to go
and get yourself kidnapped.</font>

665
01:05:40,201 --> 01:05:42,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not like you did any better.</font>

666
01:05:43,955 --> 01:05:45,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same old, same old.</font>

667
01:05:47,959 --> 01:05:50,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry Jones, Jr.</font>

668
01:05:51,837 --> 01:05:55,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Henry Jones, Jr. ...
- That's right, Ox. Listen to me.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">"To lay their just hands

- Palace of ...</font>

671
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:03,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's from Milton.
He's said it before. Why?</font>

672
01:06:04,016 --> 01:06:06,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ox, you got to tell us
how to get to Akator ...</font>

673
01:06:06,602 --> 01:06:08,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or they're gonna kill Marion.</font>

We need ...</font>

677
01:06:26,122 --> 01:06:27,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me paper.
Something to write with.</font>

678
01:06:39,093 --> 01:06:41,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Autowriting!
I should have seen this.</font>

679
01:06:45,766 --> 01:06:50,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Henry Jones, Jr.
- Right. That's right, Ox.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ideograms.</font>

683
01:07:09,749 --> 01:07:11,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good, Ox. Good.</font>

684
01:07:23,554 --> 01:07:25,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ox?</font>

685
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me, Ox.</font>

686
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:33,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Mutt, Ox. Hey, look at me.
Look at me. It's me.</font>

687
01:07:35,566 --> 01:07:36,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me.</font>

688
01:07:40,279 --> 01:07:44,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The wavy lines mean water, of course.
Closed eyes mean sleep.</font>

689
01:07:44,283 --> 01:07:48,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sun with the arc over the sky
stands for time, duration.</font>

690
01:07:48,662 --> 01:07:51,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The word "now" is "until."</font>

691
01:07:51,332 --> 01:07:52,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These two close together,</font>

692
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:56,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the horizon and the snake,
mean one thought.</font>

693
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:58,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The horizon stood for the world,</font>

694
01:07:58,255 --> 01:08:01,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it didn't mean the Earth.
It meant big, great.</font>

695
01:08:03,844 --> 01:08:07,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The water sleeps
until the great snake."</font>

696
01:08:07,681 --> 01:08:10,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These aren't just drawings,
they're directions. Get me a map!</font>

697
01:08:15,106 --> 01:08:17,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The great snake is the Amazon,
of course,</font>

698
01:08:17,149 --> 01:08:20,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but "sleep," what water sleeps?</font>

699
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:27,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here! Sono.
The Portuguese word for "sleep."</font>

700
01:08:27,743 --> 01:08:29,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, good. Exactly.</font>

701
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:35,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wants us
to follow this curve of the Sono ...</font>

702
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">down to where it meets the Amazon
to the southeast.</font>

703
01:08:39,338 --> 01:08:41,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After that, I'm not sure.</font>

704
01:08:41,215 --> 01:08:45,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kingdom of dreams, tears and eyes ...
I have no idea what he means.</font>

705
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:46,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This could be the route, though.</font>

706
01:08:46,804 --> 01:08:49,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a completely unexplored part
of the canopy.</font>

707
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:55,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go, go, go! Come on!</font>

708
01:09:02,236 --> 01:09:04,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Kid, what the hell are we doing, kid?
- They were going to kill us!</font>

709
01:09:04,488 --> 01:09:06,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, maybe.
- Somebody had to do something!</font>

710
01:09:06,824 --> 01:09:09,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Something else would have been good.
- At least I got a plan.</font>

711
01:09:09,201 --> 01:09:12,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is intolerable.
Harold, for God's sake, keep up.</font>

712
01:09:20,754 --> 01:09:21,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom?</font>

713
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:24,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stay back!
- Stop! Stop! Stop! Don't move.</font>

714

space will make you sink.</font>

715

<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I think I can get out
if I can just ...</font>

716
01:09:27,761 --> 01:09:29,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it!
You're pulling against a vacuum.</font>

717
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:31,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like trying to lift a car.
Just stay calm.</font>

718
01:09:31,348 --> 01:09:32,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'm calm.</font>

719
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is it? Quicksand?
- I'm calm.</font>

720
01:09:33,976 --> 01:09:35,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, it's a dry sand pit.
- I'm sinking, but I'm calm.</font>

721
01:09:36,061 --> 01:09:38,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quicksand is a mix of sand,
mud and water.</font>

722
01:09:38,147 --> 01:09:40,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And depending on the viscosity,
it's not as dangerous ...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- as people sometimes think.
- For Pete's sake, Jones,</font>

to worry about unless there's a ...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">A void collapse.</font>

727
01:09:51,118 --> 01:09:53,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll go get something
to pull you out.</font>

728
01:09:53,495 --> 01:09:55,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ox, don't just sit there.</font>

729
01:09:55,456 --> 01:09:58,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For God's sake, man, go get help!</font>

730
01:09:59,043 --> 01:10:01,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Help?
- Help!</font>

731
01:10:01,212 --> 01:10:02,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help?</font>

732
01:10:02,796 --> 01:10:04,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help! Go!</font>

733
01:10:07,259 --> 01:10:09,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mutt can be a little impetuous.</font>

734
01:10:09,678 --> 01:10:11,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not the worst quality
in the world.</font>

735
01:10:12,806 --> 01:10:15,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your arms above the surface.
When the kid comes back, grab on.</font>

01:10:15,809 --> 01:10:18,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Indy, he ...
- He's a good kid, Marion.</font>

737
01:10:18,979 --> 01:10:20,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should get off his back
about school.</font>

738

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mutt, I mean ...

<font face="Comic Sans MS">My son?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry Jones the Third.</font>

744
01:10:36,538 --> 01:10:40,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why the hell didn't you
make him finish school?</font>

745
01:10:40,501 --> 01:10:43,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom, grab on! Grab it!
- Yeah.</font>

746
01:10:43,254 --> 01:10:44,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it.</font>

747
01:10:45,798 --> 01:10:48,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Mom!
Pull, pull, pull, pull!</font>

748
01:10:49,051 --> 01:10:50,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull!</font>

749
01:10:53,264 --> 01:10:54,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab on.</font>

750
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:59,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Grab it.
- Just grab it, Indy.</font>

751
01:10:59,186 --> 01:11:00,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a rat snake!</font>

752
01:11:00,813 --> 01:11:02,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Rat snakes aren't that big.
- Well, this one is, all right?</font>

753
01:11:02,856 --> 01:11:04,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not even poisonous.
Now grab on!</font>

754
01:11:04,525 --> 01:11:07,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go get something else.
- Like what?</font>

755
01:11:07,152 --> 01:11:08,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a rope or something.</font>

756
01:11:08,988 --> 01:11:12,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no Sears and Roebuck here!
Grab the snake!</font>

757
01:11:14,576 --> 01:11:17,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Maybe I can touch the bottom.
- There's no bottom. Now grab it.</font>

758
01:11:17,871 --> 01:11:19,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I think
I can feel it with my feet.</font>

759
01:11:19,873 --> 01:11:22,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Grab the snake!
- Stop calling it that!</font>

760
01:11:22,584 --> 01:11:24,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a snake!
What do you want me to call it?</font>

761
01:11:24,378 --> 01:11:26,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Say "rope."
- What?</font>

762
01:11:26,338 --> 01:11:28,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say "grab the rope."</font>

763
01:11:28,507 --> 01:11:31,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Grab the rope!
- Grab the rope!</font>

764
01:11:31,135 --> 01:11:33,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold tight. It's slimy.</font>

765
01:11:33,929 --> 01:11:35,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull!</font>

766

767
01:11:45,733 --> 01:11:47,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Afraid of snakes.</font>

768
01:11:48,944 --> 01:11:50,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are one crazy old man.</font>

769
01:11:54,783 --> 01:11:58,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you have to do everything
the hard way, Jonesey?</font>

770
01:12:02,082 --> 01:12:04,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good work, Ox. Thanks.</font>

771
01:12:04,835 --> 01:12:05,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help.</font>

772
01:12:39,828 --> 01:12:44,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, he was British.
My dad was an RAF pilot.</font>

773
01:12:44,124 --> 01:12:46,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a war hero,
not some schoolteacher!</font>

774
01:12:46,502 --> 01:12:50,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, sweetheart.
Colin was your stepfather.</font>

775
01:12:50,297 --> 01:12:52,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We started dating
when you were 3 months old.</font>

776
01:12:52,174 --> 01:12:53,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a good man.</font>

777
01:12:53,634 --> 01:12:57,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait, wait. Colin?
As in Colin Williams? You ...</font>

778
01:12:59,014 --> 01:13:01,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You married him? I introduced you!</font>

779
01:13:01,642 --> 01:13:04,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you gave up your vote
on who I married ...</font>

780
01:13:04,812 --> 01:13:07,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you decided to break it off
a week before the wedding!</font>

781
01:13:07,815 --> 01:13:10,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we both knew, Marion,
it wasn't going to work.</font>

782
01:13:10,234 --> 01:13:12,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't know that. Why didn't
you ever talk to me about it?</font>

783
01:13:12,778 --> 01:13:14,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we never had an argument
I won!</font>

784
01:13:14,738 --> 01:13:16,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not my fault
if you can't keep up!</font>

785
01:13:16,573 --> 01:13:17,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't want to hurt you!</font>

786
01:13:17,825 --> 01:13:20,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For love of God, shut the hell up!</font>

787
01:13:20,536 --> 01:13:24,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't you ever wonder years ago
why Ox stopped talking to you?</font>

788
01:13:24,623 --> 01:13:26,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He hated that you ran away.</font>

789
01:13:26,417 --> 01:13:27,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you two just stop?</font>

790
01:13:27,918 --> 01:13:31,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Marion, let's not let
the kid see mom and dad fight.</font>

791
01:13:31,588 --> 01:13:33,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're not my dad, okay?
- You bet I am.</font>

792
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:35,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I got news for you.</font>

793
01:13:35,259 --> 01:13:37,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna go back
and finish school.</font>

794
01:13:37,344 --> 01:13:38,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? What happened to,</font>

795
01:13:38,595 --> 01:13:40,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"There's not a damn thing
wrong with it, kid,</font>

796
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and don't let anybody else
tell you any different"?</font>

797
01:13:41,557 --> 01:13:42,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't remember saying that?</font>

798
01:13:42,891 --> 01:13:44,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was before I was your father!</font>

799
01:13:44,685 --> 01:13:46,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're not my father!
- Oh, yes, he is your father.</font>

800
01:13:46,228 --> 01:13:47,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have
told me about the kid, Marion.</font>

801
01:13:47,813 --> 01:13:49,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a right to know.</font>

802
01:13:49,148 --> 01:13:50,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You vanished after that.</font>

803
01:13:50,899 --> 01:13:53,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I wrote.
- A year later!</font>

804
01:13:53,527 --> 01:13:57,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By then,
Mutt was born and I was married!</font>

805
01:13:57,406 --> 01:13:59,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you bothering
to tell me now?</font>

806
01:13:59,283 --> 01:14:01,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I thought we were gonna die!</font>

807
01:14:01,702 --> 01:14:02,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not yet!</font>

808
01:14:17,426 --> 01:14:18,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it?</font>

809
01:14:23,056 --> 01:14:24,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

810
01:14:36,737 --> 01:14:39,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure I wasn't the only one
to go on with my life.</font>

811
01:14:39,531 --> 01:14:42,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There must've been plenty of
women for you over the years.</font>

812
01:14:42,576 --> 01:14:46,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. There were a few,
but they all had the same problem.</font>

813
01:14:46,872 --> 01:14:48,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? What's that?</font>

814
01:14:50,834 --> 01:14:52,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They weren't you, honey.</font>

815
01:15:17,027 --> 01:15:19,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got to get Oxley back,
get our hands on that skull ...</font>

816
01:15:19,196 --> 01:15:22,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and get to Akator before they do.
Grab the wheel.</font>

817
01:15:34,127 --> 01:15:36,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's he gonna do now?</font>

818
01:15:36,338 --> 01:15:38,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't think he plans that far ahead.
- Yeah.</font>

819
01:15:39,591 --> 01:15:42,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Scooch over, will you, Son?
- Don't call me "son." Don't.</font>

820
01:15:43,053 --> 01:15:45,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'd cover my ears
if I were you.</font>

821
01:15:55,816 --> 01:15:57,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Duck! Duck!</font>

822
01:16:00,821 --> 01:16:02,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move, move!</font>

823
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull up next to that duck.</font>

824
01:16:15,794 --> 01:16:18,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry Jones, Jr.</font>

825

01:16:47,618 --> 01:16:49,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Come on!</font>

827
01:17:04,593 --> 01:17:05,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down!</font>

828
01:17:17,773 --> 01:17:20,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ox has got the skull.
Marion, take the wheel.</font>

829
01:17:20,817 --> 01:17:22,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not fair.
She drove the truck.</font>

830
01:17:22,235 --> 01:17:25,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be a child.
Find something to fight with.</font>

831
01:17:35,082 --> 01:17:36,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jonesey!</font>

832
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jonesey!
- Hi, Mac.</font>

833
01:18:27,008 --> 01:18:30,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Indy. Indy! Indy!
- Shut up! Shut up!</font>

834
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:35,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You stupid son of a bitch! I'm CIA.
- CIA.</font>

835
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:38,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I almost screamed it at you in the
tent. I said, "Just like Berlin."</font>

836
01:18:39,062 --> 01:18:41,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were we in Berlin, mate?</font>

837
01:18:41,106 --> 01:18:42,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Double agents!
- The skull!</font>

838
01:18:43,024 --> 01:18:48,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Throw me the skull!</font>

839
01:19:10,677 --> 01:19:11,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Riposte.</font>

840
01:19:17,309 --> 01:19:19,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on your front foot. Riposte.</font>

841
01:19:19,519 --> 01:19:21,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a match, Mom.</font>

842
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:51,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fight like a young man,
eager to begin, quick to finish.</font>

843
01:19:51,885 --> 01:19:53,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mutt, disengage!</font>

844
01:20:32,926 --> 01:20:35,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Hey, I got the skull!</font>

845
01:20:35,512 --> 01:20:37,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Throw the bag! Throw it!
- Throw the bag!</font>

846
01:20:38,306 --> 01:20:39,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Gun!
- Gun!</font>

847

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you looking at, Daddy-o?
She's getting away!</font>

848
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:30,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is very dangerous.</font>

849
01:22:58,071 --> 01:23:00,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do svidanya, Dr. Jones.</font>

850
01:23:28,268 --> 01:23:29,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones!</font>

851
01:23:32,355 --> 01:23:35,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

852
01:23:37,068 --> 01:23:38,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

853
01:23:43,283 --> 01:23:44,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn!</font>

854
01:24:16,441 --> 01:24:17,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Siafu.
- What?</font>

855
01:24:17,859 --> 01:24:19,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big damn ants! Go!</font>

856
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:35,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run to the river!</font>

857
01:24:55,188 --> 01:24:56,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to the river!</font>

858
01:25:05,949 --> 01:25:08,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jump in! Come on! Come on!</font>

859
01:25:13,832 --> 01:25:15,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, there's a cliff!</font>

860
01:28:00,748 --> 01:28:03,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jonesey, come on!
- Get in, Jones!</font>

861
01:28:19,851 --> 01:28:22,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom, stop.
- Mom, slow down.</font>

862
01:28:26,065 --> 01:28:27,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Honey, stop.
- Slow down, Mom.</font>

863
01:28:27,317 --> 01:28:28,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're gonna go off the cliff.
- That's the idea.</font>

864
01:28:29,068 --> 01:28:31,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bad idea. Give me the wheel.
- Trust me!</font>

865
01:28:31,738 --> 01:28:33,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow down!</font>

866
01:29:00,767 --> 01:29:04,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't ever do that again.
- Yes, dear.</font>

867
01:29:15,531 --> 01:29:17,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 times it drops.</font>

868
01:29:21,454 --> 01:29:24,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reverse. Put it in reverse!
Full reverse!</font>

869
01:29:24,123 --> 01:29:25,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm trying! I'm trying!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mom!</font>

870
01:29:47,188 --> 01:29:48,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The way down.</font>

871
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:53,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He means by land.
He came by land.</font>

872
01:29:56,322 --> 01:29:58,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Three times it drops?
- Three times it drops.</font>

873
01:29:58,658 --> 01:30:00,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is he talking about?</font>

874
01:30:00,118 --> 01:30:01,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He means 1!</font>

875

<font face="Comic Sans MS">2!</font>

876

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay? Babe? Let go.</font>

878
01:31:02,972 --> 01:31:05,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Through eyes that last I saw in tears."</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The golden vision reappears!"</font>

880
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:15,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gold. I'm in.</font>

881
01:31:15,985 --> 01:31:20,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Through eyes ... Through eyes in tears.
We got to go through that waterfall!</font>

882
01:31:22,658 --> 01:31:26,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The skull has to be returned.
I'll do it. Nobody else has to come.</font>

883
01:31:26,579 --> 01:31:28,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who cares?</font>

884
01:31:28,831 --> 01:31:31,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's brought us nothing but trouble.</font>

885
01:31:31,792 --> 01:31:34,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look what it did to him.</font>

886
01:31:34,337 --> 01:31:37,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I have to return it.
- Why you?</font>

887
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:39,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it told me to.</font>

888
01:31:52,438 --> 01:31:56,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ochre, iron oxide, charcoal.
- Oxy, stay with us.</font>

889
01:31:56,943 --> 01:31:58,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How old is this?</font>

890
01:31:58,653 --> 01:32:01,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 or 5,000 years.
Old as the pyramids.</font>

891
01:32:02,532 --> 01:32:05,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, sun worshippers,
like the Egyptians.</font>

892
01:32:08,621 --> 01:32:11,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is fresh.
These were just used.</font>

893
01:32:25,805 --> 01:32:27,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More worshippers.</font>

894
01:32:27,598 --> 01:32:30,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but that's not
the sun they're worshipping.</font>

895
01:32:36,983 --> 01:32:38,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone came ...</font>

896
01:32:41,612 --> 01:32:44,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and taught the Ugha farming.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I understand, Ox.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone came?</font>

901
01:33:49,597 --> 01:33:51,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are they the same?</font>

902
01:33:51,182 --> 01:33:53,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There were more. Look.</font>

903
01:33:56,937 --> 01:33:58,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thirteen in a circle.</font>

904
01:34:06,072 --> 01:34:07,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show us the way, Ox.</font>

01:36:53,072 --> 01:36:55,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Key that ope's the palace.</font>

923
01:36:56,909 --> 01:36:59,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The obelisk.
The obelisk is the key?</font>

924
01:37:07,086 --> 01:37:09,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you looking for, Ox?</font>

925
01:37:11,632 --> 01:37:13,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

926
01:37:18,264 --> 01:37:21,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You figured this out in your cell,
didn't you, Professor?</font>

927
01:37:22,893 --> 01:37:24,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, Professor.</font>

928
01:37:39,743 --> 01:37:41,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done.</font>

929
01:37:42,288 --> 01:37:43,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go get your own.</font>

930
01:38:43,182 --> 01:38:44,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen.</font>

931
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:47,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hear that?</font>

932
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:52,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up! Move! Ox, move!</font>

933
01:38:56,028 --> 01:39:01,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faster! Faster!</font>

934
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faster!</font>

935
01:39:02,868 --> 01:39:05,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not good. Move, Ox! Move!</font>

936
01:39:05,788 --> 01:39:07,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quick! Quick! Quick!</font>

937
01:39:10,042 --> 01:39:12,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like this!
I don't like it!</font>

938
01:39:12,753 --> 01:39:14,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom, come on!
- Jonesey!</font>

939
01:39:32,064 --> 01:39:34,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He dropped it.
He dropped the skull!</font>

940
01:39:34,483 --> 01:39:35,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

941
01:39:46,078 --> 01:39:47,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold this.</font>

942
01:39:50,874 --> 01:39:52,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ox, you okay?</font>

943
01:39:56,338 --> 01:39:57,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lovely.</font>

944
01:39:58,716 --> 01:40:00,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's go.</font>

945
01:40:07,599 --> 01:40:08,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way?</font>

946
01:41:16,001 --> 01:41:18,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that's more like it.</font>

947
01:41:24,051 --> 01:41:27,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are artifacts
from every era of early history.</font>

948
01:41:28,055 --> 01:41:30,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Macedonian.</font>

949
01:41:30,349 --> 01:41:32,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sumerian.
- This place is the mother lode.</font>

950
01:41:33,018 --> 01:41:34,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Etruscan. Babylonian.</font>

951
01:41:35,062 --> 01:41:39,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There isn't a museum in the world that
wouldn't sell its soul for this lot.</font>

952
01:41:39,274 --> 01:41:40,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Early Egyptian.</font>

953
01:41:40,442 --> 01:41:43,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dozens of museums.
Hundreds of them, Jonesey!</font>

954
01:41:44,279 --> 01:41:45,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Collectors.</font>

955
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were archeologists.</font>

956
01:42:27,781 --> 01:42:29,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do we open it?</font>

957
01:42:34,913 --> 01:42:38,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll give it back, Ox. I promise.</font>

958
01:43:57,496 --> 01:44:00,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more forever waiting.</font>

959
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soon now.</font>

960
01:44:12,928 --> 01:44:14,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Jonesey.</font>

961
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:17,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what are you, a triple agent?</font>

962
01:44:17,683 --> 01:44:21,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah, I just lied
about being a double.</font>

963
01:44:26,358 --> 01:44:28,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at them!</font>

964
01:44:30,195 --> 01:44:34,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still waiting for the return
of the one who was lost.</font>

965
01:44:39,204 --> 01:44:41,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are a hive mind.</font>

966
01:44:43,083 --> 01:44:47,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One being physically separate,
but with a collective consciousness.</font>

967
01:44:49,548 --> 01:44:52,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More powerful together
than they can ever be apart.</font>

968
01:45:01,810 --> 01:45:04,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine what they could tell us.</font>

969
01:45:04,521 --> 01:45:06,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't imagine.</font>

970
01:45:06,315 --> 01:45:07,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither could the humans
that built this temple,</font>

971
01:45:07,899 --> 01:45:08,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and neither can you.</font>

972
01:45:09,067 --> 01:45:12,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Belief, Dr. Jones,
is a gift you have yet to receive.</font>

973
01:45:14,114 --> 01:45:15,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My sympathies.</font>

974
01:45:15,741 --> 01:45:19,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I believe, sister.
That's why I'm down here.</font>

975
01:45:54,196 --> 01:45:57,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mayan. He's speaking Mayan.
- What does he say?</font>

976
01:45:57,532 --> 01:46:00,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says he's grateful
and he wants ...</font>

977
01:46:02,329 --> 01:46:03,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It.</font>

978
01:46:06,792 --> 01:46:10,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wants to give us a gift.</font>

979
01:46:13,465 --> 01:46:15,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A big gift.</font>

980
01:46:16,635 --> 01:46:18,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me everything you know.</font>

981
01:46:22,808 --> 01:46:25,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to know everything.
I want to know.</font>

982
01:46:33,819 --> 01:46:36,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a bad feeling about this.</font>

983
01:46:40,992 --> 01:46:42,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy?</font>

984
01:46:43,161 --> 01:46:44,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The eyes.</font>

985
01:47:49,102 --> 01:47:50,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are they? Spacemen?</font>

986
01:47:51,229 --> 01:47:54,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Interdimensional beings,
in point of fact.</font>

987
01:47:54,733 --> 01:47:56,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome back, Ox.</font>

988
01:48:07,954 --> 01:48:09,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is that?</font>

989
01:48:09,706 --> 01:48:13,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A portal!
A pathway to another dimension!</font>

990
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:16,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think we want
to go that way.</font>

991
01:48:32,103 --> 01:48:36,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to know.</font>

992
01:48:37,609 --> 01:48:41,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me. I'm ready.
I want to know.</font>

993
01:48:47,536 --> 01:48:50,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mac! Mac! Come on!</font>

994
01:48:52,707 --> 01:48:53,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mac!</font>

995
01:48:56,294 --> 01:48:57,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mac, damn it, now!</font>

996
01:49:10,850 --> 01:49:12,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see.</font>

997
01:49:14,187 --> 01:49:15,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see!</font>

998
01:49:18,608 --> 01:49:19,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab it!</font>

999
01:49:24,698 --> 01:49:27,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Use your legs, Mac.
I can't do it alone.</font>

1000
01:49:29,411 --> 01:49:30,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jonesey!</font>

1001
01:49:32,289 --> 01:49:34,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to be all right.</font>

1002
01:49:42,966 --> 01:49:44,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more!</font>

1003
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:49,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover it. Cover it.</font>

1004
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:04,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

1005
01:50:04,487 --> 01:50:08,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough!</font>

1006
01:50:21,254 --> 01:50:22,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Go!</font>

1007
01:52:43,104 --> 01:52:45,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a broom to their footprints.</font>

1008
01:52:48,193 --> 01:52:51,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did they go? Space?</font>

1009
01:52:52,405 --> 01:52:57,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not into space.
Into the space between spaces.</font>

1010
01:53:06,377 --> 01:53:08,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand.</font>

1011
01:53:09,756 --> 01:53:12,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why this legend of a city of gold?</font>

1012
01:53:12,759 --> 01:53:15,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Ugha word for gold
translates as "treasure."</font>

1013
01:53:16,930 --> 01:53:20,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But their treasure wasn't gold.
It was knowledge.</font>

1014
01:53:20,934 --> 01:53:23,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knowledge was their treasure.</font>

1015
01:53:38,868 --> 01:53:41,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? We're just going to sit here?</font>

1016
01:53:41,246 --> 01:53:42,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Night falls quick in the jungle, kid.</font>

1017
01:53:42,997 --> 01:53:44,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want to
climb down the mountain in the dark.</font>

1018
01:53:44,999 --> 01:53:46,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No?</font>

1019
01:53:47,502 --> 01:53:51,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can. Who's coming with me?
Come on.</font>

1020
01:53:51,089 --> 01:53:53,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you stick around, Junior?</font>

1021
01:53:56,094 --> 01:53:59,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. Why didn't you, Dad?</font>

1022
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:02,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

1023
01:54:06,229 --> 01:54:07,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

1024
01:54:12,527 --> 01:54:15,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somewhere your grandpa is laughing.</font>

1025
01:54:31,796 --> 01:54:35,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marvelous! Perfect! Make the
letters bigger, much bigger.</font>

1026
01:54:48,229 --> 01:54:51,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry Jones, Jr.,
and Marion Ravenwood,</font>

1027
01:54:52,066 --> 01:54:57,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">insomuch in that you two have agreed
to live together in holy matrimony,</font>

1028
01:54:57,155 --> 01:55:00,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have promised your love for
each other by these vows ...</font>

1029
01:55:00,450 --> 01:55:03,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the joining of your hands
and the giving of these rings,</font>

1030
01:55:03,870 --> 01:55:06,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I now declare you
to be husband and wife.</font>

1031
01:55:07,665 --> 01:55:12,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whom God hath put together,
let no one tear asunder.</font>

1032
01:55:12,462 --> 01:55:15,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"How much of human life
is lost in waiting!"</font>

1033
01:55:16,549 --> 01:55:18,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations.</font>

1034
01:55:18,885 --> 01:55:21,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may kiss your bride.</font>

1035
01:55:41,574 --> 01:55:43,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done, Henry!</font>

1036
01:55:43,368 --> 01:55:45,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks, Ox.
- Thanks, Ox.</font>
