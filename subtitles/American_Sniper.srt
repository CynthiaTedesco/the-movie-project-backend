1
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:19,633
It's a fucking hotbox.

2
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:23,070
Man, the fucking dirt here
tastes like dog shit.

3
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,260
- Oh, well, you'd know, wouldn't you?
- Shut the fuck up.

4
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,376
I got a military-age male that's on
a cell phone watching the convoy, over.

5
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:23,164
<i>If you think he's reporting troop movement,
you have a green light. Your call. Over.</i>

6
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:26,518
Maybe he's just calling his old lady.

7
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:35,657
He stepped off.

8
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:48,970
Hold on. I got a woman and a kid,
200 yards out, moving towards the convoy.

9
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:56,398
Her arms aren't swinging.
She's carrying something.

10
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:06,910
Yeah, she's got a grenade.

11
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,280
She's got an RKG Russian grenade
she just handed to the kid.

12
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:12,231
<i>You say a woman and a kid?</i>

13
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:16,953
- You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?
- <i>Negative. You know the R.O.E. Your call.</i>

14
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:20,725
Man, they fry you if you're wrong.
They send your ass to Leavenworth.

15
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:40,324
You got him.

16
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:58,515
Hey, get back here!

17
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:04,118
- You don't ever leave your rifle in the dirt.
- Yes, sir.

18
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:13,147
That was a hell of a shot, son.
You got a gift.

19
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,196
You're gonna make a fine hunter someday.

20
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:19,837
Here in the book of acts,

21
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:23,779
several times, Paul stands in judgment

22
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,004
for what he believes.

23
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:28,175
And at times, we all have to do that.

24
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:30,691
I mean, we don't see with his eyes,

25
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,437
so we don't know the glory of his plan.

26
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:39,421
Our lives unfold before us
like puzzling reflections in a mirror.

27
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:42,687
- What are you doing?
- And on the day we rise...

28
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:48,095
we will see with clarity and understand
the mystery of his ways.

29
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:50,296
Let us pray.

30
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,335
There are three types of people
in this world...

31
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:58,427
sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs.

32
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:03,764
Now, some people prefer to believe
that evil doesn't exist in the world.

33
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:07,697
And if it ever darkened their doorstep,
they wouldn't know how to protect themselves.

34
00:05:07,797 --> 00:05:10,371
Those are the sheep.

35
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:12,234
And then you got predators.

36
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:16,856
They use violence to prey on the weak.
They're the wolves.

37
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:22,178
And then there are those who've been
blessed with the gift of aggression

38
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:25,165
and the overpowering need
to protect the flock.

39
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:31,038
These men are the rare breed
that live to confront the wolf.

40
00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:34,809
They are the sheepdog.

41
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,113
Now, we're not raising
any sheep in this family.

42
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,049
And I will whup your ass
if you turn into a wolf.

43
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:44,949
Wayne.

44
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:51,356
But we protect our own.

45
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:54,561
Now, if someone tries to fight you

46
00:05:54,811 --> 00:05:58,817
or tries to bully your little brother,
you have my permission to finish it.

47
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:01,436
The guy was picking on Jeff.

48
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:05,942
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir. Yes, he was.

49
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:09,514
Did you finish it?

50
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:15,430
Well, then you know who you are.

51
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:21,128
You know your purpose.

52
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,094
<i>Chris Kyle is on the horse
Big Mistress here this evening.</i>

53
00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:30,031
You're all right.

54
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:33,101
Now, get ready.

55
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,029
That's good.

56
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:41,608
<i>So, tonight, he needs to beat
the leading score of 86.</i>

57
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,963
Hey, Jeff. Looks like
your brother did it again.

58
00:07:13,063 --> 00:07:13,943
<i>...Chris Kyle.</i>

59
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:18,596
Man, wasn't nobody there.
You come out with a belt buckle.

60
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:21,483
- What are you supposed to do with it?
- Supposed to get laid with it.

61
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,569
I'm gonna wear it
and see if it puts Sarah in the mood.

62
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:25,404
Shit, a strong wind'll
put Sarah in the mood.

63
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:26,838
Oh, is that what they say?

64
00:07:26,938 --> 00:07:28,106
Man, you know what they
called her in high school.

65
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:30,175
- All right. Don't say it.
- Sarah sucks-a-lotta...

66
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,278
- What'd I say?
- Shit, Chris.

67
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:33,631
Goddamn it.

68
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:44,163
That was bucking money, those 2 girls.
And that's why... no.

69
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,927
He kept looking... he had his eyes on her,
and that's why, the last time...

70
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:50,029
- Wait till you see what this does.
- Yeah.

71
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:51,897
Let's see him go!

72
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:55,001
Hey, baby. Who wants to fuck
a rodeo star? What the fuck?

73
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:57,068
You said you wasn't coming home
until tomorrow.

74
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:58,436
- I said what?
- No, I just didn't...

75
00:07:58,536 --> 00:08:00,662
Chris, just leave him alone, all right?
He didn't do anything!

76
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:04,142
- I didn't know shit, man. Help!
- Chris, leave him alone!

77
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:08,681
Fucking Chris, leave him alone!
Goddamn it! What is wrong with you?

78
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:11,685
- He didn't know, all right?
- Oh, he didn't know? What didn't you know?

79
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,966
- Just give me my hat.
- Get his hat, baby.

80
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:16,356
He didn't know what?
Whose rifles did you think those were?

81
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:19,140
Those clothes, them men's clothes weren't hers?
Is that what you didn't know?

82
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,629
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
You don't have to fucking punch everyone!

83
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:26,014
Put that fucking hat on
and get the fuck out.

84
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,419
What the fuck is wrong with you?

85
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:32,939
Get out.

86
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,608
You know what?
I don't know what you expect from me.

87
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,579
You drag me out here and then you run off
with your brother every damn weekend.

88
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,948
Why do you think I did this?

89
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:45,599
I do this to get attention!
Don't you get that?

90
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,072
Get your stuff and get out.

91
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:54,377
Fine. Fine. You know what?
Fuck you. Fine.

92
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:57,663
You think you're a cowboy
'cause you rodeo.

93
00:08:57,763 --> 00:09:00,783
You're not a cowboy.
You're just a lousy ranch hand.

94
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,353
And you're a shitty fucking lay.

95
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:11,193
Don't say it.

96
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:13,129
When's the wedding?

97
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,306
I understand what you're saying, but...

98
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:22,338
you know, we get to travel
over the whole state.

99
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:25,310
Different city every weekend.

100
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:28,473
Broncs and steers.

101
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:31,799
- I don't know. Maybe she's right, though.
- She's right?

102
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:37,044
Right about what, Chris?
She's not right, man. We're cowboys.

103
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:39,140
- We're living the dream.
- <i>This is a special report.</i>

104
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,317
<i>Those explosions set to go off
at the U.S. embassies</i>

105
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:45,244
<i>in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania,
and Nairobi, Kenya,</i>

106
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:48,648
<i>were clearly a part of someone's war
against the United States.</i>

107
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:53,454
<i>More than 80 dead, more than 1,700 injured
in 2 bomb blasts today...</i>

108
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:56,090
Hey, Jeff. Jeff. Hey.

109
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,348
- <i>...250 miles apart.</i>
- Look at this.

110
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:01,845
<i>It is still unclear at this hour
who our enemy is.</i>

111
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:03,563
<i>Although the embassies
were obviously the targets...</i>

112
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:07,033
- Look what they did to us.
- <i>...and injured are not Americans.</i>

113
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:13,498
<i>Still, 8 Americans, including one child,
are dead, and 5 are still missing.</i>

114
00:10:17,543 --> 00:10:19,579
- So, you're from Texas.
- Yes, sir.

115
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,115
- You're a patriot.
- Yes, sir.

116
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:25,119
- And you're pissed off.
- I'm looking to be of service.

117
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:27,138
- You like to fight?
- Yes, sir.

118
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:31,645
You like to fight. Okay. Well...
Why don't you meet the warrior elite?

119
00:10:32,895 --> 00:10:35,813
- SEALS.
- Yep. Sea, air, and land.

120
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:37,665
Well, I'm not much for the water, sir.

121
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:41,494
No? Well, this ain't for the faint-a heart.
Most men, they wash out, they quit.

122
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:44,857
But I'm not most men, sir. I don't quit.

123
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:49,944
- <i>This is where the fun stops, guys!</i>
- Take it, girls! Take it!

124
00:10:50,044 --> 00:10:54,032
That's it, girls. Take it. Take it.
Only hurts the first time.

125
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:57,417
- What we got here? You a quitter, boy?
- Hooyah, no, instructor Rolle.

126
00:10:57,517 --> 00:11:00,155
Bullshit! Yo ass is fleet meat
if I ever did see it!

127
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:03,792
Don't turn away from me, son.
You look at me and you take this shit.

128
00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:06,460
- Hooyah, sir!
- Damn, you old as fuck!

129
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,929
You join the Navy 'cause you had
such a good goddamn time on Noah's ark?

130
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:11,176
- How old are you, boy?
- Hooyah, 30!

131
00:11:11,276 --> 00:11:14,785
30? Your fart dust
could have fathered half these boys.

132
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:17,206
We gonna weed through the quitters.

133
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:20,142
Yeah, we gonna find us
a goddamn warrior or 2 today.

134
00:11:20,242 --> 00:11:22,004
Dauber, are you sure
you're from Connecticut?

135
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:24,678
I ain't never met no hick
from Hartford before.

136
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:28,885
Hooyah, instructor Friday! Country's
countrywide. I came here to kill terrorists.

137
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:32,286
Who the fuck told your ass to giggle?

138
00:11:32,386 --> 00:11:34,306
Hooyah, no one, instructor Rolle!

139
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:37,658
- Did I ask you to open up your mouth?
- Hooyah, no, instructor Rolle.

140
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:40,695
Look at your fat, pasty, giggly ass.

141
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:45,001
Damn, son! You a big Dr. pepper,
cheeto-eating motherfucker.

142
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:47,704
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.

143
00:11:47,804 --> 00:11:52,524
Biggles. That's your name from now on,
sunshine. And that's your ticket home.

144
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:55,119
"D"! What are you still doing in my line,
trying to make this team?

145
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:59,195
- Everybody knows black guys don't swim.
- It's all right, sir. I'm not black.

146
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:01,132
- No?
- No. I'm the new black.

147
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:04,686
We run slow, we jump low,
we swim good, and we shop at gap.

148
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:08,874
And I make the white folk proud when
I hose down their ladies. I dick 'em down!

149
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:11,660
Hooyah!

150
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:15,614
There it is! That is a quitter.

151
00:12:16,364 --> 00:12:18,584
You say goodbye, I say good riddance.

152
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:21,820
He quits on you here,
he's gonna quit in the field of battle.

153
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,224
When shit gets hairy, he won't step up.
Your ass gets shot, he won't pull you out.

154
00:12:26,574 --> 00:12:28,344
I'm looking for warriors!

155
00:12:28,444 --> 00:12:30,763
- 7!
- Keep counting!

156
00:12:31,213 --> 00:12:33,504
- 8! 9!
- I can't hear you!

157
00:12:33,604 --> 00:12:37,320
You want me to call your Moma, old man?
Maybe she could come and take your place.

158
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,790
This is foreplay! I'm about to turn on
some Marvin Gaye and get in that ass!

159
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,426
That's what I'm talking about!

160
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:47,579
Squirrel, Squirrel, Squirrel,
where the fuck are your nuts?

161
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:50,967
Oh, they're gone for good, sir.
They crawled back up inside.

162
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,802
But they are warm.

163
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:54,936
Big talk from a little man!

164
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:59,003
Now you. How about you, old man?

165
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:01,228
How you feeling?

166
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:04,430
Hooyah, dangerous. Feeling dangerous.

167
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,702
Hooyah! Kyle's feeling dangerous.

168
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:09,836
<i>Move!</i>

169
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:16,897
<i>Take seats!</i>

170
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:25,143
Damn! 56 degrees, so fresh, so clean.

171
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,955
Only a few more hours,
and you're Navy SEALS!

172
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:43,186
- I'm the only one who's hit one, so...
- Yeah.

173
00:13:43,286 --> 00:13:44,971
Boom!

174
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:47,524
- Oh, yeah.
- Chris, your turn, man.

175
00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:49,526
- No, you got one more.
- I got one more? All right.

176
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:51,406
All right. One more.
Here we go. Here we go.

177
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:56,624
Hey, we want a smaller target,
we'll use your arm, man.

178
00:13:59,168 --> 00:14:02,155
- Hello.
- Hi.

179
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:04,307
How you doing?

180
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:05,995
Good. Thank you.

181
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:10,507
Can I... get you a drink?

182
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:14,419
Will a drink make you
6 inches taller and charming?

183
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,913
- Will it make you not married?
- I'm not...

184
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:20,190
Yeah. I just watched you
take your ring off, okay?

185
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,412
Don't be a scumbag. Go home.

186
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:27,583
Oh, my God.

187
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:33,755
- It may have been the leather pants.
- Oh, yeah?

188
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:37,508
What kind of pants does a girl
have to wear to be left alone?

189
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:40,043
Well, maybe corduroy.

190
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:42,112
I mean, is that how it is with you guys?

191
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:45,083
You're, like, suddenly single
after 3 beers?

192
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:47,802
Oh, no. After 3 beers,
all I know is to get a fourth.

193
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:51,988
Oh, that's great. That's great.
Real redneck.

194
00:14:52,088 --> 00:14:54,506
Oh, I'm not a redneck. I'm from Texas.

195
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:56,293
What's the difference?

196
00:14:56,393 --> 00:14:59,180
Well, we ride horses
and they ride their cousins.

197
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:02,099
What do you do for work?
You're obviously military.

198
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:04,735
I polish dolphins. They're in captivity.

199
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:06,703
What I do is just sort of
scrape off the crustaceans.

200
00:15:06,803 --> 00:15:11,081
- Do I look stupid to you?
- No. Honestly, you look a little sad.

201
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:19,165
- Am I... tall enough to buy you a drink?
- Not until you tell me what you do.

202
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:21,166
Okay. How about this? Hey, Greg?

203
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:23,390
Get 2 shots.
How 'bout we do a shot for a question?

204
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,808
Every time you ask me a question and I answer,
you got to do a shot. Same, vice versa.

205
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:28,143
Game on.

206
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:31,729
You can leave the bottle, too.
Okay, shoot.

207
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:35,400
All right. You're obviously military.
What branch?

208
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,537
I just finished BUD/S,
heading to sniper school.

209
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:42,258
- Are you kidding me? You're a SEAL?
- Yes, ma'am.

210
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:47,178
- That's 2 questions.
- Shit.

211
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,269
Really?

212
00:15:51,815 --> 00:15:54,295
Oh, I didn't really mean
you had to do that.

213
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,621
Okay. Shit.

214
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:59,574
I know all about you guys.
My sister was engaged to a SEAL.

215
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:02,195
- Oh, was she?
- Yeah.

216
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:05,262
Hold on. How you know all about us?
What do you mean?

217
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:09,019
What I mean is, you're a bunch of arrogant,
self-centered pricks who think you can lie

218
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:13,255
and cheat and do whatever the fuck you want.
I'd never date a SEAL.

219
00:16:14,595 --> 00:16:17,758
Wait. Why would you say I'm self-centered?
I'd lay down my life for my country.

220
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,245
Why?

221
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,680
'Cause it's the greatest country on earth,
and I'd do everything I can to protect it.

222
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,667
Look, I'm sorry what happened
to your sister, but that's not me.

223
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:30,556
- It's nice to meet you.
- Where are you going?

224
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,660
Well, I was just gonna go home because
you said you wouldn't date a SEAL, so...

225
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,847
I said I'd never marry one.

226
00:16:38,618 --> 00:16:42,602
Oh, okay. Well, then maybe, hello.
Nice to meet you. What's your name?

227
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,520
- Taya.
- Taya.

228
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,526
Chris. I'm Chris Kyle.
Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

229
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:54,096
I mean, it's pretty egotistical of you to think
you can protect us all. Isn't it, Chris?

230
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:58,868
Well, our BUD/S officer commander
said that it's three...

231
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:03,948
Okay. He said there's three things we got to
worry about: Ego, booze, and women.

232
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:08,125
Well, sounds like you're under attack.

233
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,431
You're pretty.

234
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,653
You're so cute.

235
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,305
I got you.

236
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,688
I'm not going home with you,
so don't even think about it.

237
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:48,419
Feel breath filling
every cell in your body.

238
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:52,356
This is our ritual.

239
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,393
We master our breath,
we master our mind.

240
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,213
Pulling the trigger
will become an unconscious effort.

241
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,117
You will be aware of it,
but not directing it.

242
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:06,953
And as you exhale,
find your natural respiratory pause

243
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,345
and the space between heartbeats.

244
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,476
<i>Hey. This is Taya. I can't get to the phone.
Leave a message. I'll call you back.</i>

245
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:33,013
<i>Hey, it's me again.
The guy whose shoes you puked on.</i>

246
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,850
<i>So... yeah, I was thinking
maybe you didn't get that last message,</i>

247
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,803
<i>the last message I left, or...
the one before that. So I figured that...</i>

248
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:44,375
- You figured what?
- <i>Hey. How are you? How've you been?</i>

249
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:45,993
Good.

250
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:50,030
<i>Good. Wow. What are you up to?</i>

251
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,950
Not a lot. You?

252
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:56,176
<i>No, just... excited to talk to you.</i>

253
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,775
Aim small, miss small.

254
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,399
If you aim for a shirt button,
you might miss by 2 inches.

255
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:12,185
If you aim for his shirt,
you might miss by 2 feet.

256
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:21,679
- You better close those groupings, Kyle.
- Yes, sir.

257
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,214
God.

258
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,204
- Not bad. What do we get for that?
- Top shelf.

259
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:31,340
- I like that one. Brown one.
- Sure. Here you go.

260
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,476
- Great. Thank you, sir. Have a good day.
- Oh, look! Thank you.

261
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:38,011
- Hello.
- Oh, good. That looks good on you.

262
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,942
So, did you always want to be a soldier?

263
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:43,459
No. I wanted to be a cowboy, but...

264
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,221
I don't know. I did that.
Thought I was meant for something more.

265
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:48,922
So you started rescuing girls from bars?

266
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,908
I think I rescued that bar from you.

267
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:57,381
- You like country music?
- Only when I'm depressed.

268
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:02,253
- How about kids? You want kids?
- Yeah, someday.

269
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,922
My mom says I have a nose
for picking the wrong men.

270
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,710
Well, that's a shitty thing
to say to a girl.

271
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,129
Well, I've proven her right.

272
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:14,781
Them wrong picks put you here,

273
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:18,590
made you who you are.
I like who you are.

274
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:23,875
You ever think about what happens when
there's a real person on the end of that gun?

275
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:27,774
I don't know. I just hope I can do my job
when that day comes.

276
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,280
Are we looking at the same target?
You're spitting dust.

277
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,968
And don't worry. We can always use corpsmen
for the guys who can't shoot.

278
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:51,794
Oh, fuck.

279
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:19,566
- You're trembling.
- I know it.

280
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:22,434
- We don't have to do this if you don't...
- No, I want to. I do.

281
00:21:22,684 --> 00:21:25,120
- Yeah?
- You just feel real and it scares me.

282
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:38,675
You got your off-eye shut?

283
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:41,404
Well, if I close my off-eye,
then I can't see what's out there.

284
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,408
- There's nothing out there but the target.
- Negative. Sir, there is something out there.

285
00:21:45,508 --> 00:21:46,993
Punch it.

286
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:51,601
Will push-ups help?
Give me 50, Kyle. Clear and safe.

287
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:00,907
I'm better when it's breathing.

288
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,928
- <i>...what appears to be another...</i>
- Oh, my God. Chris!

289
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:08,413
- What's wrong?
- No!

290
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:12,871
<i>Here's the tape. You see the first plane
coming in from what looks like the east side.</i>

291
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:15,414
<i>And it goes into the building
with the flames</i>

292
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:18,975
<i>and the smoke billowing out
the other side of the tower.</i>

293
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:23,246
<i>It's hard for me to tell exactly which is
the north side and which is the south side.</i>

294
00:22:23,346 --> 00:22:25,682
<i>But it appears it's coming out
of the north side there.</i>

295
00:22:25,782 --> 00:22:28,837
<i>And then, moments ago,
these incredible images.</i>

296
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:33,173
<i>I believe that's the first one.
That's the south tower collapsing.</i>

297
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:37,243
<i>It almost looks like one of those implosions
of buildings that you see,</i>

298
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:42,787
<i>except there is nothing controlled
about this. This is devastation.</i>

299
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:53,843
You don't even know me.

300
00:22:53,943 --> 00:22:57,255
I know enough.
You are a package deal, babe.

301
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:05,908
- What are you so afraid of?
- Nothing.

302
00:23:07,758 --> 00:23:11,312
Everything. I don't know.
What if it doesn't work out?

303
00:23:12,762 --> 00:23:16,133
We're gonna get married
and then we're gonna start a family.

304
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:19,547
You got it all planned out, don't you?

305
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:21,690
I'm done.

306
00:23:22,105 --> 00:23:23,847
I love you.

307
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:28,480
Well, you're gonna need a ring
if you want to talk all tough like that.

308
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,185
Okay.

309
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:43,276
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. Chris Kyle!</i>

310
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:55,466
What the hell is on your neck?

311
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:57,658
Your neck. You've got, like,
green paint all over you.

312
00:23:57,908 --> 00:24:00,267
Would you believe me, babe,
if I told you I had an I.V.

313
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,614
and I was all green about 2 hours ago?

314
00:24:02,714 --> 00:24:04,616
What are you... what?

315
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:07,419
- It's a package deal, babe.
- Oh, my God.

316
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,537
Come here, you.

317
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:12,873
Cheers to that.

318
00:24:13,123 --> 00:24:15,032
What's the word, chief?

319
00:24:15,482 --> 00:24:18,328
Just got the call, boys. It's on!

320
00:24:18,428 --> 00:24:20,510
Hooyah!

321
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,477
Shots!

322
00:24:23,738 --> 00:24:25,317
Yes!

323
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,248
5 shots.

324
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:31,444
Yeah!

325
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:36,911
- It's only gonna be 6 weeks, baby.
- I'm so afraid, baby.

326
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:39,317
That's what they say.
You got nothing to be afraid of.

327
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:41,215
- What are you...
- It's all part of the plan.

328
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:45,702
Your heart is beating out of your chest.

329
00:24:46,524 --> 00:24:49,777
That's just 'cause I'm not the only one
that's going to war. That's all.

330
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:52,749
Cheers!

331
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:09,313
Welcome to Fallujah.
The new wild west of the old Middle East.

332
00:25:09,413 --> 00:25:12,950
AQI put a price on your heads,
and now extremists from around the globe

333
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,695
are flooding the borders
to collect on it. You snipers...

334
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:21,027
you're gonna be paired with a marine to watch
your back and inserted along the main road

335
00:25:21,127 --> 00:25:24,296
to do overwatch for 1st marines
going door to door.

336
00:25:24,396 --> 00:25:27,333
Your job is to protect
those marines at all costs.

337
00:25:27,433 --> 00:25:29,601
This city has been evacuated.

338
00:25:29,701 --> 00:25:34,056
Any military-age male who is still here...
is here to kill you.

339
00:25:34,806 --> 00:25:38,577
Let's bring these boys in safe
and get our asses back home.

340
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:57,747
Out, out, out!

341
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:02,250
I'd keep that head down, Tex.

342
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,553
Muj got snipers, too, you know.

343
00:26:05,203 --> 00:26:08,192
A sniper won't aim for your head.

344
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:15,043
Man, they got this one sniper that's been
hitting head shots from 500 yards out.

345
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,202
They call him Mustafa.

346
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:24,290
He's in the Olympics.

347
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,449
They got sniping in the Olympics now?

348
00:26:40,774 --> 00:26:45,772
Hold on. I got a woman and a kid,
200 yards out, moving towards the convoy.

349
00:26:50,816 --> 00:26:53,153
Her arms aren't swinging.
She's carrying something.

350
00:27:02,995 --> 00:27:06,215
She's got a grenade. She's got an RKG
Russian grenade she just handed to the kid.

351
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:08,040
<i>You say a woman and a kid?</i>

352
00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:13,556
- You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?
<i>- Negative. You know the R.O.E. Your call.</i>

353
00:27:13,706 --> 00:27:17,696
Man, they fry you if you're wrong.
They send your ass to Leavenworth.

354
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,840
Fuck, that was gnarly.

355
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:02,840
Fucking evil bitch.

356
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,810
Get up. Keep moving.

357
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:09,915
- <i>Nice shooting, Tex. Hell of a call.</i>
- <i>Roger that. Good looking out, Navy.</i>

358
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:13,361
- Fuck, did you hear that, man?
- Get the fuck off me.

359
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:40,728
Where is everybody?

360
00:28:40,828 --> 00:28:44,565
We're just checking our dicks here, man.
We're training those fucking Hajji soldiers.

361
00:28:44,665 --> 00:28:45,882
Yeah, why aren't you out there?

362
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:51,238
- Well, I have the shits.
- What, reading a comic book?

363
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:54,529
It's a fucking graphic novel, man.
There's a big difference.

364
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:58,814
I heard you were
on fucking fire out there.

365
00:28:58,914 --> 00:29:03,093
Marc Lee came in, said you popped
your cherry. Is that right?

366
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:06,923
There was a kid who...
barely had any hair on his balls.

367
00:29:07,023 --> 00:29:09,375
Mother gives him a grenade,

368
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:11,993
sends him out there to kill marines.

369
00:29:17,498 --> 00:29:20,167
Dude, that's evil
like I never seen before.

370
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:22,441
Yeah. But, hey, man,

371
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:25,575
you know that kid could have taken out
like 10 fucking marines, right?

372
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:26,743
Yeah, but I killed him.

373
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:29,877
You did your job.
That's the end of the story.

374
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:33,630
Yeah, it's just not how I envisioned
that first one to go down.

375
00:29:36,338 --> 00:29:40,212
Riley, it's okay.
Don't have the actuals.

376
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,218
Fuck, man! What the hell?

377
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:56,991
That was your overwatch, Einstein.
You can thank him later.

378
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:02,094
Let's move!

379
00:30:02,544 --> 00:30:04,430
Keep going.

380
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,439
Hurry up.

381
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:21,554
Disperse!

382
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:31,809
Cease fire! Cease fire!

383
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:27,395
Eyes on the rooftop!
Keep your eyes up there!

384
00:32:46,544 --> 00:32:50,415
Man down! Man down!
We need a corpsman over here now!

385
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:53,895
<i>Enemy sniper located.
Approximate grid, Quebec-Romeo,</i>

386
00:32:53,995 --> 00:32:57,239
<i>1-5-5-6-0-4.</i>

387
00:33:04,394 --> 00:33:07,427
- Smells like piss in here.
- Yeah, well...

388
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,811
You covered our asses out there, man.
Some ballsy shots.

389
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:13,955
- Fuck. They were clean, right?
- Hell yeah, they were.

390
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:16,473
That fucking sniper
went right up our ass!

391
00:33:16,573 --> 00:33:19,090
Yeah, I already chewed out security detail.
It ain't gonna happen again.

392
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,711
It better not happen again.

393
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:22,980
- There's a hot spot 400 meters out.
- All right.

394
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,683
I'm gonna go write up
some shooter statements.

395
00:33:24,783 --> 00:33:28,119
- How many'd you get?
- I got 6... oh. No, that's not true.

396
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:31,700
I got 8, but they dragged 2 off.

397
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,461
- You got 6?
- Yeah. Why? What's wrong?

398
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:36,827
Nothing. You just got more
than the rest of the snipers combined.

399
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:40,472
- Yeah, but they got one of us.
- You can't shoot what you can't see.

400
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:44,853
His wife said he was carrying a Koran.

401
00:33:44,953 --> 00:33:49,140
Look, I don't know what a Koran looks like,
but I can tell you what he was carrying.

402
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,643
It was pressed metal, shot 7.62s,

403
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:54,903
and it looked just like an AK-47.
So you tell me what he was carrying.

404
00:34:06,876 --> 00:34:08,160
Oh, here he comes. Here he comes.

405
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,162
Ladies and genitals, listen up!
We have a legend in our midst!

406
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:13,998
Round of applause for The Legend!

407
00:34:14,098 --> 00:34:17,001
There we go. We're so proud of you
back home on the range, boy.

408
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:20,005
Now, it's been... it's been said
that The Legend here

409
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:22,907
can kill 100 men with one blow.

410
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:25,090
Or, no, it was... what was...
nah, it was... fuck. What was it?

411
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:30,431
It was one... one blow from a single man.
He blew 100... men.

412
00:34:30,581 --> 00:34:34,303
And he's single. And...
Goddamn it! Shit!

413
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:35,938
Oh, shit!

414
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:37,722
- Damn, man.
- Oh, fuck.

415
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:40,192
You want a food fight? Come on.

416
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:44,252
- Shit.
- Only way to shut you up.

417
00:34:45,964 --> 00:34:48,266
<i>Have you killed anyone yet?</i>

418
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:52,604
That is not the way the call home
is supposed to go, babe.

419
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:57,625
Don't be weird with me. Seriously.
I want you to tell me everything.

420
00:34:58,675 --> 00:35:01,857
Well, there's certain things
you just can't say over the phone.

421
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,749
Okay, you knocked me up, right?

422
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:06,819
And I'm sitting here by myself
literally assembling baby cribs,

423
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:10,673
and you can't talk to me?
That's your big plan?

424
00:35:12,842 --> 00:35:15,311
<i>You guys almost done over there yet?</i>

425
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:19,349
I can't stop thinking about that little
pink number you wore on our honeymoon.

426
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:23,553
Yeah, it's called a nightgown.

427
00:35:23,993 --> 00:35:25,561
<i>Yeah.</i>

428
00:35:26,206 --> 00:35:28,221
And 3 days...

429
00:35:28,321 --> 00:35:31,244
<i>3 days is not a honeymoon.</i>

430
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:34,330
Well, it was a good 3 days.

431
00:35:38,383 --> 00:35:40,753
I miss you real bad.

432
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:42,639
<i>I miss you, too.</i>

433
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:46,292
- Hey, you want me to talk dirty to you?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

434
00:35:46,392 --> 00:35:49,305
<i>Hold on. Hold on a second.
Let me just...</i>

435
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:54,901
I got... a phone in one hand
and a gun in the other,

436
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:56,465
so I don't know what I'm gonna do.

437
00:35:56,565 --> 00:35:59,401
Well, you're gonna have to decide
what's more important, baby.

438
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:03,476
Oh, you're a horny preggers.

439
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:06,879
<i>Fat and horny. It's fucking disgusting.</i>

440
00:36:06,979 --> 00:36:09,666
If you were 300 pounds,
I'd still do you.

441
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:12,832
So romantic.

442
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:17,474
- <i>How's my boy?</i>
- Nobody said it's a boy.

443
00:36:17,574 --> 00:36:20,461
I can't wait to see the way
you're gonna be with him.

444
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:22,114
<i>How do you know?</i>

445
00:36:23,664 --> 00:36:25,899
I just know.

446
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:27,618
I can sense it.

447
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:32,173
- I hope you're right.
- <i>Baby, I am right.</i>

448
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:38,146
- Hey, did your dad get ahold of you?
- <i>I haven't checked my e-mails.</i>

449
00:36:38,246 --> 00:36:42,209
Shit! Okay, you need to hang up
and call him, all right?

450
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:45,268
- <i>Why? What's wrong?</i>
- Fuck. I'm so selfish. I wasn't even thinking.

451
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:48,902
Taya, what's wrong? What happened?

452
00:36:49,956 --> 00:36:51,709
Your little brother deployed.

453
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:53,760
What do you mean?
What happened to jump school?

454
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,897
No, he didn't get in. You just hang up
and call your dad, okay?

455
00:36:56,997 --> 00:37:00,351
Wait. What do you mean?
Deployed where? Where is he?

456
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:02,653
<i>Over there.</i>

457
00:37:03,536 --> 00:37:05,940
<i>He's headed to Iraq.</i>

458
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,158
<i>I'm sorry, honey.</i>

459
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,549
The man with the blade,
he's a Jordanian militant.

460
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:18,185
He's funded by bin Laden.
He's trained by bin Laden.

461
00:37:18,285 --> 00:37:20,555
He is loyal to bin Laden.

462
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:24,225
His name is Zarqawi.

463
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:28,846
Now, this asshole is right now
the crown prince of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

464
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:33,768
His mercenary army, AQI,
they're 5,000 strong.

465
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:35,920
Now, these guys
are not your average shit-kickers.

466
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,407
These guys are well trained,
they are well paid.

467
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:43,428
And right now, they are waging
the largest urban assault since Vietnam.

468
00:37:43,853 --> 00:37:47,965
Zarqawi and his lieutenants,
these are our top priority.

469
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:51,086
Now, there is only one way
to root these guys out,

470
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,222
and that is to go door to door,
house to house,

471
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:58,776
until we find them or we find someone
who will give us their whereabouts.

472
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:03,282
So, we are going to need to clear
10 structures an hour,

473
00:38:03,432 --> 00:38:06,368
which, I know, is a lot.
It's aggressive.

474
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:09,537
We're gonna be loosening things up
with air support.

475
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:13,575
This is the highest priority target
we have to date.

476
00:38:13,675 --> 00:38:18,696
I want this asshole dead or captured.
Do you understand?

477
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:21,310
Are there any questions?

478
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:27,089
I'll tell you something. These marines
keep rushing in like they're doing,

479
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:29,757
- they're gonna have their asses shot off.
- Well, they're marines.

480
00:38:29,857 --> 00:38:32,826
They don't get the training we do.
Half these guys were civilians 6 months ago.

481
00:38:32,926 --> 00:38:35,563
Well, let's coach them up.
I'll show them how team guys do it.

482
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:38,566
- I'll lead the unit on the street.
- No, can't do that. We need you on overwatch.

483
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:40,468
Oh, come on.
If I'm on the street, Marc, I could...

484
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:45,342
House-to-house is the deadliest job here.
You got some sort of savior complex?

485
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:48,244
No, I just want to get the bad guys.
But if I can't see them, I can't shoot them.

486
00:38:48,344 --> 00:38:51,881
Look, all these guys, they know your name.
And they feel invincible with you up there.

487
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:54,985
- They're not.
- They are if they think they are.

488
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:59,582
Why don't you keep banging on the long gun?
We'll let these dogs sniff out Zarqawi.

489
00:39:09,532 --> 00:39:12,266
You said AQI has a sniper
in the Olympics,

490
00:39:12,366 --> 00:39:15,220
but Iraq hasn't qualified
a shooter in three games.

491
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,425
Well, that's 'cause Mustafa's not Iraqi.

492
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,369
He's from Syria.

493
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,052
Regroup!

494
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:35,623
Hey, once you all gain entry,
I can't see shit.

495
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:38,294
So take it slow
and move through your target.

496
00:39:38,394 --> 00:39:41,313
- <i>Understood.</i>
- Fire in the hole!

497
00:39:41,563 --> 00:39:43,650
Go, go, go!

498
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:02,504
Fuck this.

499
00:40:03,354 --> 00:40:06,190
I'm gonna go clear houses with marines.

500
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,842
- You coming?
- Fuck no, I'm not coming.

501
00:40:10,092 --> 00:40:13,729
No, man. I like my life.
I'd actually like to make it home alive.

502
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:16,099
Look, it's not my job to go fucking
knocking down doors, all right?

503
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:18,970
Those guys picked the wrong fucking job.
I'm not doing that shit.

504
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:22,173
All right, well,
if I don't see you down there,

505
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:23,941
you make sure I don't see you again.

506
00:40:30,481 --> 00:40:33,248
Hey. Y'all mind if I roll with you?

507
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,269
Hey, man. Any SEAL is cool by me.

508
00:40:36,752 --> 00:40:39,556
You're that guy, the one they're calling
The Legend. You got like 24 confirmed kills.

509
00:40:39,656 --> 00:40:42,758
- Well, who's counting?
- That's fucking bad-ass.

510
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:45,396
Yeah, I heard some motherfucker
in Bravo's catching up, yo.

511
00:40:45,496 --> 00:40:48,065
Listen. I know y'all are meat-eaters,
for sure, but I know a couple things,

512
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:50,701
some simple shit I could show you.
Maybe keep us above ground. What do you say?

513
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:52,708
- Yeah.
- All right.

514
00:40:52,808 --> 00:40:54,405
Right on.

515
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,433
- Hey, what's that mean, bro?
- Breacher up.

516
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:09,553
- Moving.
- Get down! Get down on the ground right now!

517
00:41:09,653 --> 00:41:11,640
- Get your fucking ass down!
- No, no!

518
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:14,358
- He no understand!
- Get down!

519
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:18,096
Why are you here? You're supposed to be
evacuating this area. Why are you still here?

520
00:41:18,196 --> 00:41:21,432
- I am Sheikh Al-Obeidi.
- Sheik Alla-who?! Who the fuck are you?!

521
00:41:21,532 --> 00:41:24,136
- This is my home! I stay!
- I don't give a fuck it's your home!

522
00:41:24,236 --> 00:41:26,405
- This is a war zone, sir!
- Sir, please!

523
00:41:26,505 --> 00:41:29,641
- Get that kid down!
- No! No!

524
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:31,911
- You, sir. Let me help you.
- Found these bitches in the back closet.

525
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:33,828
You are welcome here. You are my guest.

526
00:41:33,928 --> 00:41:36,648
- How many more you have here?!
- But tell the soldiers to come in.

527
00:41:36,748 --> 00:41:39,683
No. This Hajji just wants us all
in here so he can blow us up.

528
00:41:39,783 --> 00:41:42,688
- Go check his ass for a...
- If he see American, he know we speak.

529
00:41:42,788 --> 00:41:45,923
- Who? Who? Who saw you talking to us?
- It's very dangerous. Please come in.

530
00:41:46,023 --> 00:41:48,898
- Who knows we're talking to you? Who?!
- He come. He come.

531
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:52,329
He... he come. He...

532
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:56,233
Very bad. Please.

533
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:57,968
- This target's secure?
- Target secure.

534
00:41:58,068 --> 00:42:01,345
Bring them in. Get your head down on
the ground. Put your hands behind your back.

535
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:03,174
Now! Move now!

536
00:42:03,274 --> 00:42:05,532
- Please! Please!
- You talk, we'll talk to you.

537
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,634
Bring him in the other room.

538
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,358
If he talks to U.S. soldiers, they will come
to his house and make examples of them.

539
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,972
He? Who's he? Who's he?

540
00:42:26,284 --> 00:42:28,701
The man who comes, they call "The Butcher."
He's the despaired one.

541
00:42:28,801 --> 00:42:30,970
Son of Shaytan, son of... son of devil.

542
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,252
Oh, he's like an enforcer?

543
00:42:34,403 --> 00:42:35,274
Yes, enforcer.

544
00:42:35,374 --> 00:42:37,643
- Number-one soldier Zarqawi.
- Zarqawi?

545
00:42:37,743 --> 00:42:39,771
- Zarqawi.
- Yeah, we'd like to know where Zarqawi is.

546
00:42:39,871 --> 00:42:42,548
You know where he is?
You tell us where he is right now.

547
00:42:42,648 --> 00:42:44,216
How can we get him?

548
00:42:44,316 --> 00:42:47,920
Do you have information for us
about Zarqawi? Tell us right now.

549
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,614
You find the Butcher, you find Zarqawi.
He reports to him.

550
00:42:50,714 --> 00:42:53,131
Okay, well, how do we find him?

551
00:42:54,926 --> 00:42:57,947
All right, look at me when I'm talking
to you. Where do we find him?

552
00:43:00,066 --> 00:43:02,779
We must understand the risk to them,
but he will ask for money.

553
00:43:06,205 --> 00:43:09,006
- $100,000.
- You need $100,000?

554
00:43:09,106 --> 00:43:11,939
I have no proof this guy exists.

555
00:43:12,911 --> 00:43:14,814
Fatima!

556
00:43:14,914 --> 00:43:16,558
Howdy.

557
00:43:20,753 --> 00:43:22,267
Hello.

558
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:29,125
This is the proof.

559
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:31,355
All right, look, I wanna help you out.
I do. But I need something.

560
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:36,017
I need phone numbers, address, names.
You have to give me something.

561
00:43:36,335 --> 00:43:39,705
- Sir. First platoon's pinned down.
- Let's move out!

562
00:43:39,805 --> 00:43:43,643
Sheikh, look at me when I'm talking to you.
Hey! Look at me! I need something.

563
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,879
I can help you out, Sheikh.

564
00:43:45,979 --> 00:43:48,281
You give me a name,
and we will take care of it.

565
00:43:48,381 --> 00:43:50,383
I can promise you that.
We will give you safety.

566
00:43:50,483 --> 00:43:54,169
- Tell me right now!
- Amir Khalaf Fanus!

567
00:43:54,419 --> 00:43:56,056
- Emile Anafanoos?
- Amir Khalaf Fanus.

568
00:43:56,156 --> 00:43:58,441
This is the given name of the Butcher.

569
00:43:58,891 --> 00:44:01,845
We believe that the Butcher
is Zarqawi's number 2 man.

570
00:44:02,195 --> 00:44:03,729
This is your guy right here.

571
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:07,331
Yeah, but you don't know his real name.
Otherwise, you'd have written it up there.

572
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:09,653
We got several aliases.

573
00:44:10,847 --> 00:44:13,172
Now, if "Fanus" is legit...

574
00:44:13,272 --> 00:44:17,676
- We'll... we'll go see the Sheikh.
- He's asking for 100,000.

575
00:44:17,776 --> 00:44:21,180
Figures. But if he delivers the Butcher,
he's gonna get it.

576
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,918
This is agent Snead, DIA. I need
a name check on an Amir Khalaf Fanus.

577
00:44:27,018 --> 00:44:28,855
Yeah, I'll wait.

578
00:44:28,955 --> 00:44:31,357
If we're gonna go back out there,
team 3 can pull security.

579
00:44:31,457 --> 00:44:34,710
That's not gonna happen. Head shed's gonna
want contractors on it if we're humping money.

580
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,749
Yeah, I'm here. What do you got?

581
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:43,786
All right. Okay.

582
00:44:45,204 --> 00:44:47,502
Let's go see the Sheikh.

583
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:05,325
Roadkill.

584
00:45:05,425 --> 00:45:07,960
You know the Butcher
is Zarqawi's enforcer?

585
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:11,547
They say his weapon of choice
is a fucking drill.

586
00:45:11,997 --> 00:45:15,586
Went to seminary school
before I joined the Navy.

587
00:45:16,036 --> 00:45:18,172
Was close to being a preacher.

588
00:45:18,272 --> 00:45:20,889
And why didn't you?

589
00:45:21,507 --> 00:45:23,811
I love to gamble, man.

590
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:26,228
Love those dice.

591
00:45:26,514 --> 00:45:27,857
That's my kind of preacher.

592
00:45:43,764 --> 00:45:45,404
It's like that now?

593
00:45:45,504 --> 00:45:48,585
Oh, haven't you heard? I'm The Legend.

594
00:45:49,035 --> 00:45:50,020
Hey, babe.

595
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:53,190
You were right.
The doctor says it's a boy.

596
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,624
What?

597
00:45:56,073 --> 00:45:57,561
It's a boy!

598
00:45:58,011 --> 00:46:00,209
It's a boy?!

599
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:03,136
Hell, yeah, man. Congratulations!

600
00:46:18,365 --> 00:46:19,817
Chris?!

601
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:22,661
Grab the money! Get to the drop!

602
00:46:30,711 --> 00:46:33,160
Go! Go! Grab the bag! Grab the bag!

603
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:37,073
Chris!

604
00:46:42,423 --> 00:46:45,586
Go! Go! Get the fuck outta here!
We'll come back for them.

605
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,065
Baby?

606
00:46:50,165 --> 00:46:52,065
- I heard one shot.
- Check.

607
00:46:52,165 --> 00:46:55,821
Came in at an angle.
Be 300 or more yards out.

608
00:46:55,971 --> 00:46:57,192
Oh, my God.

609
00:47:00,942 --> 00:47:03,790
- You got a bead on him?
- I got a tiny little window.

610
00:47:05,766 --> 00:47:10,528
Shit! I got eyes on the Butcher.
He's got the Sheikh's kid on the avenue.

611
00:47:17,525 --> 00:47:19,026
Requesting QRF.

612
00:47:19,126 --> 00:47:22,631
We're being pinned down by sniper fire
on approach of high value target.

613
00:47:22,731 --> 00:47:26,543
Grid 04536236. Over.

614
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:29,504
I wanna pop a smoke 'em and secure
this building. I'm going to the roof.

615
00:47:34,043 --> 00:47:36,101
Hold up!

616
00:47:41,117 --> 00:47:43,353
- Hold.
- Holding.

617
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:46,609
Go!

618
00:47:51,959 --> 00:47:55,279
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

619
00:49:42,804 --> 00:49:45,742
Come on, you fucking son of a bitch!

620
00:49:45,842 --> 00:49:47,768
Fuck you!

621
00:49:57,788 --> 00:49:59,974
Jesus Christ, what a fucking mess.

622
00:50:00,524 --> 00:50:04,019
You're one dumb son of a bitch, you know that?
What the hell were you thinking?

623
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:07,297
You completely failed
to secure the battlefield.

624
00:50:07,397 --> 00:50:10,101
I'm shutting this whole thing down
pending an inquiry. Get back to base!

625
00:50:10,201 --> 00:50:14,371
- Hey, we gotta set up a squad and pursue him.
- Nope, they're shutting us down.

626
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:15,705
What do you mean?

627
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:17,909
Can't leave the wire
till they figure this shit out.

628
00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:23,471
Well, he can't just leave us like that.
Hey! I go home in 3 weeks!

629
00:50:24,314 --> 00:50:27,080
Man, that's gonna be a long 3 weeks.

630
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:07,511
- How are you?
- What's going on, pop?

631
00:51:14,331 --> 00:51:15,887
Hey.

632
00:51:19,737 --> 00:51:21,681
Hey, baby.

633
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,009
I thought you were dead.

634
00:51:25,109 --> 00:51:27,563
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

635
00:51:27,713 --> 00:51:31,066
- I thought you were dead.
- Well, I'm right here.

636
00:51:35,087 --> 00:51:37,026
Look at me.

637
00:51:40,292 --> 00:51:41,944
- You all right?
- Yeah.

638
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,883
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

639
00:52:04,983 --> 00:52:08,052
I have an alien growing inside me.

640
00:52:09,345 --> 00:52:14,252
- And there's a strange man in my bedroom.
- Well, it's our bedroom.

641
00:52:18,063 --> 00:52:20,020
Your hands feel different.

642
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,355
Oh, no. They're... they're my hands.

643
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,705
- Why am I so fucking nervous?
- Well, I am, too.

644
00:52:29,805 --> 00:52:32,411
- No, you're not. You're lying.
- Yes, I am. I swear.

645
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:36,015
How do I know some alien in there
is not gonna come out and grab me?

646
00:52:36,115 --> 00:52:37,883
In the middle of the night.

647
00:52:37,983 --> 00:52:40,143
Then I'm gonna have to...

648
00:52:41,052 --> 00:52:43,546
choke him out.

649
00:52:46,825 --> 00:52:48,027
It's gonna be okay.

650
00:52:48,127 --> 00:52:50,766
- Promise?
- Yeah, of course.

651
00:52:52,866 --> 00:52:55,725
Why're you so good with me?

652
00:53:02,908 --> 00:53:05,894
Hey, babe. It might be nice to get out.

653
00:53:06,344 --> 00:53:08,065
You listening to me?

654
00:53:09,015 --> 00:53:10,632
Chris.

655
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,737
What do you wanna do today, hon?

656
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:21,109
I thought we could just relax here.

657
00:53:23,562 --> 00:53:25,950
Okay, we do that.

658
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,414
Let's relax.

659
00:53:30,122 --> 00:53:33,172
- What're you doing?
- Putting my foot on you.

660
00:53:33,272 --> 00:53:36,622
Well, you know that's...
that's the way to my heart.

661
00:53:38,277 --> 00:53:40,472
I'm coming over.

662
00:53:49,356 --> 00:53:51,292
And that looks great.

663
00:53:51,392 --> 00:53:53,720
Look. He's touching his nose.

664
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,976
- How are you feeling?
- I'm all right. I just want him out. I'm tired.

665
00:53:57,076 --> 00:53:59,766
- Well, it's gonna be any day now.
- I hope so.

666
00:53:59,866 --> 00:54:01,969
How 'bout you, Mr. Kyle?
How're you feeling?

667
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:03,703
I'm feeling good. Thank you, ma'am.

668
00:54:03,803 --> 00:54:06,722
I imagine it's hard to decompress.

669
00:54:07,737 --> 00:54:09,275
Not really. No.

670
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:11,878
This is the first time
we've left the house.

671
00:54:11,978 --> 00:54:14,401
I'm happy to be home. Yeah.

672
00:54:16,851 --> 00:54:20,370
Here, put this on for me, would ya?

673
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:23,525
I think if you wanna check anything out,
you may wanna check out these knees.

674
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:25,654
- Are you a smoker?
- No, ma'am.

675
00:54:25,754 --> 00:54:28,545
- You drink?
- Only when I'm thirsty.

676
00:54:35,702 --> 00:54:37,270
That's 170/110.

677
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:40,774
- Jesus Christ, Chris.
- Is that high?

678
00:54:40,874 --> 00:54:44,578
Not if you've just had 14 cups of coffee.
But for someone who is sitting down...

679
00:54:44,678 --> 00:54:48,504
Oh, I appreciate you... taking a look
at that. I'll look into it.

680
00:54:48,604 --> 00:54:51,019
- Thank you.
- Will you look into it?

681
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,706
Yeah.

682
00:54:54,674 --> 00:54:55,823
You sabotaged me back there.

683
00:54:55,923 --> 00:54:59,128
What am I supposed to do? You're not talking.
You act like it's all okay.

684
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:01,764
- It is okay. I'm fine.
- You're not fine, Chris, all right?

685
00:55:01,864 --> 00:55:05,547
Your blood pressure is, like,
fucking 170/110. It's like...

686
00:55:05,647 --> 00:55:09,178
I'm driving down the freeway.
It's sunny. It's 72 degrees.

687
00:55:09,278 --> 00:55:11,606
I'm fine. There's a war going on.
There's people dying.

688
00:55:11,706 --> 00:55:13,842
No one's even talking about that.
It's like it's not even happening.

689
00:55:13,942 --> 00:55:18,067
We're all on our cell phones,
living our simple, simplistic lives.

690
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:21,015
- It's not even on the news. No one cares.
- Chris.

691
00:55:21,115 --> 00:55:22,845
There's a war going on
and I'm headed to the mall.

692
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:25,327
- Chris. It's happening.
- I'm not supposed to be here.

693
00:55:25,427 --> 00:55:27,789
- What's wrong? You okay?
- It's happening.

694
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:29,807
Shit. Okay. I'm gonna go back.

695
00:55:33,737 --> 00:55:37,515
- You're fucking crazy! You know that?
- It's okay. Hey! Baby, baby.

696
00:55:37,865 --> 00:55:42,119
- Oh, my God. Baby.
- You look beautiful.

697
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:44,856
It's fucking happening.

698
00:55:46,474 --> 00:55:49,497
Oh, my baby.

699
00:55:52,347 --> 00:55:54,558
Look at your Moma.

700
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,352
- Hey.
- Hi, baby.

701
00:55:57,452 --> 00:56:01,106
- Hey, little guy.
- Hey, baby.

702
00:56:01,757 --> 00:56:05,294
Hey, little guy. Look what we did.

703
00:56:05,394 --> 00:56:08,397
Look what we did. Look what we made.

704
00:56:08,497 --> 00:56:10,615
Look what we made.

705
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,880
The baby's crying.
I thought you were gonna get him.

706
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,900
No, don't bother turning it off.
I already watched it.

707
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:30,987
Had to make sure you didn't have an Iraqi
girlfriend sending you sexy videos.

708
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:33,179
That's a sniper recording his kills.
That's Mustafa.

709
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:36,022
He sells that shit on the street.
Those are American soldiers.

710
00:56:37,493 --> 00:56:42,113
That day that we were on the phone,
was that him? Was it?

711
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:47,269
Chris, just talk about it. You're not
protecting me by not talking about it.

712
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:49,137
No, I don't want you getting that
in your head, ya understand?

713
00:56:49,237 --> 00:56:51,974
Well, my imagination is so much worse
than anything you could tell me.

714
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:54,271
- Chris.
- Babe, They're fucking savages.

715
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:55,804
It's not about them.

716
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:59,132
It's about us.

717
00:57:00,324 --> 00:57:01,232
What?

718
00:57:06,621 --> 00:57:09,246
You have to make it back to us.

719
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:15,324
Okay?

720
00:57:18,254 --> 00:57:21,821
Welcome home, chief. Colonel Jones
is waiting. How was the flight?

721
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:24,622
- Damn longer than Christmas.
- I bet.

722
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:32,299
- Hey. Can you wait a second?
- All right. Hurry up.

723
00:57:33,549 --> 00:57:35,419
Hey, grunt!

724
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:39,021
- Chris?
- Hey, brother!

725
00:57:39,121 --> 00:57:40,624
Hi.

726
00:57:41,734 --> 00:57:43,059
You all right? You in one piece?

727
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:46,799
I heard you been kicking ass out here, man.
All the guys, that's what they've been saying.

728
00:57:46,899 --> 00:57:48,665
- Yeah, that's what they say?
- Yeah.

729
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:51,268
How ya doing? You okay?
Oh, shit, it's good to see you.

730
00:57:51,368 --> 00:57:54,872
You're my hero, bro. Okay?
You always have been.

731
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,506
Let's go, Kyle! Colonel's waiting!

732
00:57:57,606 --> 00:57:59,592
The Legend?

733
00:58:01,475 --> 00:58:04,347
- What happened? You all right?
- Man, I'm gonna miss my ride.

734
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:06,782
Hey, what happened?

735
00:58:06,882 --> 00:58:11,589
I'm just tired, man.
I'm... I'm going home.

736
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:13,686
I'm proud of you.

737
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:18,678
Dad is, too. Dad's proud of you.

738
00:58:19,728 --> 00:58:21,613
Fuck this place.

739
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:26,924
- What'd you say?
- Fuck this place.

740
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:34,149
Chief, we got to move! Let's go!

741
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:58,818
- You made chief. Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

742
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:03,491
Gronski's gone. A lot of the top brass are.
Running off a new playbook now.

743
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:06,677
I've studied insurgencies
for the last decade.

744
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:10,706
I know every stone thrown
since before the first century.

745
00:59:10,806 --> 00:59:15,119
These wars are won and lost
in the minds of our enemy.

746
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,070
Yes, sir.

747
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,039
That you?

748
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:22,259
That's a crusader cross. Yes, sir.

749
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:23,860
Yeah.

750
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,167
You're now the most wanted man in Iraq.

751
00:59:26,267 --> 00:59:28,781
There's 180,000 on your head. Congrats.

752
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:32,662
Well, don't tell my wife.
She might take that number right now.

753
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:37,242
I understand you wanna put together
a direct action squad to hunt the Butcher.

754
00:59:37,342 --> 00:59:38,693
Yes, sir.

755
00:59:39,747 --> 00:59:43,181
We got some Intel indicating
his area of operations.

756
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:47,485
I want you to put the fear
of God into these savages...

757
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:49,920
and find his ass.

758
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,840
Yes, sir.

759
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:55,322
All right,
let's go get this motherfucker.

760
00:59:56,294 --> 00:59:58,563
Gonna be a pop quiz before we leave.

761
00:59:58,663 --> 01:00:00,597
- Small words next time, big legend.
- What'd you say?

762
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:02,132
Small words next time.

763
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:04,067
I'll tell you those stories
if you want 'em.

764
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,722
- One hell of a PowerPoint, man.
- Oh, thanks, Biggles.

765
01:00:06,872 --> 01:00:08,874
Always gotta say something,
motherfucker.

766
01:00:08,974 --> 01:00:12,944
- That Bible of yours, is that bulletproof?
- What, the one I put in here?

767
01:00:13,044 --> 01:00:17,032
Yeah. I just... I never saw you
open it. I assumed...

768
01:00:18,182 --> 01:00:20,993
God, country, family, right?

769
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:23,107
You got a God?

770
01:00:24,957 --> 01:00:27,825
I got a God? You getting weird on me?

771
01:00:29,895 --> 01:00:32,597
You know, growing up in Oregon, we had
this electric fence around our property.

772
01:00:32,697 --> 01:00:36,117
Us kids'd grab onto it
and see who could hold on the longest.

773
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:39,337
War feels kinda like that.

774
01:00:39,437 --> 01:00:43,693
Puts lightning in your bones and makes it
hard to hold on to anything else.

775
01:00:44,543 --> 01:00:46,282
Hey, man, you need to sit this one out?

776
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:50,517
I just wanna believe
in what we're doing here.

777
01:00:50,617 --> 01:00:53,203
Oh, there's evil here. We've seen it.

778
01:00:53,753 --> 01:00:55,537
Yeah. There's evil everywhere.

779
01:00:55,787 --> 01:00:58,941
Oh, you want these motherfuckers
to come to San Diego or New York?

780
01:00:59,898 --> 01:01:02,580
We're protecting more
than just this dirt.

781
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,332
All right.

782
01:01:06,432 --> 01:01:08,690
Let's go kill this fucker.

783
01:01:19,344 --> 01:01:21,901
Bingo. It's the building right here.

784
01:01:22,001 --> 01:01:25,366
Any apartment on the east side
faces the restaurant.

785
01:01:27,285 --> 01:01:30,115
Go in, sir. Go, go, go.

786
01:01:31,423 --> 01:01:32,617
Clear.

787
01:01:43,335 --> 01:01:45,227
Other door.

788
01:01:53,979 --> 01:01:56,265
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- Get down on the ground right now.

789
01:01:56,815 --> 01:01:59,608
- Put your hands behind your back.
- Okay.

790
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:07,995
Target secure.

791
01:02:08,095 --> 01:02:09,763
I got the window, Chris.

792
01:02:09,863 --> 01:02:11,998
- Set security, boys.
- All right, let's get set up.

793
01:02:12,098 --> 01:02:13,767
Corner.

794
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:16,435
Let's move them into the other room.

795
01:02:19,101 --> 01:02:22,325
Y'all ask if he knows him.
You recognize this guy?

796
01:02:24,978 --> 01:02:26,297
He says he does not.

797
01:02:27,347 --> 01:02:29,405
How 'bout you, son?
You recognize this face?

798
01:02:31,151 --> 01:02:32,966
You sure?

799
01:02:34,387 --> 01:02:37,983
Well, you know, you make sure you tell 'em
they're not gonna go anywhere until we do.

800
01:02:41,661 --> 01:02:43,197
Hey, you keep eyes on that window.

801
01:02:43,297 --> 01:02:46,853
Make sure you take pictures
of anybody coming and going.

802
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:06,229
What do we got?

803
01:03:07,487 --> 01:03:11,225
- 16 military-aged males have gone in.
- 16?

804
01:03:11,325 --> 01:03:15,228
Yeah, they serve more customers
than a fucking McDonald's.

805
01:03:15,328 --> 01:03:17,710
Here, check this out.

806
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:23,804
Is he still in there?

807
01:03:23,904 --> 01:03:27,641
I clocked one point of entry. He's in there,
but it's not gonna be an easy breach.

808
01:03:27,741 --> 01:03:29,510
Oh, I don't know about that, man.

809
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:32,913
Probably see The Legend and just let him
right in, you know, big-time celebrity.

810
01:03:33,013 --> 01:03:37,419
Ask him to sign their burka.
Appear at their child's birthday parties.

811
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:39,954
Hey, what is your problem?
I didn't... I didn't promote myself.

812
01:03:40,054 --> 01:03:42,223
Yeah, no shit, motherfucker.
I did that for you.

813
01:03:42,323 --> 01:03:47,444
You woulda never made chief if I hadn't
nicknamed you the fucking myth or some shit.

814
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:57,004
He invites you to join him
for an Eid Al Adha supper.

815
01:03:57,104 --> 01:04:01,225
He says, "on this day,
everyone has a seat at my table."

816
01:04:01,475 --> 01:04:04,095
Oh, that's pretty generous of him.

817
01:04:12,486 --> 01:04:15,201
That was, like, close, man.

818
01:04:19,426 --> 01:04:23,397
Take a cucumber. Take cucumber
and put it in a tub with vinegar.

819
01:04:23,497 --> 01:04:24,431
Yeah.

820
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:28,902
Stick in cayenne pepper and a lemon...
and let it soak overnight.

821
01:04:29,002 --> 01:04:32,907
It's that, and just add vodka.
That's the idea. You wanna get in on it?

822
01:04:33,007 --> 01:04:35,844
Let's do it, dude.
I'm a ground-floor investor.

823
01:04:35,944 --> 01:04:38,883
Biggles, you never cooked
a day in your life.

824
01:04:40,815 --> 01:04:43,217
Dude, that was the real question.

825
01:04:43,317 --> 01:04:46,848
- That was super real.
- All these random people getting behind us.

826
01:04:48,957 --> 01:04:52,109
Oh, my God, I fell in behind the myth.

827
01:04:53,661 --> 01:04:55,580
Holy shit.

828
01:05:09,478 --> 01:05:14,300
- Come on, man. Get some brains.
- I gotta wash my hands.

829
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:34,448
Hey, hey, hey!

830
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:38,033
- Go check that out.
- Stay right here. Stay here.

831
01:06:38,133 --> 01:06:41,056
- Hey, what the fuck?!
- Biggles, help me out.

832
01:06:43,373 --> 01:06:45,725
See that, Muj?

833
01:06:46,075 --> 01:06:47,160
You see that?

834
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,076
- What the fuck's going on?
- Bring the terp in.

835
01:06:49,176 --> 01:06:51,294
Oh, shit.

836
01:06:53,216 --> 01:06:57,221
All right. Now you tell him
that he's gonna be sent off to detention

837
01:06:57,321 --> 01:07:00,056
and the Iraqi courts can decide
what to do with him.

838
01:07:00,156 --> 01:07:02,476
Or he can help us get inside
of that restaurant downstairs.

839
01:07:02,626 --> 01:07:05,379
You tell him. Say it's his choice.

840
01:07:36,838 --> 01:07:38,244
That's it.

841
01:07:39,563 --> 01:07:41,482
All clear.

842
01:07:42,265 --> 01:07:44,588
Good, good. Moving.

843
01:07:47,429 --> 01:07:48,760
Assault team set.

844
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:56,436
- We're in tight. Security set.
- Package is moving.

845
01:08:11,095 --> 01:08:12,750
15 meters out.

846
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,355
10 meters.

847
01:08:21,205 --> 01:08:22,301
5 meters.

848
01:08:31,382 --> 01:08:32,483
He's knocking.

849
01:08:37,355 --> 01:08:38,380
Hold.

850
01:08:39,957 --> 01:08:41,030
They're vetting him.

851
01:08:43,728 --> 01:08:45,213
Lights out, Muj.

852
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:47,522
Execute. Execute.

853
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,733
Frag out! Frag out!

854
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:09,507
- Biggles, anything coming out the back?
- <i>Negative. No movement.</i>

855
01:09:12,957 --> 01:09:14,848
Oh, shit.

856
01:09:20,298 --> 01:09:23,019
- "D," take him down.
- Got him.

857
01:09:24,969 --> 01:09:26,126
Get him down.

858
01:09:30,576 --> 01:09:31,643
Oh, shit!

859
01:09:31,743 --> 01:09:34,083
<i>We found a tunnel. Watch your back.
Keep your eyes open.</i>

860
01:09:36,151 --> 01:09:38,371
Contact! Contact!

861
01:09:42,587 --> 01:09:45,305
Contact! Drop back!

862
01:09:47,626 --> 01:09:50,881
White-side! RPG on the white-side!

863
01:10:42,915 --> 01:10:45,035
Butcher's on the move.

864
01:10:45,285 --> 01:10:48,400
Repeat, Butcher's on the move.
I'm in pursuit.

865
01:10:57,834 --> 01:11:01,351
Butcher's down. Move in your position.

866
01:11:23,104 --> 01:11:25,658
I mean, I offered him detention.
It was his choice.

867
01:11:25,758 --> 01:11:28,535
Picked the wrong side.
It's all there is to it. Fog of war.

868
01:11:31,464 --> 01:11:35,553
Yo, Chris! Fuck it, man.
Let's go. Shit's getting hairy.

869
01:11:35,653 --> 01:11:38,220
Sir, we have armed insurgents moving this way.
We need to make tracks.

870
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,504
Heck of a job there, chief.

871
01:12:24,152 --> 01:12:26,954
- You want another one, or are you good?
- Look. What is this?

872
01:12:27,054 --> 01:12:29,391
No. Well, you get what it gives you.
That's how this thing works.

873
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:31,526
You don't get that one,
if that's the one you want.

874
01:12:31,626 --> 01:12:33,211
I like that.

875
01:12:41,636 --> 01:12:43,371
That's good. That's strong.

876
01:12:43,471 --> 01:12:46,341
- Chris Kyle, come on. Your truck's ready.
- You can move that all you want.

877
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:49,043
Your truck's ready. Im... impossible.

878
01:12:49,143 --> 01:12:52,346
- Give me your credit card.
- Okay. Interesting.

879
01:12:52,446 --> 01:12:54,438
- I already gave it to ya, I think.
- Oh, right.

880
01:12:55,577 --> 01:12:58,734
What? Hey, just pick that up
off the floor.

881
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:01,739
Make sure you get all of them up.
Well, you got one back here.

882
01:13:01,989 --> 01:13:03,099
Excuse me, sir?

883
01:13:05,894 --> 01:13:08,513
- Are you chief Chris Kyle?
- Yes, sir.

884
01:13:09,477 --> 01:13:13,620
My name is Mads. We met in Fallujah.
You saved my life.

885
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:18,524
- I did?
- Yes, sir.

886
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:21,443
We were stuck in a house
until you came in with the 1st marines.

887
01:13:21,543 --> 01:13:24,064
You were the one that carried me out.

888
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:26,414
Oh, wow. Well, the marines
saved our ass plenty of times.

889
01:13:26,514 --> 01:13:28,951
- How are you? You all right? You holding up?
- Great. Yeah.

890
01:13:29,051 --> 01:13:34,021
I'm... I'm just grateful to be alive.
It hasn't been...

891
01:13:34,121 --> 01:13:36,366
- Colt.
- It hasn't been easy.

892
01:13:36,466 --> 01:13:38,643
Well, you know.

893
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:42,912
A lot of guys lost more than just a leg.

894
01:13:43,599 --> 01:13:45,061
Did you lose some friends?

895
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:47,553
Well, that, too.
But I'm talking 'bout the guys that lived.

896
01:13:47,703 --> 01:13:50,539
That made it back, but they're just not...
they're just not back, you know?

897
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:53,075
- They can't seem to get right.
- Yeah.

898
01:13:55,509 --> 01:13:58,980
Why don't you come down to the V.A.
sometime? The guys would love it.

899
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,032
They all know who The Legend is.

900
01:14:02,536 --> 01:14:05,769
- Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
- Hey, buddy.

901
01:14:06,788 --> 01:14:09,189
Can I tell you something?

902
01:14:09,289 --> 01:14:13,043
Your dad? He's a hero.

903
01:14:13,694 --> 01:14:18,234
That's right.
He saved my life, and he...

904
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:20,436
he helped me get back to my little girl.

905
01:14:20,536 --> 01:14:24,023
- So, thank you for lending him to us.
- Okay.

906
01:14:24,473 --> 01:14:27,192
I wouldn't be here without him.

907
01:14:32,982 --> 01:14:34,742
My family thanks you for your service.

908
01:14:37,086 --> 01:14:40,557
Okay, thank you. All right.
Take care of yourself.

909
01:14:40,657 --> 01:14:42,124
- It's great to see you again.
- All right.

910
01:14:42,224 --> 01:14:44,793
- Come down to the V.A. sometime.
- Okay. Yeah.

911
01:14:44,893 --> 01:14:46,290
Grab your little lizard up there.

912
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:50,788
Thank you.

913
01:14:50,888 --> 01:14:51,962
- You're welcome.
- Have a good day.

914
01:14:52,062 --> 01:14:54,538
- You have a good day.
- Okay.

915
01:14:54,638 --> 01:14:57,628
All right, let's go meet
your sister, bubba.

916
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:28,723
Hey. Some help here?
My daughter's crying.

917
01:15:32,575 --> 01:15:34,194
That's my daughter over there.
I think she's crying.

918
01:15:34,294 --> 01:15:37,165
Can you help tend to her, please?
Excuse me.

919
01:15:39,115 --> 01:15:41,918
Hey! Hey, where you going?

920
01:15:42,018 --> 01:15:43,671
Hey!

921
01:15:43,941 --> 01:15:46,776
Hey, will you tend
to my daughter, please?

922
01:15:47,924 --> 01:15:49,642
Hey!

923
01:15:52,762 --> 01:15:56,817
Hey! Tend to my daughter, please!
Right now!

924
01:15:58,382 --> 01:16:01,689
I'm making memories by myself.

925
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:05,159
I have no one to share them with.

926
01:16:06,643 --> 01:16:10,166
Yeah, well, we got
our whole lives for that.

927
01:16:12,316 --> 01:16:14,701
When does that start?

928
01:16:15,351 --> 01:16:18,205
Even when you're here, you're not here.

929
01:16:18,955 --> 01:16:22,506
I see you. I feel you.

930
01:16:23,059 --> 01:16:25,582
But you're not here.

931
01:16:42,044 --> 01:16:44,199
I hate the teams for it.

932
01:16:46,149 --> 01:16:47,535
I do.

933
01:16:48,185 --> 01:16:50,054
You're my husband.

934
01:16:50,154 --> 01:16:53,467
You're the father of my children,
but they're the ones that pull you back.

935
01:17:00,029 --> 01:17:03,355
Yeah, but, you see, they...
they can't wait, and we can.

936
01:17:08,405 --> 01:17:11,729
If you think this war
isn't changing you, you're wrong.

937
01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:18,376
You can only circle the flame so long.

938
01:17:28,826 --> 01:17:30,150
It's true.

939
01:17:47,846 --> 01:17:49,140
Cadillac 31 actual,

940
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:53,347
we're tailing the Butcher's courier
currently on Maryland street. Over.

941
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:55,837
Hey! Got the ring.

942
01:17:56,687 --> 01:17:57,988
From where? From here?

943
01:17:58,088 --> 01:18:00,407
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah.
It's so much cheaper here.

944
01:18:00,957 --> 01:18:04,063
Dude, you bought it from savages?
How do you know it's not a blood diamond?

945
01:18:04,163 --> 01:18:05,865
Oh, what the fuck do you care, man?

946
01:18:05,965 --> 01:18:08,468
You've spilled so much blood over here.
You're The Legend.

947
01:18:08,568 --> 01:18:10,385
Oh, that's not for a rock.

948
01:18:10,535 --> 01:18:12,687
What the fuck ever, man.

949
01:18:13,337 --> 01:18:14,741
That's just hypocritical.

950
01:18:14,841 --> 01:18:16,208
Hey, ease up on that.
No, don't get too close.

951
01:18:16,308 --> 01:18:19,094
- All right. Hey, I know.
- Did you tell her where you bought it from?

952
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,892
Fuck no. I'm gonna tell her
I got that shit from Zales.

953
01:18:24,249 --> 01:18:26,385
<i>Hey, you still with us, cookie?</i>

954
01:18:26,485 --> 01:18:30,238
Just a half block back, baby.
We are wet and ready, big giggles.

955
01:18:30,388 --> 01:18:32,357
You know, "D"...

956
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:35,727
I predict in 20 years,
we're gonna have a reunion...

957
01:18:35,827 --> 01:18:37,546
and you'll be married to a dude.

958
01:18:38,216 --> 01:18:40,867
As long as you cook and clean.

959
01:18:49,508 --> 01:18:52,169
- Now, there they are.
- Oh, shit.

960
01:18:53,112 --> 01:18:54,746
Mustafa's got his peepers out.

961
01:18:54,846 --> 01:18:58,271
This motherfucker
is Keyser fucking Soze, bro.

962
01:19:14,633 --> 01:19:17,570
Hey, next time you get a clear shot,
you try not to miss him, all right?

963
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,923
Well, I would've gotten him in the alleyway
if I didn't have to save your ass.

964
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,669
So you gonna be my best man?

965
01:19:50,769 --> 01:19:52,506
Oh, just me?
Or is it gonna be everybody else, too?

966
01:19:52,606 --> 01:19:54,455
There's only gonna be
one best man, dude.

967
01:20:01,581 --> 01:20:03,733
Vehicle 1 taking fire.

968
01:20:03,883 --> 01:20:05,923
- Come on, give me a shot.
- All right.

969
01:20:26,173 --> 01:20:28,095
Biggles, move.

970
01:20:33,448 --> 01:20:35,066
Clear.

971
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:37,277
One on me.

972
01:20:49,329 --> 01:20:50,398
<i>We got him.</i>

973
01:20:50,498 --> 01:20:53,167
<i>Vehicle is secure.</i>

974
01:20:53,267 --> 01:20:55,477
<i>Set security, Chris.</i>

975
01:20:55,870 --> 01:20:57,421
Nope.

976
01:20:57,671 --> 01:20:59,156
Rooftop secure.

977
01:21:00,347 --> 01:21:02,576
Aren't you worried that she's
gonna take that thing to Zales,

978
01:21:02,676 --> 01:21:05,148
find out how much you spent?

979
01:21:05,412 --> 01:21:07,915
- Well, no, I wasn't.
- Set security.

980
01:21:08,015 --> 01:21:10,517
- Now I'm a little worried about it.
- You should be.

981
01:21:10,617 --> 01:21:12,853
What do you mean,
she can trace the diamond to Zales?

982
01:21:12,953 --> 01:21:14,080
I don't think that's gonna...

983
01:21:17,325 --> 01:21:19,981
You okay, buddy? You're all right.

984
01:21:25,909 --> 01:21:30,458
Got a man down. Biggles is down.
Northwest corner, rooftop!

985
01:21:34,408 --> 01:21:35,518
Hang in there, bud.

986
01:21:40,413 --> 01:21:42,908
I need a corpsman right now!

987
01:21:53,295 --> 01:21:56,375
Okay, bubba. We're gonna pick you up
and take you downstairs.

988
01:21:59,267 --> 01:22:01,227
I can walk.

989
01:22:15,758 --> 01:22:17,748
Get him in the Humvee.
Get him in the Humvee.

990
01:22:17,848 --> 01:22:18,954
Breaking off.

991
01:22:19,054 --> 01:22:21,873
I got him. I got him.

992
01:22:25,038 --> 01:22:27,696
- Come on. Get in. Hang in there, Biggles.
- Fuck.

993
01:22:27,796 --> 01:22:29,697
Hang in there, Biggles.

994
01:22:29,797 --> 01:22:32,086
Hang in, Biggles.

995
01:22:34,636 --> 01:22:37,037
- It's okay.
- Shit, I'm sorry, man.

996
01:22:37,137 --> 01:22:40,642
For what? What are you sorry for?
It's my fault we went on that roof.

997
01:22:40,742 --> 01:22:42,244
Am I gonna die?

998
01:22:42,344 --> 01:22:46,181
Fuck no, Biggles. You're a fucking frogman.
Frogmen don't fucking die.

999
01:22:46,281 --> 01:22:49,584
Gonna put some sand in this fucking cut.
We'll get you a fucking canteen of water.

1000
01:22:49,684 --> 01:22:51,452
You're gonna be fucking fine, Biggles.
Hang in there.

1001
01:22:51,552 --> 01:22:54,442
Hey, Chris. You make sure
she gets that ring, all right?

1002
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:56,305
Sure will.

1003
01:23:00,529 --> 01:23:03,382
All right, let's decrease suction.
The retractor, please.

1004
01:23:03,832 --> 01:23:06,203
More blood.
How long before we get film on him?

1005
01:23:06,303 --> 01:23:09,771
We need another unit of blood.
Give me a 3 only.

1006
01:23:09,871 --> 01:23:11,907
- All right, saline... now.
- More suction.

1007
01:23:12,007 --> 01:23:14,743
- Hold your hands right here.
- Okay.

1008
01:23:14,843 --> 01:23:17,988
Type and cross.
I need those numbers now.

1009
01:23:26,866 --> 01:23:28,541
Did you see where it came from?

1010
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:32,094
Yeah, it was more than 1,000 meters out.

1011
01:23:32,194 --> 01:23:34,549
Only one enemy sniper
coulda made that shot.

1012
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:37,420
Will he make it?

1013
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,603
Took a round off
the feed tray cover. Was 48.

1014
01:23:40,703 --> 01:23:42,604
Doesn't look good.

1015
01:23:42,704 --> 01:23:44,842
That's the first SEAL hit, sir.

1016
01:23:44,942 --> 01:23:46,859
Fuck!

1017
01:23:47,609 --> 01:23:51,580
Shi'a cab driver we source is saying
there's a stronghold seven doors down.

1018
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,366
Marine units covered your exfil
are still engaged there.

1019
01:23:54,725 --> 01:23:59,538
I can understand if you want
to stand down and regroup. It's up to you.

1020
01:23:59,889 --> 01:24:02,295
Lex talionis.

1021
01:24:02,395 --> 01:24:04,533
Eye for an eye.

1022
01:24:09,264 --> 01:24:11,380
We're going back out.

1023
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,421
- Fucking "A."
- Fuck, yes.

1024
01:24:13,971 --> 01:24:15,757
Let's go.

1025
01:24:16,807 --> 01:24:18,425
It's on.

1026
01:24:47,972 --> 01:24:49,029
Hey!

1027
01:24:52,376 --> 01:24:54,666
2 klicks out.

1028
01:25:21,605 --> 01:25:23,538
Hallway clear.

1029
01:25:23,742 --> 01:25:26,496
On the left. Bumping.

1030
01:25:29,546 --> 01:25:31,521
Hallway.

1031
01:25:34,052 --> 01:25:37,120
Hallway clear. On the left.

1032
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:39,798
Clear.

1033
01:25:40,274 --> 01:25:42,143
All clear.

1034
01:25:45,964 --> 01:25:47,325
All clear.

1035
01:25:48,631 --> 01:25:51,619
Hey, Marc.
Looks like someone left in a hurry.

1036
01:25:59,075 --> 01:26:00,545
- Man down!
- Cover the window!

1037
01:26:00,645 --> 01:26:02,462
Man down!

1038
01:26:02,712 --> 01:26:05,208
- Cut that window!
- Cut that window!

1039
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:16,647
Come on, Marc.

1040
01:26:19,297 --> 01:26:23,553
Let's go, buddy. I got you, man. I got you.
Look at me. Look at me.

1041
01:26:25,103 --> 01:26:26,889
I got you.

1042
01:26:35,969 --> 01:26:37,267
Marc's gone, bro.

1043
01:26:39,717 --> 01:26:42,953
I got one SEAL down.
I need cabs back immediately.

1044
01:26:43,053 --> 01:26:45,173
We gotta fucking move him.

1045
01:26:53,586 --> 01:26:56,714
"Glory is something some men chase,

1046
01:26:56,814 --> 01:26:59,705
"and others find themselves
stumbling upon

1047
01:26:59,805 --> 01:27:02,440
"not expecting to find it.

1048
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:05,177
"Either way,
it is a noble gesture that one...

1049
01:27:05,327 --> 01:27:07,246
"finds bestowed upon them.

1050
01:27:07,346 --> 01:27:13,334
"My question is, when does glory fade away
and become a wrongful crusade?

1051
01:27:13,484 --> 01:27:17,963
"Or an unjustified means
by which consumes one...

1052
01:27:18,063 --> 01:27:20,895
"completely? I've...

1053
01:27:21,494 --> 01:27:24,162
"seen war...

1054
01:27:24,262 --> 01:27:28,134
"and I've seen... death."

1055
01:27:28,234 --> 01:27:30,586
Detail. Ten-hut!

1056
01:27:32,036 --> 01:27:34,622
Port arms!

1057
01:27:35,407 --> 01:27:37,142
Ready!

1058
01:27:37,242 --> 01:27:38,744
Aim.

1059
01:27:38,844 --> 01:27:40,580
Fire!

1060
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,547
Ready.

1061
01:27:42,647 --> 01:27:43,732
Aim.

1062
01:27:44,182 --> 01:27:45,619
Fire!

1063
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:47,418
Ready.

1064
01:27:47,518 --> 01:27:50,423
Aim. Fire!

1065
01:27:50,523 --> 01:27:53,483
Present arms!

1066
01:28:47,012 --> 01:28:50,001
Marc wrote that letter 2 weeks ago.

1067
01:28:52,151 --> 01:28:54,904
Did he say any of that to you?

1068
01:29:02,927 --> 01:29:06,083
Chris, I wanna know
what you thought of his letter.

1069
01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:12,455
An AQI informant had called in a tip, and...
Biggles had just been shot.

1070
01:29:12,555 --> 01:29:16,543
We were operating out of emotion,
and we just walked right into an ambush.

1071
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:19,862
But that's not what killed him.

1072
01:29:20,612 --> 01:29:22,882
That letter did.
That letter killed Marc.

1073
01:29:22,982 --> 01:29:27,633
He just... he let go,
and he paid the price for it.

1074
01:29:38,165 --> 01:29:40,461
Sign in here?

1075
01:29:50,811 --> 01:29:52,640
Hey, buddy.

1076
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:54,781
- Hey, Chris?
- Yeah.

1077
01:29:54,881 --> 01:29:56,633
- Where you at, man?
- I'm right here. I'm right here.

1078
01:29:56,983 --> 01:30:00,718
- Shit, you're blind as a bat.
- Yeah, it fucking blows.

1079
01:30:00,818 --> 01:30:04,326
- They say they're gonna fix my face, though.
- Oh, thank God.

1080
01:30:04,426 --> 01:30:07,995
- About time. Your face needs some fixing.
- It's too soon, man.

1081
01:30:08,095 --> 01:30:10,431
- It is too soon?
- Way too soon.

1082
01:30:10,531 --> 01:30:13,434
- Hey, I heard you proposed.
- Yeah.

1083
01:30:13,534 --> 01:30:17,171
Well, good for you. You didn't
tell her you bought that diamond...

1084
01:30:17,271 --> 01:30:19,483
- you told her you bought it at Zales, right?
- No.

1085
01:30:19,583 --> 01:30:23,010
- You didn't?
- No. No, got a new one.

1086
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:25,179
It's a smaller one.
Her dad helped me out with it.

1087
01:30:25,279 --> 01:30:26,347
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

1088
01:30:26,447 --> 01:30:28,383
Oh, good.

1089
01:30:28,483 --> 01:30:30,403
She wouldn't leave me, bro.

1090
01:30:32,653 --> 01:30:35,038
I told her to go,
and she wouldn't leave.

1091
01:30:35,991 --> 01:30:38,909
She's getting a raw fucking deal.

1092
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:43,704
Why would you say that?
Don't say that. She's got you.

1093
01:30:45,767 --> 01:30:49,526
- All 2 inches of you.
- 2 inches.

1094
01:30:50,438 --> 01:30:53,908
Yeah, you know, I'm glad
this happened to me and not you.

1095
01:30:54,008 --> 01:30:57,694
- Ain't no way you coulda handled it.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

1096
01:30:58,274 --> 01:31:01,617
So they say you're the deadliest sniper
in U.S. military history.

1097
01:31:01,717 --> 01:31:04,671
- Oh, is that right?
- That's what I heard.

1098
01:31:06,421 --> 01:31:09,858
- The bad guys ended up in Sadr City.
- You're not going back.

1099
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:11,826
Yeah, we are. We're gonna
wall 'em in and hunt 'em down.

1100
01:31:11,926 --> 01:31:13,527
Nah, come on, man.
You don't have to do that.

1101
01:31:13,627 --> 01:31:16,766
Oh, we have to do that.
You're my brother.

1102
01:31:16,866 --> 01:31:19,793
And they're gonna fucking pay
for what they did to you.

1103
01:31:21,535 --> 01:31:24,171
Hooyah, Legend.

1104
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:25,860
Fucking hooyah.

1105
01:31:31,746 --> 01:31:36,518
Something happens to me,
you'd be all right.

1106
01:31:36,618 --> 01:31:39,473
You'd find someone else.

1107
01:31:41,423 --> 01:31:43,892
Do you wanna die?

1108
01:31:43,992 --> 01:31:45,992
Is that what it is?

1109
01:31:46,092 --> 01:31:47,814
No.

1110
01:31:48,364 --> 01:31:50,215
Then just tell me.

1111
01:31:51,365 --> 01:31:52,802
Tell me why you do it.

1112
01:31:52,902 --> 01:31:54,437
- Oh, come on.
- I wanna understand.

1113
01:31:54,537 --> 01:31:56,906
Babe, I do it for you. You know that.
I do it to protect you.

1114
01:31:57,006 --> 01:31:59,274
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

1115
01:31:59,374 --> 01:32:00,906
I'm here.

1116
01:32:01,006 --> 01:32:03,661
Your family is here.
Your children have no father.

1117
01:32:03,761 --> 01:32:07,216
- Well, I have to serve my country.
- That is such fucking bullshit!

1118
01:32:07,316 --> 01:32:10,897
- No, it's not.
- You don't know when to quit.

1119
01:32:11,486 --> 01:32:15,291
You did your part. We've sacrificed enough.
You let somebody else go.

1120
01:32:15,391 --> 01:32:17,226
- Let somebody else go?
- Yeah.

1121
01:32:17,326 --> 01:32:20,595
- I couldn't live with myself.
- Yeah, well, you find a way.

1122
01:32:20,695 --> 01:32:22,018
You have to.

1123
01:32:27,168 --> 01:32:31,610
Okay, I need you to be human again.

1124
01:32:33,308 --> 01:32:34,728
I need you here.

1125
01:32:36,778 --> 01:32:39,724
Baby, I need you here.

1126
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:45,004
If you leave again...

1127
01:32:45,355 --> 01:32:48,265
I don't think we'll be here
when you get back.

1128
01:32:53,997 --> 01:32:55,406
Come here.

1129
01:33:14,450 --> 01:33:17,253
Chris. Oh, man.

1130
01:33:17,353 --> 01:33:20,190
We've been shot off position
three nights in a row, man.

1131
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:22,958
Fallujah was bad. Ramadi was worse.

1132
01:33:23,058 --> 01:33:26,395
- This shit is fucking biblical, Chris.
- Is there any other punishers here?

1133
01:33:26,495 --> 01:33:30,599
Squirrel cycled out. And Dauber was
coming back, but his wife knocked him up.

1134
01:33:30,699 --> 01:33:34,103
And if I bring home another rug, my wife'll
murder my motherfucking ass, Chris.

1135
01:33:34,203 --> 01:33:36,439
- Teams and shit, right?
- Teams and shit.

1136
01:33:36,539 --> 01:33:38,242
Man, that Biggles news hit hard, man.

1137
01:33:38,342 --> 01:33:42,674
I went to see him in the hospital
before I left. Motherfucker can't see shit.

1138
01:33:43,013 --> 01:33:44,668
Biggles is gone, Chris.

1139
01:33:45,969 --> 01:33:49,540
He was in surgery yesterday, and...
he died on that table.

1140
01:33:57,826 --> 01:34:01,431
<i>Hey, this is Taya. I can't get to the phone,
so please leave a message.</i>

1141
01:34:01,531 --> 01:34:04,969
<i>It's me... Just calling
to hear your voice.</i>

1142
01:34:05,069 --> 01:34:09,656
<i>I'm missing you guys. Been thinking
about some things you said.</i>

1143
01:34:10,106 --> 01:34:13,837
<i>Tell the kids I love 'em.
I love you, too.</i>

1144
01:35:21,346 --> 01:35:22,856
Don't pick it up.

1145
01:35:26,785 --> 01:35:28,772
Don't you fucking pick it up.

1146
01:35:34,158 --> 01:35:35,982
Son of a bitch.

1147
01:35:39,732 --> 01:35:41,419
Fucking drop it.

1148
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:56,100
Drop it, you little cocksucker.

1149
01:36:25,376 --> 01:36:28,937
All right, listen up. The head-shed believe
this T-wall here will help win the war

1150
01:36:29,037 --> 01:36:31,485
by trapping remaining AQI behind it.

1151
01:36:31,585 --> 01:36:33,701
Problem is the engineers building
the goddamn things

1152
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:36,855
are getting picked off by one single sniper
from deep behind the wall.

1153
01:36:36,955 --> 01:36:38,664
How deep?

1154
01:36:38,764 --> 01:36:41,100
- Roughly 1,000 meters.
- Is it Mustafa?

1155
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:42,696
- Mu-who?
- I don't know, dude.

1156
01:36:42,796 --> 01:36:44,797
The sniper who killed
our fucking friend Biggles, man.

1157
01:36:44,897 --> 01:36:48,258
He can be whoever the fuck you need him
to be. We just need him dead.

1158
01:36:48,358 --> 01:36:50,702
We'll shuttle you 6 blocks north
into enemy territory,

1159
01:36:50,802 --> 01:36:53,607
which will put you right up under the sniper's
nose when he takes his shot, okay?

1160
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:57,143
- In the middle of a fucking sandstorm?
- Bring your fucking goggles, Bambi.

1161
01:36:57,243 --> 01:37:01,714
We need to shut this shooter down.
Understood? Gear up.

1162
01:37:01,814 --> 01:37:04,899
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1163
01:38:26,933 --> 01:38:28,827
It's clear. Move out.

1164
01:39:09,978 --> 01:39:11,046
Clear.

1165
01:39:11,146 --> 01:39:12,695
- We're maneuver. You're base.
- Yep.

1166
01:39:12,795 --> 01:39:14,499
Go.

1167
01:39:14,849 --> 01:39:16,169
Go!

1168
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:23,625
- Clear.
- Moving.

1169
01:39:23,725 --> 01:39:25,436
Go! Go!

1170
01:39:27,427 --> 01:39:28,930
All clear.

1171
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:31,113
Set security.

1172
01:40:09,805 --> 01:40:12,270
The streets are crawling.
Hold your fire.

1173
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:25,163
Enter the fucking sandman.

1174
01:41:04,527 --> 01:41:06,149
- Man down!
- Man back!

1175
01:41:09,599 --> 01:41:11,056
Shit!

1176
01:41:11,156 --> 01:41:13,965
Shot came from the east!

1177
01:41:19,141 --> 01:41:22,123
We set up
in the wrong fucking direction.

1178
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:26,739
Doesn't matter. Hold your fire.
We got uglies right below us.

1179
01:41:59,949 --> 01:42:02,668
I got something 1,900 yards out.

1180
01:42:02,918 --> 01:42:06,940
Fuck, you can't even see that far out.
Hold your fire. You'll expose us all.

1181
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,325
He's right, Legend. <i>No bueno.</i>

1182
01:42:09,425 --> 01:42:12,746
Correction. It's 2,100 yards out.

1183
01:42:13,896 --> 01:42:16,386
That's more than a mile.
Impossible shot, Chris.

1184
01:42:28,856 --> 01:42:29,998
It's him.

1185
01:42:32,048 --> 01:42:36,053
This is task unit bruiser.
I got eyes on target. Initiate QRF. Over.

1186
01:42:36,153 --> 01:42:39,855
Copy that. ET on quick reaction force
is 20 minutes out.

1187
01:42:55,005 --> 01:42:58,419
- He has eyes on our guys.
- Can you confirm it's him?

1188
01:43:01,044 --> 01:43:03,129
It's him.

1189
01:43:03,479 --> 01:43:06,267
- Oh, it's him.
- It's your call, Chris.

1190
01:43:06,817 --> 01:43:10,057
Quick reaction force is 20 minutes out.
You'll stand the fuck down!

1191
01:43:23,501 --> 01:43:25,020
If you got it, take it, man.

1192
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:30,758
Aim small, miss small.

1193
01:43:31,108 --> 01:43:32,860
Do it for Biggles.

1194
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,456
You just fucked us, Legend.

1195
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:12,685
Tango down.

1196
01:44:12,785 --> 01:44:14,653
We need QRF asap!

1197
01:44:19,224 --> 01:44:21,009
Mission accomplished.

1198
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:23,311
He had eyes on our guys.

1199
01:44:23,461 --> 01:44:28,199
- <i>And I took him out.</i>
- Yeah. Now we're fucked like a football bat.

1200
01:44:30,468 --> 01:44:32,022
Biggles would be proud.

1201
01:44:34,359 --> 01:44:35,826
You did it, Chris.

1202
01:44:38,476 --> 01:44:42,047
Echo 7 kilo, be advised you have enemy
approaching all directions of your pos.

1203
01:44:42,147 --> 01:44:45,017
White-side! Goddamn it, Legend. Fuck!

1204
01:44:45,117 --> 01:44:47,271
Yeah, let's go. Come on.

1205
01:44:53,364 --> 01:44:56,794
All right, I see 2 ways up onto the roof.
We wanna lock both staircases.

1206
01:44:56,894 --> 01:44:58,217
<i>Conserve ammo.</i>

1207
01:45:29,062 --> 01:45:31,339
Get some, motherfuckers.

1208
01:45:57,689 --> 01:46:01,074
Echo 7 kilo, you have tango-heavy gun
on your green-side.

1209
01:46:42,569 --> 01:46:47,443
<i>We're taking effective fire, white-side!
Effective fire, white-side!</i>

1210
01:46:56,181 --> 01:47:00,372
- "D", I'm down to 2 mags! We gotta move!
- Don't stop fucking shooting, man!

1211
01:47:02,162 --> 01:47:04,278
QRF's stuck three blocks out.

1212
01:47:15,436 --> 01:47:18,355
- <i>I'm out!</i>
- 3 o'clock. Loading last mag.

1213
01:47:18,905 --> 01:47:20,841
<i>I've only got one mag left!</i>

1214
01:47:20,941 --> 01:47:23,677
<i>I'm black! I'm black!
Anybody got a mag?!</i>

1215
01:47:23,777 --> 01:47:26,412
<i>We can't hold 'em any longer!
We gotta move!</i>

1216
01:47:26,512 --> 01:47:27,998
Those guys are sitting ducks.

1217
01:47:28,148 --> 01:47:32,137
- I don't wanna get dragged in the street.
- That's it. Do it.

1218
01:47:32,587 --> 01:47:33,722
Call it in.

1219
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:36,023
This is Rio 2 Bravo
requesting ordnance drop.

1220
01:47:36,123 --> 01:47:41,029
- Grid number 04837959.
- <i>That target location is your position.</i>

1221
01:47:41,129 --> 01:47:43,899
I know my fucking position!
They're right on top of us. Just drop it!

1222
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:46,417
Viper 34, move to final attack heading.

1223
01:47:46,995 --> 01:47:50,509
Viper 34. Roger. 30 seconds out.

1224
01:48:01,381 --> 01:48:03,135
<i>Hello?</i>

1225
01:48:04,585 --> 01:48:05,954
Baby?

1226
01:48:06,054 --> 01:48:10,782
<i>Chris? Baby, I ca...
baby, I can't hear you. Hello?</i>

1227
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:13,378
I'm ready.

1228
01:48:13,928 --> 01:48:17,350
- I'm ready to come home.
- <i>What?</i>

1229
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:22,186
I have the building in sight.

1230
01:48:24,058 --> 01:48:26,123
<i>What's happening?</i>

1231
01:48:28,126 --> 01:48:30,095
I'm ready to come home, baby.

1232
01:48:31,002 --> 01:48:32,265
Chris?

1233
01:48:35,315 --> 01:48:38,386
It's pretty bad air up here.
I can't hold this much longer.

1234
01:48:38,486 --> 01:48:40,105
Tell the pilot "turn it loose."

1235
01:48:40,255 --> 01:48:42,770
<i>Viper 34. Fire away.</i>

1236
01:48:47,396 --> 01:48:48,380
<i>Target missed.</i>

1237
01:48:51,733 --> 01:48:53,626
Shit.

1238
01:48:54,535 --> 01:48:58,355
We need to exfil now!
Let's go! Let's move!

1239
01:49:02,945 --> 01:49:04,870
We gotta move!

1240
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:15,842
<i>Echo 7 kilo,
green-side is clear for exit.</i>

1241
01:49:19,426 --> 01:49:22,383
I got the out. Green-side pole on my go!

1242
01:49:24,933 --> 01:49:27,036
They're on the roof.

1243
01:49:27,335 --> 01:49:28,463
Let's go!

1244
01:49:47,156 --> 01:49:48,511
Last man!

1245
01:50:07,777 --> 01:50:09,341
Get to the back!

1246
01:50:21,191 --> 01:50:22,725
Go! Go! Go!

1247
01:50:22,825 --> 01:50:24,360
Come on! Inside, inside!

1248
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:27,011
Get in the truck!
Get in the truck now! We got to go!

1249
01:50:40,075 --> 01:50:42,245
Come on! We got to get out now!

1250
01:50:42,345 --> 01:50:44,097
Let me up.

1251
01:50:44,247 --> 01:50:46,800
Come on, let me up. Come on.

1252
01:50:48,950 --> 01:50:50,387
Where's Chris?

1253
01:50:50,487 --> 01:50:52,726
He was just behind me.
Where is Chris, man?

1254
01:50:55,124 --> 01:50:56,476
Open the fucking door.

1255
01:51:01,231 --> 01:51:02,463
Stop the goddamn rig!

1256
01:51:06,001 --> 01:51:07,537
Where is he?! Chris!

1257
01:51:07,637 --> 01:51:08,949
Chris, come on!

1258
01:51:09,572 --> 01:51:12,444
- Come on!
- Hold the fucking vehicle, man!

1259
01:51:12,544 --> 01:51:16,296
We can't leave you! Come on, Chris!
Grab my hand! Come on, Chris!

1260
01:51:17,046 --> 01:51:18,398
Pull him in now!

1261
01:51:22,959 --> 01:51:24,972
Come on, Chris!

1262
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:37,596
- Yeah?
- <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

1263
01:52:37,696 --> 01:52:41,583
I just... I got this weird message
that you were on a plane or something?

1264
01:52:41,933 --> 01:52:44,435
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I got out early.</i>

1265
01:52:44,535 --> 01:52:46,605
You did?

1266
01:52:46,705 --> 01:52:48,807
So, what, are you in Germany,
or... where?

1267
01:52:48,907 --> 01:52:51,512
No, I'm here. I'm...

1268
01:52:53,344 --> 01:52:54,862
I'm stateside.

1269
01:52:55,812 --> 01:52:57,766
You're home?

1270
01:52:58,416 --> 01:53:00,969
What... what are you doing?

1271
01:53:04,989 --> 01:53:07,843
I guess I just needed a minute.

1272
01:53:09,793 --> 01:53:15,426
Chris, the... the kids are dying
to see you. It's been 9 months.

1273
01:53:22,907 --> 01:53:25,343
I'm coming home.

1274
01:53:25,443 --> 01:53:27,661
<i>Are you all right?</i>

1275
01:53:27,911 --> 01:53:30,006
Yeah, I'm good.

1276
01:53:33,053 --> 01:53:35,831
Babe, come home. Okay?

1277
01:53:35,931 --> 01:53:38,722
You know, we... we miss you.

1278
01:53:41,694 --> 01:53:43,820
Okay.

1279
01:54:23,875 --> 01:54:25,055
Hey, Chris?

1280
01:54:25,705 --> 01:54:27,605
Babe.

1281
01:54:34,379 --> 01:54:37,102
Hon, I'm... I'm going outside.

1282
01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:46,676
- Get it.
- Higher.

1283
01:54:47,326 --> 01:54:50,974
Look at you. I can see
your face again, babe. Looks good.

1284
01:54:51,225 --> 01:54:53,717
- Oh, good.
- Looks different.

1285
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:57,017
So the game's this Saturday.

1286
01:54:57,117 --> 01:55:01,007
You know, he's the tallest kid on the team.
Doctor said he could be 6'4".

1287
01:55:01,107 --> 01:55:03,092
Isn't that insane?

1288
01:55:03,937 --> 01:55:05,848
I can't wait for you to see him play.
I go so crazy, though,

1289
01:55:05,948 --> 01:55:08,381
when the other kids jump on him.
Like, I need you there as, like, a leveler,

1290
01:55:08,481 --> 01:55:10,478
you know what I mean?

1291
01:55:11,018 --> 01:55:13,969
Hey, maybe you could
even coach, you know?

1292
01:55:16,489 --> 01:55:19,092
'Kenna's gonna lose that tooth,
and I'm so worried she's gonna swallow it,

1293
01:55:19,192 --> 01:55:23,530
like, in her sleep or something. And she said
she'd let you pull it, but only you.

1294
01:55:23,630 --> 01:55:25,449
Would you do that?

1295
01:55:42,882 --> 01:55:44,292
Chris!

1296
01:55:58,966 --> 01:56:02,253
I got a very interesting phone call.
It's from your wife.

1297
01:56:02,603 --> 01:56:04,621
She told me about the barbecue.

1298
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:08,008
Yeah, that was unfortunate. Yeah.

1299
01:56:08,108 --> 01:56:10,145
Things seem like
they got a little out of hand.

1300
01:56:10,245 --> 01:56:12,980
- Are you worried?
- No, sir.

1301
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:16,468
So you're not worried about what happened,
or what might happen?

1302
01:56:16,618 --> 01:56:18,644
No, sir, I'm not worried about that.

1303
01:56:20,287 --> 01:56:22,590
Let me ask you a question, Chris.

1304
01:56:22,690 --> 01:56:25,529
How much time did you spend in-country?

1305
01:56:25,629 --> 01:56:29,864
- Well, 4 tours, so...
- That's like, what, 1,000 days?

1306
01:56:29,964 --> 01:56:32,116
Yeah, sounds about right.

1307
01:56:32,466 --> 01:56:34,058
Would you be surprised if I told you

1308
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:39,276
that the Navy has credited you
with over 160 kills?

1309
01:56:40,373 --> 01:56:42,487
Do you ever think that...

1310
01:56:42,587 --> 01:56:47,063
you might have seen things or done some
things over there that you wish you hadn't?

1311
01:56:47,313 --> 01:56:49,666
Oh, that's not me. No.

1312
01:56:50,316 --> 01:56:52,719
- What's not you?
- I was just protecting my guys.

1313
01:56:52,819 --> 01:56:55,536
They were trying to kill
our soldiers, and...

1314
01:56:55,636 --> 01:56:59,802
I'm willing to meet my creator
and answer for every shot that I took.

1315
01:57:02,396 --> 01:57:04,752
The thing that...

1316
01:57:05,099 --> 01:57:08,320
haunts me are all the guys
that I couldn't save.

1317
01:57:09,670 --> 01:57:14,348
You know, I'm willing and able to be there,
but I'm not. I'm here. I quit.

1318
01:57:16,143 --> 01:57:18,146
So you wish
you could've saved more guys?

1319
01:57:19,581 --> 01:57:20,967
Yes, sir.

1320
01:57:22,617 --> 01:57:26,154
You know, you can walk down
any hall in this hospital.

1321
01:57:26,254 --> 01:57:28,610
We got plenty of soldiers need saving.

1322
01:57:34,229 --> 01:57:36,098
Wanna take a walk?

1323
01:57:36,198 --> 01:57:37,910
Sure.

1324
01:57:38,199 --> 01:57:41,541
All right. I wanna show you something.

1325
01:57:44,439 --> 01:57:45,661
I still smoke.

1326
01:57:45,761 --> 01:57:49,678
Can't be too mad at it
'cause it kinda saved my right hand.

1327
01:57:49,778 --> 01:57:51,412
How so?

1328
01:57:51,512 --> 01:57:55,650
When I got blown up, I had both of my hands
on the bottom of the steering wheel.

1329
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:59,021
And right before the explosion went off,
I took my hand off,

1330
01:57:59,121 --> 01:58:01,450
grabbed a cigarette,
stuck it in my mouth.

1331
01:58:01,550 --> 01:58:04,830
And when I went to go light it,
the explosion happened.

1332
01:58:04,930 --> 01:58:08,830
And it took the whole bottom of the steering
wheel and my left hand off.

1333
01:58:08,930 --> 01:58:13,953
And I was lucky that I had this. I mean,
it still fucked up my right hand, but...

1334
01:58:14,053 --> 01:58:15,471
- Yeah.
- ...I still got it.

1335
01:58:15,571 --> 01:58:18,824
- And you still smoke?
- Yeah, I still smoke.

1336
01:58:25,747 --> 01:58:30,203
Miss. Three inches to the right.
Come on, Wynn. You can do better than that.

1337
01:58:31,353 --> 01:58:33,807
Bring this to the right.

1338
01:58:33,957 --> 01:58:37,492
Make sure you keep both eyes open.
Let that trigger surprise you.

1339
01:58:37,592 --> 01:58:40,028
We're not shooting bad guys.
We're shooting paper.

1340
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:42,130
How about The Legend
stops trying to fuck up my shot?

1341
01:58:42,230 --> 01:58:43,648
- How about that?
- How about you hit one?

1342
01:58:45,735 --> 01:58:46,741
- Hit!
- There you go.

1343
01:58:46,841 --> 01:58:52,424
Bull's eye, boy. Damn, if that
don't feel like I got my balls back.

1344
01:58:53,374 --> 01:58:55,844
Why you spending
all this time with us, man?

1345
01:58:55,944 --> 01:58:57,613
I know you got a family.

1346
01:58:57,713 --> 01:59:00,316
I heard you had a boot collection
before the war?

1347
01:59:00,416 --> 01:59:02,625
So I was thinking,
I saw we were about the same size.

1348
01:59:03,352 --> 01:59:06,658
Seriously, man. Why do you do it?

1349
01:59:06,758 --> 01:59:09,357
Well, we take care of each other, right?

1350
01:59:09,457 --> 01:59:12,144
Let's see if you can't hit 2 in a row.

1351
01:59:13,163 --> 01:59:15,030
Come on, man. You got this.

1352
01:59:16,566 --> 01:59:18,221
- Hit!
- Nice.

1353
01:59:23,071 --> 01:59:25,615
- Hit!
- Goddamn.

1354
01:59:26,442 --> 01:59:27,861
Who's the legend now?

1355
01:59:29,477 --> 01:59:33,031
That's a title you don't want. Trust me.

1356
01:59:37,936 --> 01:59:39,834
Yo, will you hop down?
I'll give 'em to you.

1357
01:59:43,426 --> 01:59:45,980
- You add one more?
- Yeah.

1358
01:59:46,630 --> 01:59:49,305
- All right, take 'em inside.
- All right.

1359
02:00:11,755 --> 02:00:13,403
Come here.

1360
02:00:16,827 --> 02:00:18,928
It's not a bad life out here, is it?

1361
02:00:19,028 --> 02:00:21,331
Got a smile on his face.

1362
02:00:21,431 --> 02:00:23,850
Looks cheery to me.

1363
02:00:24,067 --> 02:00:26,520
Just doing his thing.

1364
02:00:28,505 --> 02:00:30,858
Wave goodbye to him.

1365
02:00:39,749 --> 02:00:42,118
Oh! Fuck, who is that?!

1366
02:00:42,218 --> 02:00:44,889
- Oh! Babe, is that you?
- Yep-A-Doo-Dee!

1367
02:00:44,989 --> 02:00:47,452
- Baby, I fucking hurt myself. Shit.
- What?

1368
02:00:47,552 --> 02:00:51,095
No, I'm all right. I'm all right!
I'm all right. Fuck.

1369
02:00:51,195 --> 02:00:52,597
- Baby, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1370
02:00:52,697 --> 02:00:55,280
What happened? Don't...

1371
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:01,123
You know that it's a heck of a thing
to stop a beating heart.

1372
02:01:01,473 --> 02:01:02,719
Yeah.

1373
02:01:02,819 --> 02:01:06,009
That's why we're gonna do it together
for your first time.

1374
02:01:06,109 --> 02:01:07,894
All right.

1375
02:01:08,244 --> 02:01:10,615
Now, remember, you gotta be calm...

1376
02:01:10,715 --> 02:01:12,651
confident...

1377
02:01:12,751 --> 02:01:15,111
and you never hesitate.

1378
02:01:16,353 --> 02:01:18,489
- All right.
- You got it, bubba?

1379
02:01:18,589 --> 02:01:20,159
- I got it.
- You feel good?

1380
02:01:20,259 --> 02:01:22,313
Yeah.

1381
02:01:37,542 --> 02:01:39,394
Hands in the air, little lady.

1382
02:01:40,004 --> 02:01:41,929
Hands in the air.

1383
02:01:42,779 --> 02:01:44,665
Now, you drop them drawers.

1384
02:01:46,317 --> 02:01:49,536
But you drop 'em nice and easy.

1385
02:01:50,559 --> 02:01:52,624
Oh, baby, look at you.

1386
02:01:52,724 --> 02:01:55,509
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

1387
02:01:55,959 --> 02:01:57,688
Can I tell you something?

1388
02:01:57,788 --> 02:02:00,699
- Tell it to the judge.
- Stop it.

1389
02:02:00,799 --> 02:02:04,034
No. I am so proud of you,
and I don't tell you enough.

1390
02:02:04,134 --> 02:02:06,939
I'm so proud of you.
And you're such a great father.

1391
02:02:07,039 --> 02:02:10,526
And I am so happy
that I've got my husband back.

1392
02:02:11,576 --> 02:02:14,392
And I also know how hard
you fought to get here.

1393
02:02:15,714 --> 02:02:18,397
You're worth fighting for.

1394
02:02:19,585 --> 02:02:23,072
Now tell me one other thing.
Did you... did you pleat those jeans?

1395
02:02:23,222 --> 02:02:25,557
Yes, ma'am. I believe
they're right down the middle.

1396
02:02:25,657 --> 02:02:27,760
Oh, you're just a regular
old cowboy again.

1397
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:30,462
That's right. Now, why don't you...
why don't you really drop them drawers?

1398
02:02:30,562 --> 02:02:33,332
I'm not wearing any drawers, baby.

1399
02:02:33,432 --> 02:02:35,716
I got 4 minutes.

1400
02:02:36,206 --> 02:02:37,353
Is that all it takes?

1401
02:02:37,453 --> 02:02:41,856
No, it takes 2 minutes. But then again
I want 2 minutes to look at you.

1402
02:02:42,309 --> 02:02:45,010
Aren't you going to the range?

1403
02:02:45,110 --> 02:02:46,879
Who are you taking out?

1404
02:02:46,979 --> 02:02:49,781
This marine. His Moma kept asking me.

1405
02:02:49,881 --> 02:02:53,017
She parks cars at the elementary school,
and she said, "can you help out my son?"

1406
02:02:53,117 --> 02:02:56,354
And I just thought... today's the only day
I can really do it, so...

1407
02:02:56,454 --> 02:02:58,790
It's gonna be just a little bit
of the afternoon. I'll be back.

1408
02:02:58,890 --> 02:03:00,632
Yes!

1409
02:03:01,459 --> 02:03:02,761
- You make sure you keep them drawers...
- Daddy.

1410
02:03:02,861 --> 02:03:05,263
- What's up? What's up?
- Dad, you wanna play Skylanders?

1411
02:03:05,363 --> 02:03:08,301
No, I can't play right now.
I'll do it when I get back, boy.

1412
02:03:08,401 --> 02:03:10,370
But, see, you're on level 8,
and that doesn't work.

1413
02:03:10,470 --> 02:03:13,772
I gotta be on level 4. And I don't want...
I wanna win. You gotta let me win.

1414
02:03:13,872 --> 02:03:14,873
No way!

1415
02:03:14,973 --> 02:03:16,909
- Poke the bear!
- Poke the what?

1416
02:03:17,009 --> 02:03:18,790
- Poke the bear!
- Poke the what?!

1417
02:03:19,110 --> 02:03:20,804
Poke the bear!

1418
02:03:21,214 --> 02:03:23,504
No! You're supposed to roar, like...

1419
02:03:23,884 --> 02:03:27,334
Like what? Like a beast, right?
Like what?

1420
02:03:33,227 --> 02:03:36,349
All right, bubba.
Y'all look after our women, okay?

1421
02:03:36,449 --> 02:03:38,965
- Yeah.
- Okay. It's a big responsibility.

1422
02:03:39,065 --> 02:03:40,917
You up for it?

1423
02:03:41,935 --> 02:03:43,437
All right. See you later, baby.

1424
02:03:43,537 --> 02:03:46,160
- I love you.
- I love you back.

1425
02:03:52,110 --> 02:03:53,858
- How are you? You good?
- Good.

1426
02:03:53,958 --> 02:03:56,582
We're gonna go about a 2-hour drive
and shoot some guns

1427
02:03:56,682 --> 02:03:58,662
and maybe have a little conversation
along the way. What you say?

1428
02:03:58,762 --> 02:04:00,871
- Yeah.
- All right. Let's go.

1429
02:04:01,721 --> 02:04:02,704
- Thank you.
- Yep.

1430
02:04:03,533 --> 02:04:07,116
Hey, you eat yet? You hungry?
You wanna get something on the way?
