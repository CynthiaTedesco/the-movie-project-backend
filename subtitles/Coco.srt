1
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,789
Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.

2
00:01:11,904 --> 00:01:14,756
'Cause of something that happened
before I was even born.

3
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:18,837
See, a long time ago,
there was this family.

4
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,794
The Papá, he was a musician.

5
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,184
He and his family
would sing and dance

6
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:26,537
and count their blessings.

7
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,765
But he also had a dream.

8
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:30,964
To play for the world.

9
00:01:33,364 --> 00:01:34,930
And one day...

10
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,474
he left with his guitar...

11
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:40,201
and never returned.

12
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:48,765
And my Mamá...

13
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,925
She didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.

14
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:56,898
After banishing all music
from her life...

15
00:01:57,858 --> 00:02:00,067
she found a way
to provide for her daughter.

16
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,655
She rolled up her sleeves...

17
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:07,614
and she learned to make shoes.

18
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:13,941
She could have made candy.

19
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:15,717
O-o-or fireworks.

20
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:18,484
Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers.

21
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:20,998
But no.

22
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:22,487
She chose shoes.

23
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:26,999
Then she taught
her daughter to make shoes.

24
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:30,734
And later, she taught
her son-in-law.

25
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:33,971
Then her grandkids got roped in.

26
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:38,081
As her family grew,
so did the business.

27
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,074
Music have torn
her family apart.

28
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:45,176
But shoes held
them all together.

29
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,613
You see that woman...

30
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:50,121
was my great-great-grandmother...

31
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,254
Mamá Imelda.

32
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:54,499
She died way before I was born.

33
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:56,968
But my family still
tells her story...

34
00:02:56,996 --> 00:03:00,760
every year on Día de los Muertos
-- the Day of the Dead...

35
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:05,704
And her little girl?
She's my great-grandmother, Mamá Coco.

36
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,001
Hola, Mamá Coco.

37
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:10,015
How are you, Julio?

38
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,119
Actually, my name is Miguel.

39
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:15,690
Mamá Coco has trouble
remembering things.

40
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:17,745
But it's good to talk to her,
anyway.

41
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:19,684
So, I tell her
pretty much everything.

42
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:21,278
I used to run like this.

43
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:23,824
But now I run like this,
it's just way faster.

44
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:26,780
The winner is...
luchadora Coco!

45
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:30,400
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.

46
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,570
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.

47
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,327
Miguel, eat your food.

48
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:36,631
My abuelita, she's
Mamá Coco's daughter.

49
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:39,608
Aw, you're a twig, mijo.
Have some more.

50
00:03:39,627 --> 00:03:40,674
No, gracias.

51
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:43,151
I asked if you would like
more tamales.

52
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:44,745
S-Si?

53
00:03:44,764 --> 00:03:46,838
That's what I thought you said!

54
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:50,891
Abuelita runs the house
just as Mamá Imelda did.

55
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,202
No music!

56
00:03:56,564 --> 00:03:57,986
No music!

57
00:03:58,015 --> 00:03:59,042
♪ Aunque la vida... ♪

58
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:00,867
No music!

59
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:04,342
I think we're the only family
in Mexico who hates music.

60
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:06,311
And my family's fine with that.

61
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:07,222
But me...

62
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:08,471
Be back by lunch, mijo.

63
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,623
Love you, Mamá!

64
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,964
I'm not like the rest
of my family.

65
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:15,912
- Hola, Miguel.
- Hola.

66
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:23,506
- Muchas gracias!
- De nada, Miguel!

67
00:04:27,262 --> 00:04:29,019
He-hey, Dante!

68
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:31,438
Sit.

69
00:04:31,476 --> 00:04:32,398
Down.

70
00:04:32,427 --> 00:04:33,475
Roll over.

71
00:04:33,503 --> 00:04:34,434
Shake.

72
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:35,931
Fist bump.

73
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:38,198
Good boy, Dante!

74
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,478
I know, I'm not supposed
to love music.

75
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:46,388
But it's not my fault.

76
00:04:46,532 --> 00:04:48,002
It's his.

77
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:49,999
Ernesto de la Cruz.

78
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:52,773
The greatest musician
of all time.

79
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:56,565
Here in this very plaza,
the young Ernesto de la Cruz

80
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:58,890
took his first steps
toward becoming

81
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:02,001
the most beloved singer
in Mexican history.

82
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:06,216
He started out a total nobody
from Santa Cecilia, like me.

83
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:08,645
But when he played music,

84
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:11,190
he made people
fall in love with him.

85
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:13,619
He starred in movies.

86
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:16,000
He had the coolest guitar.

87
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:17,699
He could fly!

88
00:05:17,977 --> 00:05:20,446
And he wrote the best songs.

89
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:22,491
But my all-time favorite is...

90
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:25,295
♪ Remember me ♪

91
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,213
♪ Though I have to say goodbye ♪

92
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:29,385
♪ Remember me ♪

93
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,123
♪ Don't let it make you cry ♪

94
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:32,880
♪ For even if I'm far away ♪

95
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,598
♪ I hold you in my heart ♪

96
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:36,519
♪ I sing a secret song to you ♪

97
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:38,257
♪ Each night we are apart ♪

98
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:39,332
 ♪ Remember me ♪

99
00:05:39,332 --> 00:05:41,012
♪ Though I have to travel far ♪

100
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:42,808
♪ Remember me ♪

101
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,940
♪ Each time you hear a sad guitar ♪

102
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:49,021
♪ Know that I'm with you the only way that I can be... ♪

103
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:53,581
♪ Until you're in my arms again ♪

104
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:55,501
He lived the kind of life you dream about...

105
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,717
♪ Remember me ♪

106
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:01,330
Until 1942.

107
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:06,361
When he was crushed
by a giant bell.

108
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:09,261
I wanna be just like him.

109
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:17,163
Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz...

110
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:19,257
and I get this feeling.

111
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:21,206
Like we're connected somehow.

112
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:23,164
Like if he could play music...

113
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:25,872
maybe someday, I could too!

114
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:29,021
If it wasn't for my family.

115
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,856
Ay, ay, ay, muchacho!

116
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:31,797
Huh?

117
00:06:31,816 --> 00:06:33,726
I asked for a shoe shine,
not your life story.

118
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:35,205
Oh, yeah, sorry.

119
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:38,430
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home, so.

120
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,881
Look, if I were you,

121
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,801
I'd march right up
to my family and say,

122
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:44,182
"Hey, I'm a musician.
Deal with it!"

123
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:45,710
I could never say that.

124
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,563
You are a musician, no?
I could never say that. You are a musician, no?

125
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:48,916
I-I-I don't know.

126
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:51,307
I mean, I only really
play for myself.

127
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:54,369
Ah! Did de la Cruz become
the world's best musician

128
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:56,483
by hiding his sweet,
sweet skills?

129
00:06:56,521 --> 00:06:57,491
No!

130
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,497
He walked out onto that plaza

131
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:01,552
and he played out loud!

132
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:02,772
Mira, Mira, they're
setting up for tonight.

133
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:05,354
The music competition for
Día de Muertos.

134
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:08,101
You wanna be like your hero?
You should sign up!

135
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,808
Unh-unh. My family would freak!

136
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:15,379
Look, if you're too scared,
then, well, have fun making shoes.

137
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:18,336
Come on, what did
de la Cruz always say?

138
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:20,488
Seize your moment?

139
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:24,213
Show me what you got,
muchacho.

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,977
I'll be your first audience.

141
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:33,401
Miguel!

142
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,227
Ah!

143
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,090
Abuelita!

144
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:37,626
What are you doing here?

145
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:39,364
Um... oh... uh...

146
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,064
You leave my grandson alone!

147
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:43,704
DoÃ±a, please! I was just
getting a shine.

148
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:45,230
I know your tricks, mariachi.

149
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,354
What did he say to you?

150
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,957
He was just showing me
his guitar.

151
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:49,503
Shame on you!

152
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:52,087
My grandson is a
is a sweet little

153
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:55,380
angelito, perrito, cielito!

154
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,924
He wants no part
of your music, mariachi.

155
00:07:57,953 --> 00:07:59,517
You keep away from him.

156
00:08:02,322 --> 00:08:04,184
Ay, pobrecito!

157
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:06,335
Estas bien, mijo.

158
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:10,080
You know better than
to be here in this place.

159
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:12,855
You will come home.
Now.

160
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:24,281
How many times
have we told you?

161
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,450
That plaza is crawling
with mariachis.

162
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:28,169
Yes, TÃ­o Berto.

163
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,543
No, no, no, no, no.

164
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:31,635
Hey, go away, you. Go!

165
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:33,057
It's just Dante.

166
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:34,843
Never name a street dog.

167
00:08:34,863 --> 00:08:36,197
They'll follow you forever.

168
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:37,992
Now, go get my shoe.

169
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,423
I found your son in
Mariachi Plaza.

170
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,795
Ay, Miguel?

171
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:49,966
You know how abuelita
feels about the plaza.

172
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:51,204
I was just shining shoes.

173
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:52,702
A musician's shoes.

174
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:56,783
But the plaza's where
the foot traffic is.

175
00:08:56,812 --> 00:09:00,422
If abuelita says, "No more plaza",
then no more plaza.

176
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:01,661
But what about tonight?

177
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,621
What's tonight?

178
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,415
Well, they're having
this talent show.

179
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:08,324
- A-and I thought I might...
- Sign up?

180
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:10,379
Well, maybe?

181
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:13,078
You have to have talent
to be in a talent show.

182
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:15,891
What are you gonna do?
Shine shoes? Oh!

183
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,963
It's Día de los Muertos.
No one's going any where.

184
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,739
Tonight is about family.

185
00:09:21,383 --> 00:09:23,342
Ofrenda room. VÃ¡monos.

186
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,440
Don't give me that look.

187
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:37,936
Día de los Muertos is the
one night of the year

188
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:40,135
our ancestors can come visit us.

189
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,026
We put their photos
on the ofrenda

190
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:44,033
so their spririts can cross over.

191
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:45,925
That is very important.

192
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:48,555
If we don't put them up,
they can't come.

193
00:09:48,574 --> 00:09:49,977
We made all this food.

194
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,972
Set out the things
they loved in life, mijo.

195
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:56,228
All this work to
bring the family together.

196
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:58,734
I don't want you sneaking off
to who-knows-where.

197
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:00,788
Huh! Where are you going?

198
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,256
- I thought we were done.
- Ay, Dios mÃ­o.

199
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:06,694
Being part of this family means
being here for this family.

200
00:10:06,713 --> 00:10:09,208
I don't want to see you
end up like...

201
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:10,601
Like Mamá Coco's Papá?

202
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,224
Never mention that man!

203
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:13,347
He's better off forgotten.

204
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:14,633
- But you're the one who...
- Eh, thchhsss!

205
00:10:14,662 --> 00:10:16,017
- I was just...
- Tchsshh!

206
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:16,708
- But...
- Tchshh.

207
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:17,448
- I...
- Shhh.

208
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:18,618
Papá?

209
00:10:18,637 --> 00:10:20,280
Papá is home?

210
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:22,622
Mamá, cÃ¡lmese, cÃ¡lmese.

211
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:24,360
Papá is coming home?

212
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:27,951
No, Mamá, it's okay.
I'm here.

213
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:30,102
Who are you?

214
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,743
Ay... rest, Mamá.

215
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:36,209
I'm hard on you
because I care, Miguel.

216
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:37,736
Miguel?

217
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:39,320
Miguel?

218
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:41,029
Ay.

219
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,823
What are we going to do
with that boy?

220
00:10:44,716 --> 00:10:46,588
Ha ha ha, you're right.

221
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:48,682
That's just what he needs.

222
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:11,131
Huah!

223
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:13,444
Oh, it's you. Get in here.

224
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,067
Come on, Dante. Hurry up.

225
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:18,428
You're gonna get me
in trouble, boy.

226
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:19,944
Someone can hear me.

227
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:25,821
I wish someone
wanted to hear me.

228
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:28,596
Other than you.

229
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:30,420
Ew, okay!

230
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:33,475
Perfecto.

231
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,820
I have to sing.

232
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:08,367
I have to play.

233
00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:11,065
The music, it's...
it's not just in me.

234
00:12:11,257 --> 00:12:12,966
It is me.

235
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,837
When life gets me down.

236
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:17,354
I play my guitar.

237
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,368
The rest of the world may
follow the rules, but I...

238
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:23,297
must follow my heart.

239
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:24,651
Ugh.

240
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,131
You know that feeling...

241
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,675
like there's a song in the air

242
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:29,808
and it's playing just for you?

243
00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:35,924
♪ A feeling so close ♪

244
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:39,831
♪ You could reach out
and touch it ♪

245
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,559
♪ I never knew ♪

246
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:45,189
♪ I could want something
so much ♪

247
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:46,793
♪ But it's true ♪

248
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:48,963
You must have faith, sister.

249
00:12:48,992 --> 00:12:51,210
Oh, but Padre,
he will never listen.

250
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:53,322
He will listen to music!

251
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:56,049
♪ Only a song, only a song ♪

252
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:59,688
♪ Has the power
to change a heart ♪

253
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:06,121
Never underestimate
the power of music.

254
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:11,796
But my father,

255
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,525
he will never give
his permission.

256
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,627
I am done
asking permission.

257
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,683
When you see your moment,

258
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:18,239
you mustn't let it pass you by.

259
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:20,236
You must seize it.

260
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:21,570
Señor de la Cruz,

261
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:24,028
what did it take for you
to seize your moment?

262
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:28,339
I had to have faith
in my dream.

263
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:30,298
No one was going to hand it to me.

264
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:32,641
It was up to me to
reach for that dream.

265
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,197
Grab it tight...

266
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:36,098
and make it come true.

267
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:42,148
No more hiding, Dante.

268
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:43,750
I gotta seize my moment.

269
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,707
I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza
if it kills me.

270
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:54,101
Día de Muertos has begun!

271
00:13:54,513 --> 00:13:55,973
No, no, no, no, no.

272
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,827
We have to make a clear path.

273
00:13:57,846 --> 00:14:00,045
The petals guide
our ancestors home.

274
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:08,763
- Mamá!
- Hunh!

275
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,212
Where should we put this table?

276
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:11,393
In the courtyard, mijos.

277
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:12,633
You want it down
by the kitchen?

278
00:14:12,662 --> 00:14:15,225
Si, eh, next to the other one.

279
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:18,643
Get under, get under!

280
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,410
Miguel?

281
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:21,350
Uh, nothing.

282
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:23,569
Mamá, Papá, I...

283
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:25,624
Miguel, your abuelita have

284
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:28,398
the most wonderful idea.

285
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:29,762
We've all decided...

286
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:32,402
it's time you joined us
in the workshop!

287
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:33,180
What?

288
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:34,823
No more shining shoes.

289
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:37,559
You will be making them,
every day, after school.

290
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:40,401
Oh, our Miguelitititito

291
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,022
carrying on the family tradition.

292
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,962
And on Día de los Muertos!

293
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,938
Your ancestors
would be so proud.

294
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:51,318
You'll craft huaraches
just like your TÃ­a Victoria.

295
00:14:51,347 --> 00:14:53,872
And wing tips just like
your Papá Julio.

296
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:56,580
But what if I'm no good
at making shoes?

297
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:57,934
Ay, Miguel.

298
00:14:57,953 --> 00:15:00,276
You have your family here
to guide you.

299
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:02,524
You are a Rivera.

300
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:05,365
And a Rivera is?

301
00:15:05,385 --> 00:15:07,305
A shoemaker...

302
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:08,323
through and through.

303
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,638
That's my boy!

304
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:12,404
Haha! Berto!
Break out the good stuff!

305
00:15:14,017 --> 00:15:16,052
Mm, mm, mm, mwah!

306
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,088
Dante!

307
00:15:25,807 --> 00:15:27,123
No, Dante, stop!

308
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,498
Hunh!

309
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:36,657
Ah!

310
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:38,271
No, no, no, no, no!

311
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:40,105
No.

312
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,979
De la Cruz' guitar?

313
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:55,179
Ah?

314
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,158
Papá?

315
00:15:57,897 --> 00:15:59,308
Mamá Coco.

316
00:15:59,384 --> 00:16:02,093
Is your Papá Ernesto de la Cruz?

317
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:04,637
Papá! Papá!

318
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:15,371
Haha!

319
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:16,581
Papá, Papá!

320
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,782
It's him!

321
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,481
I know who my
great-great-grandfather was!

322
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,354
Miguel, get down from there.

323
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:23,822
Mamá Coco's father
was Ernesto de la Cruz!

324
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:25,395
What are you talking about?

325
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:27,172
I'm gonna be a musician!

326
00:16:28,977 --> 00:16:30,273
What is all this?

327
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:32,463
You keep secrets
from your own family?

328
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,335
It's all that time he spends
in the plaza.

329
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:36,216
Fills his head
with crazy fantasies.

330
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:37,398
It's not a fantasy.

331
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:39,559
That man was
Ernesto de la Cruz.

332
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:41,219
The greatest musician
of all time.

333
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:42,967
We've never known
anything about this man.

334
00:16:42,996 --> 00:16:46,404
Or whoever he was,
he still abandoned his family.

335
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:47,768
It's no future for my son.

336
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:50,669
Well, Papá, y-you said
my family would guide me.

337
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:52,838
Well, de la Cruz is my family.

338
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:54,509
I'm supposed to play music.

339
00:16:54,528 --> 00:16:56,871
Never! That man's music
was a curse.

340
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,397
I will not allow it.

341
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,193
- If you would just...
- Miguel.

342
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:01,403
You will listen to your family.

343
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:03,102
No more music.

344
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:04,312
Just listen to me play.

345
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:05,666
End of argument.

346
00:17:07,337 --> 00:17:09,132
You want to end up
like that man?

347
00:17:09,151 --> 00:17:10,265
Forgotten?

348
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:12,445
Left off your family's ofrenda?

349
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,547
I don't care if I'm on some
stupid ofrenda.

350
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,458
- Hunh!
- Hunh!

351
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,415
- No!
- Mamá!

352
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:24,773
There.

353
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,060
No guitar.

354
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,491
No music.

355
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:31,485
Aw, come.

356
00:17:31,513 --> 00:17:34,634
You'll feel better after
you eat with your family.

357
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,267
I don't wanna be in this family!

358
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,533
Miguel, Miguel!

359
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,120
I-I wanna play in the plaza.

360
00:17:58,149 --> 00:17:59,147
Like de la Cruz.

361
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:00,560
C-can I still sign up?

362
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:01,586
You got an instrument?

363
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:04,169
No. But if I can borrow a guitar.

364
00:18:04,198 --> 00:18:06,061
Musicians gotta bring
their own instruments.

365
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,797
You find a guitar, kid,
I'll put you on the list.

366
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:13,550
Hey, excuse me,
can I borrow your guitar?

367
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:14,847
Sorry, muchaco.

368
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,344
You guys have a spare guitar?

369
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,256
No.

370
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:19,513
I need a guitar
just for a little bit.

371
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:21,030
Get outta here, kid.

372
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,135
Great-great-grandfather.

373
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,382
What am I supposed to do?

374
00:18:39,864 --> 00:19:13,382
.:: HDMovie8.Com ::.
Watch Movies and Series Free!

375
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:15,779
No, no, no, no.
Dante, stop.

376
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:17,776
CÃ¡llate, shh.

377
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:39,793
I'm sorry.

378
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:16,174
Señor de la Cruz.

379
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,507
Please don't be mad.

380
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:19,958
I-I'm Miguel.

381
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,714
Your great-great-grandson.

382
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,192
I-I need to borrow this.

383
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:29,357
Our family thinks
music is a curse.

384
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:32,861
None of them understand.
But I know you would have.

385
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:35,445
You would have told me
to follow my heart.

386
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:37,393
To seize my moment.

387
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,023
So, if it's all right with you...

388
00:20:41,052 --> 00:20:42,646
I'm gonna play in the Plaza.

389
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,451
Just like you did!

390
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:53,276
Huh?

391
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:54,677
What's going on?

392
00:20:54,706 --> 00:20:56,368
Somebody stole
de la Cruz' guitar.

393
00:20:56,444 --> 00:20:58,873
The window is broken, look!

394
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:04,471
All right, who's in there?

395
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,439
I'm sorry, i-it's not
what it looks like.

396
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:08,216
De la Cruz is my...

397
00:21:08,927 --> 00:21:09,579
Huh!

398
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:10,799
There's nobody here!

399
00:21:26,046 --> 00:21:27,227
- Miguel!
- Mamá!

400
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:28,908
Miguel, come home!

401
00:21:34,765 --> 00:21:37,760
Dios mio, little boy!
Are you okay?

402
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:39,556
Here, let me help you.

403
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:41,927
Thanks. I...

404
00:21:42,897 --> 00:21:44,539
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

405
00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:48,485
Aah!

406
00:21:50,195 --> 00:21:51,117
Aah!

407
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:53,314
Do you mind?

408
00:21:53,526 --> 00:21:54,880
- Aah!
- Aah!

409
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:16,311
Look how big she's getting.

410
00:22:19,595 --> 00:22:21,333
Uh! Dante?

411
00:22:21,352 --> 00:22:22,620
You can see me?

412
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:25,827
Wait! What's going on?

413
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,284
Dante! Dante!

414
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:30,302
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

415
00:22:30,321 --> 00:22:31,146
Miguel?

416
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:32,999
- Miguel?
- Miguel?

417
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:37,579
Y-you're here!

418
00:22:37,598 --> 00:22:38,587
Here here.

419
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:39,788
And you can see us?

420
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:42,485
Our Miguelitititito!

421
00:22:42,504 --> 00:22:43,888
Remind me how I know you?

422
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:45,318
We're your family, mijo.

423
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:49,188
TÃ­a Rosita?

424
00:22:49,217 --> 00:22:50,426
Si.

425
00:22:52,135 --> 00:22:53,249
Papá Julio?

426
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:54,431
Hola!

427
00:22:54,642 --> 00:22:56,601
TÃ­a Vic...toria?

428
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:58,828
He doesn't seem
entirely dead.

429
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:01,295
He's not quite alive, either.

430
00:23:01,324 --> 00:23:02,745
We need Mamá Imelda.

431
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:04,224
She'll know how to fix this.

432
00:23:04,253 --> 00:23:05,386
Oye!

433
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:07,816
It's Mamá Imelda!

434
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,159
She couldn't cross over!

435
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:09,956
She's stuck!

436
00:23:09,985 --> 00:23:11,397
On the other side!

437
00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:12,827
TÃ­o Oscar?

438
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:14,229
TÃ­o Felipe?

439
00:23:14,258 --> 00:23:15,458
Oh, hey, Miguel.

440
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:18,743
I have a feeling this has
something to do with you.

441
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,489
But if Mamá Imelda
can't come to us...

442
00:23:20,518 --> 00:23:22,209
Then we are going to her!

443
00:23:22,228 --> 00:23:23,150
- Whoa!
- VÃ¡monos!

444
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:37,772
Whoa.

445
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,326
Come on, Miguel, it's-it's okay.

446
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,462
Dante?

447
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,787
Dante!

448
00:23:55,805 --> 00:23:56,890
Dante, wait up!

449
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:00,779
You've gotta stay with me, boy.

450
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:02,622
You don't know...

451
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:04,408
where...

452
00:24:23,304 --> 00:24:24,840
This isn't a dream, then.

453
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:26,646
You're all really out there.

454
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:27,740
You thought we weren't?

455
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:28,920
Oh, I don't know.

456
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:31,168
I thought it might have been
one of those made-up things...

457
00:24:31,197 --> 00:24:32,762
that adults tell kids, like...

458
00:24:32,782 --> 00:24:33,424
vitamins.

459
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:35,642
Miguel, vitamins
are a real thing.

460
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:37,448
Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.

461
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:38,341
Hunh!

462
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,857
Mija, it's not nice to stare at...

463
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,605
Ay, Santa Ma...

464
00:24:49,335 --> 00:24:50,409
Are those?

465
00:24:50,428 --> 00:24:52,003
Alebrijes!

466
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,943
- But those are...
- Real alebrijes.

467
00:24:53,972 --> 00:24:55,557
Spirit creatures.

468
00:24:55,584 --> 00:24:57,150
They guide souls
on their journey.

469
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:59,695
Watch your step,
they make cacitas everywhere.

470
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:01,586
Welcome back
to the Land of the Dead.

471
00:25:01,605 --> 00:25:04,208
Please have all offerings
ready for re-entry.

472
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:05,465
Welcome back.

473
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:06,656
Anything to declare?

474
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:08,192
Some churros, from my family.

475
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:09,383
How wonderful!

476
00:25:09,402 --> 00:25:11,744
If you're experiencing
travel issues...

477
00:25:11,773 --> 00:25:13,886
Agents at the Department of
Family Reunion

478
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:15,663
are available to assist you.

479
00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:17,217
Next family, please.

480
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:23,458
Oh, your photos are
in your son's ofrenda.

481
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:24,468
Have a great visit.

482
00:25:24,487 --> 00:25:25,600
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

483
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:27,550
And remember to return
before sunrise.

484
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:28,730
Enjoy your visit!

485
00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:29,661
Next?

486
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:32,792
Your photo's on your
dentist's ofrenda.

487
00:25:32,812 --> 00:25:34,164
Enjoy your visit.

488
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:35,154
Grashiash.

489
00:25:35,173 --> 00:25:36,163
Next?

490
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:40,300
Yes, it is I, Frida Kahlo.

491
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:41,722
Shall we skip the scanner?

492
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:43,152
I'm on so many ofrendas

493
00:25:43,181 --> 00:25:45,715
it will just overwhelm your
blinky thingy.

494
00:25:46,926 --> 00:25:47,915
Whoa, shoot.

495
00:25:47,954 --> 00:25:49,988
Looks like no one
put up your photo...

496
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,381
Frida?

497
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,849
Okay, when I said
I was Frida, just now...

498
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:54,674
That.

499
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:55,576
That was a lie.

500
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,517
And I apologize for doing that.

501
00:25:57,546 --> 00:25:59,466
No photo on an ofrenda,
no crossing the bridge.

502
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:00,339
You know what?

503
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:03,134
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.

504
00:26:05,543 --> 00:26:06,638
Haha!

505
00:26:11,784 --> 00:26:13,484
Almost... there...

506
00:26:13,513 --> 00:26:15,568
Just a little... further...

507
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:18,803
Ugh.

508
00:26:19,918 --> 00:26:21,099
Upsy daisy.

509
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:23,229
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?

510
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:25,276
Dumb flower bridge!

511
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:28,626
Aw, I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.

512
00:26:28,645 --> 00:26:29,423
Next?

513
00:26:29,452 --> 00:26:31,152
Oh, come mijo, it's our turn.

514
00:26:31,171 --> 00:26:32,707
Welcome back, amigo.

515
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:33,926
Anything to declare?

516
00:26:33,955 --> 00:26:35,693
A-as a matter of fact...

517
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:36,884
Yes.

518
00:26:37,661 --> 00:26:38,381
Hola.

519
00:26:45,823 --> 00:26:47,417
Paging Marta Gonzalez Ramos...

520
00:26:47,763 --> 00:26:48,828
Marta Gonzalez Ramos...

521
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,191
Please report to level seven.

522
00:26:54,877 --> 00:26:55,780
Whoa.

523
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:00,839
I miss my nose.

524
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:11,593
Come on, help us out, amigo.

525
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:13,312
We gotta get to a
dozen ofrendas tonight.

526
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:16,020
We are not visiting
your ex-wife, Stanley,

527
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,096
por Día de Muertos.

528
00:27:17,115 --> 00:27:19,544
I demand to speak to the
person in charge.

529
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:21,243
I'm sorry, Señora, it says here

530
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,502
no one put up your photo.

531
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:26,678
My family always, always
put my photo up in the ofrenda

532
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:29,617
That devil box tells you
nothing but lies.

533
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:31,268
Mamá Imelda?

534
00:27:32,324 --> 00:27:34,004
Oh, mi familia.

535
00:27:34,034 --> 00:27:35,858
They wouldn't let me
cross the bridge.

536
00:27:35,877 --> 00:27:38,200
Tell this woman and her
devil box

537
00:27:38,229 --> 00:27:40,563
that my photo is in the ofrenda.

538
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,856
Well, w-we never
made it to the ofrenda.

539
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:44,884
What?

540
00:27:44,903 --> 00:27:46,419
We ran into a...

541
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:48,195
um...

542
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:51,336
Hunh! Miguel?

543
00:27:51,374 --> 00:27:53,217
Mamá Imelda.

544
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,580
What is going on?

545
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,942
You the Rivera family?

546
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:01,005
Well, you're cursed.

547
00:28:01,168 --> 00:28:01,994
What?

548
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,326
Día de los Muertos
is a night to give to the dead.

549
00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:05,805
You stole from the dead.

550
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,553
But I wasn't sealing the guitar.

551
00:28:07,592 --> 00:28:08,504
Guitar?

552
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:09,693
It was my
great-great-grandfather's.

553
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:10,837
He would have
wanted me to have it.

554
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,938
Ah-ah-ah! We do not speak
of that musician.

555
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:15,887
He is dead to this family.

556
00:28:15,906 --> 00:28:17,654
Uh, you're all dead.

557
00:28:17,673 --> 00:28:18,556
Achoo!

558
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:21,254
I am sorry, uh,
who's alebrije is that?

559
00:28:21,273 --> 00:28:22,214
That's Dante.

560
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,376
He sure doesn't look
like an alebrije.

561
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:25,931
He just looks like
a plain old dog.

562
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,187
Or a sausage someone
dropped in a barbershop.

563
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,502
Whatever he is, I am-
achoo!

564
00:28:30,521 --> 00:28:31,797
terribly allergic.

565
00:28:31,816 --> 00:28:33,622
But Dante doesn't have any hair.

566
00:28:33,641 --> 00:28:36,042
And I don't have a nose
and yet here we are.

567
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:37,212
Achoo!

568
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:40,814
But none of this explains
why I couldn't cross over.

569
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,349
Oh...

570
00:28:43,752 --> 00:28:46,306
You took my photo
off the ofrenda?

571
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:47,458
It was an accident.

572
00:28:47,487 --> 00:28:48,706
How do we send him back?

573
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:50,877
Well, since it's a family matter...

574
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,343
The way to undo a family curse is

575
00:28:53,362 --> 00:28:55,091
to get your family's blessing.

576
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,984
That's it?

577
00:28:56,013 --> 00:28:57,281
Get your family's blessing

578
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,883
and everything should
go back to normal.

579
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:01,890
But you've gotta do it by sunrise.

580
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:03,357
What happens at sunrise?

581
00:29:03,387 --> 00:29:05,279
HÃ­jole, your hand!

582
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:06,911
Huh!

583
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,104
Whoa, Miguel.
Can't have you fainting on us.

584
00:29:13,422 --> 00:29:14,813
But not to worry.

585
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:15,840
Your family is here.

586
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:17,665
You can get your
blessing right now.

587
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:19,854
Cempasuchil, cempasuchil.

588
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,996
Aha!

589
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:22,245
PerdÃ³n, Señora.

590
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:23,119
Oh.

591
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:25,865
Now, you look at the living
and say his name.

592
00:29:26,873 --> 00:29:27,632
Miguel.

593
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:28,602
Nailed it.

594
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:31,011
Now say,
"I give you my blessing."

595
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,797
I give you my blessing.

596
00:29:35,256 --> 00:29:38,290
I give you my blessing
to go home...

597
00:29:38,453 --> 00:29:41,793
To put my photo back
on the ofrenda...

598
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:43,916
And to never play music again.

599
00:29:43,945 --> 00:29:45,712
What? She can't do that!

600
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:48,996
Well, technically, she can add
any condition she wants.

601
00:29:49,937 --> 00:29:50,830
Fine.

602
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:52,903
Then you
hand the petal to Miguel.

603
00:30:00,268 --> 00:30:01,219
Ha!

604
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:06,404
No skeletons.

605
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:12,319
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.

606
00:30:16,437 --> 00:30:18,703
Two seconds and you
already break your promise.

607
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:20,537
This isn't fair, it's my life.

608
00:30:20,566 --> 00:30:22,141
You already had yours.

609
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,368
Papá Julio,
I ask for your blessing.

610
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:26,250
TÃ­a Rosita?

611
00:30:26,817 --> 00:30:27,816
Oscar?

612
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:28,642
Felipe?

613
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,802
TÃ­a Victoria?

614
00:30:29,965 --> 00:30:31,531
Don't make this hard, mijo.

615
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,249
You go home my way,
or no way.

616
00:30:34,268 --> 00:30:35,881
You really hate music
that much?

617
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:38,829
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.

618
00:30:41,536 --> 00:30:43,456
The same path he did.

619
00:30:44,263 --> 00:30:45,598
He's family.

620
00:30:45,617 --> 00:30:47,058
Listen to your Mamá Imelda.

621
00:30:47,077 --> 00:30:48,008
She's just looking out for you.

622
00:30:48,027 --> 00:30:49,487
Be reasonable.

623
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:52,473
Con permiso,
I need to visit the rest room.

624
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:54,633
Be right back.

625
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:56,524
Ah, should we tell him

626
00:30:56,553 --> 00:30:58,685
there are no restrooms
in the Land of the Dead?

627
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,204
VÃ¡monos.

628
00:31:12,626 --> 00:31:14,403
We got a family looking
for a living boy.

629
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,341
I wanna be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.

630
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,223
We gotta find my
great-great-grandpa.

631
00:31:19,243 --> 00:31:20,308
Hold it, muchaco.

632
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:21,211
Huh!

633
00:31:24,235 --> 00:31:25,896
I found that little boy!

634
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,846
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me, folks.

635
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:29,487
Excuse me.

636
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,062
Oh.

637
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,102
Dante.

638
00:31:37,246 --> 00:31:38,686
Disturbing the peace.

639
00:31:38,715 --> 00:31:40,078
Fleeing an officer.

640
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,816
Falsifying a unibrow.

641
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:42,901
That's illegal?

642
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,237
Very illegal.

643
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:46,406
You need to clean up
your act, amigo.

644
00:31:46,425 --> 00:31:47,395
Amigo?

645
00:31:47,414 --> 00:31:50,159
Oh, that's-that's so nice
to hear you say that because

646
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:53,155
I have just had a really
hard Día de Muertos

647
00:31:53,176 --> 00:31:55,135
and I could really use
an amigo right now.

648
00:31:55,154 --> 00:31:57,995
And amigos, they help
their amigos.

649
00:31:58,024 --> 00:32:00,483
Listen, you get me across
that bridge tonight...

650
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:02,326
and I'll make it
worth your while.

651
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:03,574
You like de la Cruz?

652
00:32:03,593 --> 00:32:04,794
He and I go way back.

653
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:08,077
I can get you front row seats
to his sunrise spectacular show.

654
00:32:08,105 --> 00:32:10,382
I-I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.

655
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:11,966
You just gotta let me
cross that bridge.

656
00:32:11,994 --> 00:32:14,232
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.

657
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:16,171
But my shift's almost up and...

658
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,053
I wanna visit my living family.

659
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:20,646
So I'm letting you off
with a warning.

660
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,487
Can I at least
get my costume back?

661
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:24,938
Uh... no.

662
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:27,779
Ser maldito.

663
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:30,786
Hey.

664
00:32:31,045 --> 00:32:32,130
Hey!

665
00:32:32,206 --> 00:32:33,608
You really know de la Cruz?

666
00:32:33,656 --> 00:32:36,105
Who wants to... ah! Ay!
You're alive!

667
00:32:36,124 --> 00:32:37,507
Yeah, I'm alive.

668
00:32:37,526 --> 00:32:39,580
And I want to get back to
the Land of the Living...

669
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:40,819
I need de la Cruz' blessing.

670
00:32:40,848 --> 00:32:42,307
That's weirdly specific.

671
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,948
He's my great-great-grandfather.

672
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:46,618
He's your gr-gr-gr-
what?

673
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,117
Ew.

674
00:32:48,578 --> 00:32:50,314
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

675
00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:51,429
Wait, wait.

676
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:52,725
Hunh!

677
00:32:52,936 --> 00:32:54,558
Wait. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait

678
00:32:54,587 --> 00:32:55,192
Wait, uh, wait,

679
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:55,509
Wait, uh, wait, wait,

680
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:55,807
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait,

681
00:32:55,827 --> 00:32:56,172
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait,

682
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:56,517
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

683
00:32:56,536 --> 00:32:56,816
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

684
00:32:56,854 --> 00:32:59,254
Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!

685
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:01,011
You know what? Maybe this
isn't such a good...

686
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,874
NiÃ±o, niÃ±o, I can help you.

687
00:33:02,903 --> 00:33:04,699
You can help me.
We can help each other.

688
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:06,475
But most importantly,
you can help me.

689
00:33:06,494 --> 00:33:07,464
- Miguel!
- Huh!

690
00:33:07,483 --> 00:33:09,375
- I'm Héctor.
- That's nice.

691
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:15,568
Esperame, chamaco!

692
00:33:23,105 --> 00:33:25,468
Ay! He is going
to get himself killed!

693
00:33:25,496 --> 00:33:27,320
I need my spirit guide...

694
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,558
Pepita.

695
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:42,233
Who has that petal
Miguel touched?

696
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:45,323
Here... n-nice alebrije.

697
00:33:57,346 --> 00:33:59,131
Hey, hey, hold still.

698
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,590
Look up, look up.
A ver, a ver.

699
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:02,079
Look up, up, up!

700
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:08,857
Okay.

701
00:34:08,886 --> 00:34:10,537
Eh. Ta-da!

702
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:12,996
Dead as a doorknob.

703
00:34:14,023 --> 00:34:17,038
So listen, Miguel.
This place runs on memories.

704
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:19,323
When you're well remembered,
people put up your photo...

705
00:34:19,352 --> 00:34:20,725
and you get to cross the bridge

706
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:22,895
and visit the living on
Día de Muertos.

707
00:34:22,914 --> 00:34:24,066
Unless you're me.

708
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:25,373
You don't get to cross over?

709
00:34:25,392 --> 00:34:27,014
No one's ever put up my picture.

710
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:28,714
But you can change that!

711
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:30,347
This is you?

712
00:34:30,376 --> 00:34:31,738
Eh, Muy guapo, eh?

713
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:34,869
So, you get me to my
great-great-grandpa...

714
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:37,345
Then I put up your photo
when I get home?

715
00:34:37,364 --> 00:34:38,757
Such a smart boy!

716
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:40,524
Yes! Great idea, yes!

717
00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:43,174
One hiccup, de la Cruz
is a tough guy to get to...

718
00:34:43,193 --> 00:34:45,777
and I need to cross that
bridge soon. Like tonight.

719
00:34:45,805 --> 00:34:47,552
So, you got any other
family here, you know?

720
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:49,885
Someone a bit more, eh,
accessible?

721
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:51,202
Um... nope.

722
00:34:51,221 --> 00:34:52,766
Don't yank my chain, chamaco.

723
00:34:52,785 --> 00:34:54,283
You gotta have
some other family.

724
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:55,733
Only de la Cruz.

725
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,827
If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.

726
00:34:59,065 --> 00:35:01,168
Ugh. Okay, okay, kid.
Fine, fine.

727
00:35:01,197 --> 00:35:02,964
I'll get you to your
great-great-grandpa.

728
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:05,901
It's not gonna be easy,
you know.

729
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,553
You know, he's a-
he's a busy man.

730
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:09,196
Wait, what are you doing?

731
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:11,586
I'm walking like a skeleton.
Blending in.

732
00:35:11,615 --> 00:35:13,228
No. Skeletons don't
walk like that.

733
00:35:13,256 --> 00:35:14,275
It's how you walk.

734
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:15,359
No, I don't.

735
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:17,107
Stop it!

736
00:35:17,136 --> 00:35:18,393
Whoa!

737
00:35:18,413 --> 00:35:21,206
Ernesto de la Cruz'
Sunrise Spectacular?

738
00:35:21,225 --> 00:35:22,224
Que padre?

739
00:35:22,244 --> 00:35:24,481
Wuacch, every year,
your great-great-grandpa

740
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,313
puts on that dumb show
to mark the end of Día de Muertos.

741
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:28,802
A-a-and you can get us in!

742
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:29,734
I'm...

743
00:35:29,782 --> 00:35:31,557
Hey, you said you had
front-row tickets!

744
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:32,393
That...

745
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,248
that was a lie.

746
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:34,746
I apologize for that.

747
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,819
Cool off, chamaco, come on.
I'll get you to him.

748
00:35:36,857 --> 00:35:37,731
How?

749
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:40,064
'Cause I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.

750
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:52,940
Ugh.

751
00:35:55,168 --> 00:35:57,396
You better have
my dress, Héctor.

752
00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:58,816
Hola, Ceci!

753
00:36:00,017 --> 00:36:01,093
Ay!

754
00:36:04,482 --> 00:36:05,404
Hola.

755
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:07,449
Cezi!

756
00:36:07,468 --> 00:36:08,552
I lost the dress.

757
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:10,031
Ay, diosa Mia!

758
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:12,192
I've got to dress 40 dancers
by sunrise.

759
00:36:12,356 --> 00:36:13,537
- And thanks to you...
- Cezi, Cezi...

760
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,650
- I'm one Frida short
- Cezi...

761
00:36:14,669 --> 00:36:15,918
of an opening number.
- Dante.

762
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,502
Dante!

763
00:36:18,674 --> 00:36:20,075
We shouldn't be in here.

764
00:36:34,795 --> 00:36:36,552
Dante! Ven acÃ¡!

765
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:47,162
You!
How did you get in here?

766
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:48,237
I-I just followed my...

767
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:51,108
Hunh! Oh, the mighty Xolo dog!

768
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:53,557
Guider of wandering spirits.

769
00:36:54,277 --> 00:36:56,754
And whose spirit
have you guided to me?

770
00:36:56,773 --> 00:36:59,202
I don't think he's a spirit guide.

771
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:02,716
Uh-uh-uh! The alebrijes of this
world can take many forms.

772
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:05,587
They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.

773
00:37:11,252 --> 00:37:13,115
Or maybe he's just a dog.

774
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:15,208
Come! I need your eyes.

775
00:37:15,794 --> 00:37:17,734
Your are the audience.

776
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:20,009
Darkness!

777
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:22,122
And from the darkness...

778
00:37:22,141 --> 00:37:24,329
A giant papaya!

779
00:37:25,347 --> 00:37:27,662
Dancers emerge from the papaya.

780
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,332
And the dancers...

781
00:37:29,351 --> 00:37:30,849
Are all me!

782
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:34,661
And they go to drink
from the milk of their mother.

783
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:37,494
Who is a cactus.
But who is also me!

784
00:37:37,513 --> 00:37:39,770
And her milk is not milk...

785
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:41,478
but tears.

786
00:37:42,535 --> 00:37:43,908
Is it too obvious?

787
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,038
I think it's just the
right amount of obvious.

788
00:37:47,326 --> 00:37:48,940
It could use some music.

789
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:50,389
Oh, what if you did like...

790
00:37:50,456 --> 00:37:51,906
Tun-tun-tun-tun-tun?

791
00:37:53,558 --> 00:37:55,085
Oh, and then it could go...

792
00:37:55,152 --> 00:37:57,917
Darala-dalala-dalala-dalala
Whenk?

793
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,497
And what if everything was on fire?

794
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,109
Yes! Fire everywhere!

795
00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:06,559
Inspired.

796
00:38:06,597 --> 00:38:09,295
You. You have
the spirit of an artist.

797
00:38:11,187 --> 00:38:14,029
The dancers exit. The music fades.
The lights go out.

798
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:17,149
And Ernesto de la Cruz
rises to the stage.

799
00:38:20,922 --> 00:38:21,710
Huh?

800
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:24,562
He does a couple of songs.
The sun rises. Everyone cheers.

801
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:26,569
Excuse me, where's
the real de la Cruz?

802
00:38:26,636 --> 00:38:28,345
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals.

803
00:38:28,402 --> 00:38:32,368
He's too busy hosting that
fancy party at the top of his tower.

804
00:38:35,633 --> 00:38:37,841
Chamaco, you can't
run off on me like that.

805
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,588
Come on, stop pestering
the celebrities.

806
00:38:39,607 --> 00:38:41,701
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here.

807
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,237
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.

808
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:46,973
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?

809
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,594
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?

810
00:38:49,614 --> 00:38:52,724
He's your great-great-grandpa.
How come he didn't invite you?

811
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:54,855
Hey, Gustavo! You know
anything about this party?

812
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,737
Sh-it's the hot ticket!

813
00:38:56,757 --> 00:38:59,378
But if you're not on the guest list,
you're never gettin' in,

814
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:00,606
Chorizo.

815
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:02,297
Hey, it's Chorizo!

816
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:04,995
Ah-ha, very funny, guys.
Very funny.

817
00:39:05,014 --> 00:39:06,194
Chorizo?

818
00:39:06,223 --> 00:39:08,029
Oh, this guy's famous.

819
00:39:08,048 --> 00:39:10,103
Go on, go on.
Ask him how he died.

820
00:39:10,132 --> 00:39:11,706
I-I don't wanna talk about it.

821
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:14,318
He choked on some chorizo!

822
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,003
I didn't choke, okay?
I got food poisoning

823
00:39:19,032 --> 00:39:20,377
which is a big difference.

824
00:39:21,213 --> 00:39:22,921
This is why I don't like musicians.

825
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,755
Bunch of self-important jerks!

826
00:39:24,784 --> 00:39:26,263
Hey, I'm a musician.

827
00:39:26,292 --> 00:39:27,501
- You are?
- Well...

828
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,373
If you really wanna get to Ernesto...

829
00:39:29,402 --> 00:39:32,369
there is that music competition
at the Plaza de la Cruz.

830
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:35,086
Winner gets to play at his party.

831
00:39:35,912 --> 00:39:38,456
No, no, no, Chamaco!
You are loco if you think...

832
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:41,145
I need to get my great-great-
grandfather's blessing.

833
00:39:41,193 --> 00:39:43,307
You know where
I can get a guitar?

834
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:46,436
Ay... I know a guy.

835
00:39:57,642 --> 00:40:00,454
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?

836
00:40:01,865 --> 00:40:03,028
A footprint!

837
00:40:03,057 --> 00:40:04,497
It's a Rivera boot.

838
00:40:04,516 --> 00:40:06,205
- Size seven!
- And a half.

839
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:08,415
- Pronated.
- Miguel.

840
00:40:17,238 --> 00:40:19,255
Why the heck would you
wanna be a musician?

841
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:21,299
My great-great-grandfather's
a musician.

842
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:24,440
Who spent his life performing like
a monkey for complete strangers?

843
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:26,524
Blech! No, no, thank you, no.

844
00:40:26,572 --> 00:40:28,299
What do you know?

845
00:40:28,482 --> 00:40:30,758
So, how far is this guitar, anyway?

846
00:40:30,777 --> 00:40:32,092
We're almost there.

847
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:38,151
Keep up, chamaco, come on!

848
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:48,203
Cousin Héctor!

849
00:40:48,232 --> 00:40:49,788
Hey! These guys!

850
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:50,748
Héctor!

851
00:40:50,768 --> 00:40:52,122
Hey, tÃ­o, quÃ© onda?

852
00:40:52,141 --> 00:40:53,724
These people are all you family?

853
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,510
Eh... yeah, in a way.

854
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:58,267
We're all the ones with
no photos or ofrendas.

855
00:40:58,296 --> 00:40:59,879
No family to go home to.

856
00:40:59,908 --> 00:41:01,195
Nearly forgotten, you know?

857
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:05,401
So we all call each other
"cousin" or "tÃ­o" or-or whatever.

858
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:12,458
- Héctor!
- TÃ­a Chelos! Hey!

859
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,674
Muchas gracias.

860
00:41:15,703 --> 00:41:16,961
Save some for me.

861
00:41:16,989 --> 00:41:18,363
Is ChicharrÃ³n around?

862
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,762
In the bungalow. I don't know if
he's in the mood for visitors.

863
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:25,076
Ah, who doesn't like a
visit from cousin Héctor?

864
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:28,781
Huh!

865
00:41:33,678 --> 00:41:35,301
Buenas noches, ChicharrÃ³n.

866
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,672
I don't want to see your
stupid face, Héctor.

867
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:39,957
Come on, its Día de Muertos.

868
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:41,235
I brought you a little offering.

869
00:41:41,254 --> 00:41:42,578
Get outta here!

870
00:41:42,597 --> 00:41:44,393
I would Chich, but the thing is...

871
00:41:44,422 --> 00:41:46,487
me and my friend Miguel...

872
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:48,417
we really need to
borrow your guitar.

873
00:41:48,445 --> 00:41:49,914
- My guitar?
- Yes.

874
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:52,325
My prized, beloved guitar?

875
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,937
I promise we'll bring it right back.

876
00:41:53,966 --> 00:41:56,146
Like the time you promised
to bring back my van?

877
00:41:56,165 --> 00:41:57,106
Eh...

878
00:41:57,135 --> 00:41:58,498
- Or my mini fridge?
- Oh, you see...

879
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:01,657
Or my good napkins,
my lasso, my femur?!

880
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:02,762
No, not like those things.

881
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:04,057
Where's my femur, you...

882
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:06,160
Oh, oh.

883
00:42:06,516 --> 00:42:07,697
You okay, amigo?

884
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,260
I'm fading, Héctor.

885
00:42:10,952 --> 00:42:12,508
I can feel it.

886
00:42:13,275 --> 00:42:16,329
I couldn't even play that
thing if I wanted to.

887
00:42:19,363 --> 00:42:21,428
You, play me something.

888
00:42:21,447 --> 00:42:23,981
Oh, you know I don't
play anymore, Chich.

889
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:25,604
The guitar's for the kid.

890
00:42:25,623 --> 00:42:27,044
You want it?

891
00:42:27,073 --> 00:42:29,378
You've got to earn it.

892
00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:33,410
Ay, only for you, amigo.

893
00:42:35,716 --> 00:42:37,145
Any requests?

894
00:42:38,576 --> 00:42:40,977
You know my favorite, Héctor.

895
00:42:57,904 --> 00:43:01,592

896

00:43:19,028 --> 00:43:20,373
Those aren't the words.

901
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:21,966

00:43:48,506 --> 00:43:51,646
Brings back memories.

907
00:43:54,805 --> 00:43:56,446
Gracias.

908
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,488
Wait, what happened?

909
00:44:28,661 --> 00:44:30,513
He's been forgotten.

910
00:44:30,686 --> 00:44:33,432
When there's no one left in the
living world who remembers you...

911
00:44:33,461 --> 00:44:35,689
you disappear from this world.

912
00:44:35,919 --> 00:44:38,972
We call it "The Final Death."

913
00:44:39,424 --> 00:44:41,248
W-where did he go?

914
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:42,574
No one knows.

915
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:43,889
But I've met him.

916
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:45,991
I could remember him...
when I go back.

917
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,354
No, it doesn't work
like that, chamaco.

918
00:44:48,507 --> 00:44:50,169
Our memories...

919
00:44:50,197 --> 00:44:53,577
They have to be passed down
by those who knew us in life.

920
00:44:53,606 --> 00:44:56,275
In the stories
they tell about us.

921
00:44:56,457 --> 00:44:59,646
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Chich's stories.

922
00:45:01,642 --> 00:45:03,543
Hey, it happens to
everyone eventually.

923
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:06,894
Come on, de la Cruzito,
you've got a contest to win.

924
00:45:18,618 --> 00:45:20,203
You told me you hated musicians.

925
00:45:20,222 --> 00:45:21,720
You never said you were one.

926
00:45:21,748 --> 00:45:23,813
How do you think I knew
your great-great-grandpa?

927
00:45:23,832 --> 00:45:25,234
We used to play music together.

928
00:45:25,262 --> 00:45:26,722
Taught him everything he knows.

929
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,065
No manches.

930
00:45:28,085 --> 00:45:30,140
You played with
Ernesto de la Cruz?

931
00:45:30,169 --> 00:45:31,792
The greatest musician
of all time?

932
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,750
Oh! Oh, you're funny.

933
00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:35,690
Greatest eyebrows
of all time, maybe.

934
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:37,601
But his music, eh, not so much.

935
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,684
You don't know what
you're talking about.

936
00:45:41,586 --> 00:45:44,773
Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz.

937
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:46,866
Showtime, chamaco.

938
00:45:52,618 --> 00:45:55,038
Querer lo, t-shirts, bobbleheads.

939
00:46:01,442 --> 00:46:04,582
Bienvenidos a todos!

940
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:07,059
Ow! ha-hah-ay!

941
00:46:07,087 --> 00:46:10,478
Who's ready for some mÃºsica?

942
00:46:11,178 --> 00:46:13,752
It's a Battle of
the Bands, amigos.

943
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,670
The winner gets to play
for the maestro himself...

944
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:20,925
Ernesto de la Cruz
on his fiesta tonight!

945
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,969
That's our ticket, muchacho.

946
00:46:24,669 --> 00:46:28,749
Let the competition begin!

947
00:46:43,248 --> 00:46:45,178
So, what's the plan?
W-what are you gonna play?

948
00:46:45,207 --> 00:46:47,022
Definitely "Remember Me."

949
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:48,433
No, not that one. No.

950
00:46:48,452 --> 00:46:49,911
Come on, it's the
most popular song.

951
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,987
Ah, it's too popular.

952
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,177
♪ Remember me
though I have to travel far ♪

953
00:46:53,206 --> 00:46:54,270
♪ Remember... ♪

954
00:46:54,299 --> 00:46:56,594
♪ Don't let it make you cry ♪

955
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:02,260
Um, what about...
Poco Loco?

956
00:47:02,288 --> 00:47:04,209
Epa! Now, that's a song.

957
00:47:04,228 --> 00:47:05,908
De la Cruzito!
You're on standby.

958
00:47:05,927 --> 00:47:08,088
Los Chachalacos,
you're up next.

959
00:47:09,019 --> 00:47:11,294
Los Chachalacos!

960
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:23,441
You always this nervous
before a performance?

961
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,599
I don't know.
I've never performed before.

962
00:47:26,628 --> 00:47:28,424
What? You said
you were a musician!

963
00:47:28,443 --> 00:47:30,556
I am! I mean, I-I will be.

964
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:31,785
- Ay!
- Once I win.

965
00:47:31,804 --> 00:47:33,004
That's your plan?

966
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:34,761
No, no, no, no.
You have to win, Miguel.

967
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,432
Your life literally
depends on you winning.

968
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:37,853
And you've never
done this before?

969
00:47:37,872 --> 00:47:39,255
- I'll go up.
- Uh, n-no!

970
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:40,811
- I need to do this.
- Why?

971
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:43,009
If I can't go out there
and play one song...

972
00:47:43,037 --> 00:47:44,737
how can I call myself
a musician?

973
00:47:44,756 --> 00:47:45,766
What does that matter?

974
00:47:45,785 --> 00:47:48,482
'Cause I don't just want
to get de la Cruz' blessing.

975
00:47:48,511 --> 00:47:50,336
I need to prove that...

976
00:47:50,403 --> 00:47:52,439
that I'm worthy of it.

977
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:55,040
Oh. Oh, that's such
a sweet sentiment.

978
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:57,432
At such a bad time!

979
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:00,839
Okay! Okay, okay. Okay.

980
00:48:00,887 --> 00:48:03,798
Okay, you wanna perform?
Then you've got to perform!

981
00:48:03,827 --> 00:48:05,141
First, you have to loosen up.

982
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,476
Shake off those nerves.

983
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:11,863
Now, give me your best grito.

984
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:13,159
My best grito?

985
00:48:13,188 --> 00:48:14,648
Come on, yell. Belt it out.

986
00:48:14,676 --> 00:48:17,336
Haooeyy-he-he-hey!

987
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:19,563
Oh, it feels good.

988
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:21,329
Okay, now, now, now you.

989
00:48:21,656 --> 00:48:23,154
A-a-eh.

990
00:48:23,173 --> 00:48:24,365
Aeh...

991
00:48:24,393 --> 00:48:25,104
Ay...

992
00:48:25,123 --> 00:48:25,823
Ay...ay...

993
00:48:25,842 --> 00:48:26,514
Ay...ay...ay.

994
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:27,936
Oh, come on, kid.

995
00:48:38,056 --> 00:48:39,727
De la Cruzito!
You're on now!

996
00:48:39,746 --> 00:48:41,992
Miguel, look at me.
Hey, hey, look at me.

997
00:48:42,021 --> 00:48:42,866
Come on, let's go!

998
00:48:42,895 --> 00:48:43,721
You can do this.

999
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,652
Grab their attention
and don't let it go!

1000
00:48:45,681 --> 00:48:46,314
Héctor...

1001
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:47,830
Make them listen, chamaco.
You've got this.

1002
00:48:47,907 --> 00:48:50,068
De la Cruzito!

1003
00:48:50,087 --> 00:48:52,765
Arriba-Ba! Hey!

1004
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:57,806
Eh...

1005
00:48:58,565 --> 00:49:00,735
What's he doing?
Why isn't he playing?

1006
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:03,212
Bring back the singing dog!

1007
00:49:04,124 --> 00:49:05,113

About twelve?

1038
00:50:41,765 --> 00:50:43,609

00:50:58,328 --> 00:51:00,057
I'm proud of you.

1044

1045
00:51:10,052 --> 00:51:11,550
Hey, where are you going?

1046
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:12,615
We gotta get outta here.

We're about to win this thing.

Damas y caballeros...

1049
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,951
I have a emergency announcement.

1050
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:23,072
Please be on the look out
for a living boy.

1051
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,136
Answers to the name of Miguel.

1052
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,998
Earlier tonight, he ran away
from his family.

1053
00:51:28,027 --> 00:51:31,301
They just want to send him
back to the Land of the Living.

1054
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,616
Wait, wait, wait.

1055
00:51:32,635 --> 00:51:34,344
You said de la Cruz
was your only family.

1056
00:51:34,363 --> 00:51:35,928
The only person who
could send you home.

1057
00:51:35,948 --> 00:51:37,119
I do have other family, but...

1058
00:51:37,148 --> 00:51:39,097
You could have taken my
photo back this whole time?

1059
00:51:39,126 --> 00:51:41,988
But they hate music.
I need a musician's blessing.

1060
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,647
- You lied to me!
- Oh, you're one to talk.

1061
00:51:44,675 --> 00:51:46,567
Look at me, I'm being
forgotten, Miguel.

1062
00:51:46,586 --> 00:51:48,277
I don't even know if I'm
gonna last the night.

1063
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:50,744
I'm not gonna miss my one
chance to cross that bridge

1064
00:51:50,763 --> 00:51:53,683
'cause you want to live out
some stupid musical fantasy.

1065
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:55,688
- It's not stupid.
- I'm taking you to your family.

1066
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:57,647
- Let go of me.
- You'll thank me later.

1067
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:59,914
You don't wanna help me.
You only care about yourself.

1068
00:52:00,462 --> 00:52:02,314
Keep your dumb photo.
- No!

1069
00:52:02,334 --> 00:52:03,870
No, no, no!
- Stay away from me!

1070
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:04,542
No!

1071
00:52:06,049 --> 00:52:07,595
Hey, chamaco?

1072
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,103
Where did you go?

1073
00:52:09,871 --> 00:52:10,793
Chamaco?

1074
00:52:11,484 --> 00:52:12,453
Sorry!

1075
00:52:12,636 --> 00:52:13,596
Come back.

1076
00:52:22,784 --> 00:52:24,369
Dante, cÃ¡llate.

1077
00:52:25,301 --> 00:52:27,039
Don't Dante, stop it.

1078
00:52:27,068 --> 00:52:28,632
He can't help me.

1079
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:31,542
Dante, stop.

1080
00:52:31,764 --> 00:52:33,049
Stop it.

1081
00:52:33,135 --> 00:52:34,259
Leave me alone!

1082
00:52:34,278 --> 00:52:36,813
You're not a spirit guide,
you're just a dumb dog.

1083
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:38,368
Now get outta here!

1084
00:52:38,512 --> 00:52:39,703
It's him!

1085
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:41,000
It's that living boy!

1086
00:52:41,019 --> 00:52:42,162
I've heard about him, look!

1087
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,256
He's alive.

1088
00:52:51,706 --> 00:52:52,733
Huah!

1089
00:52:52,925 --> 00:52:54,058
Aah!

1090
00:52:54,078 --> 00:52:56,439
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!

1091
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:58,927
I am giving you my blessing,
and you are going home.

1092
00:52:58,955 --> 00:53:00,673
I don't want your blessing.

1093
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:02,863
Miguel! Stop!

1094
00:53:05,426 --> 00:53:06,617
Come back!

1095
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:09,633
Miguel!

1096
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,768
I am trying to save your life.

1097
00:53:15,797 --> 00:53:17,188
You're ruining my life.

1098
00:53:17,217 --> 00:53:18,120
What?

1099
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:19,954
Music's the only thing
that makes me happy.

1100
00:53:19,973 --> 00:53:22,748
A-and you... you wanna
take that away.

1101
00:53:22,988 --> 00:53:24,303
You'll never understand.

I-I thought you hated music.

1105
00:53:39,244 --> 00:53:42,000
Oh, I loved it.

1106
00:53:42,029 --> 00:53:44,362
I remember that feeling.

1107
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:47,819
When my husband would play,
and I would sing.

1108
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:50,430
And nothing else mattered.

1109
00:53:51,304 --> 00:53:53,359
But when we had Coco...

1110
00:53:53,388 --> 00:53:58,332
suddenly, there was something in my
life that mattered more than music.

1111
00:53:59,176 --> 00:54:01,942
I wanted to put down rules.

1112
00:54:02,298 --> 00:54:04,659
He wanted to play for the world.

1113
00:54:05,446 --> 00:54:09,298
We each made a sacrifice
to get what we wanted.

1114
00:54:09,605 --> 00:54:11,573
Now, you must make a choice.

1115
00:54:11,592 --> 00:54:14,444
But I don't wanna pick sides.

1116
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:16,451
Why can't you be on my side?

1117
00:54:16,566 --> 00:54:18,621
That's what family's
supposed to do.

1118
00:54:18,996 --> 00:54:20,636
Support you.

1119
00:54:22,413 --> 00:54:23,959
But you never will.

1120
00:54:41,848 --> 00:54:43,278

Oh, El Santo!

1123
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:48,799
I-I-I'm a big fan.

1124
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:50,624
You mind if I?

1125
00:54:55,328 --> 00:54:56,778
Gracias, Señor.

1126
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:01,272
Invitation?

1127
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:04,440
It's okay, I'm Ernesto's

You too!

1133
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,374
Hey, musician to musician,
I need a favor.

1134
00:55:26,534 --> 00:55:30,413
Oh, the competition winners.
Congratulations, chicos.

1135
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,915

1136

Oh.

1137
00:55:53,227 --> 00:55:56,454
- Hey, enjoy the party, little musico.
- Gracias.

1138
00:56:00,773 --> 00:56:01,840
Ooh.

1139
00:56:11,393 --> 00:56:13,093
Look, it's Ernesto.

00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:34,783
You must seize it.

1147
00:56:50,386 --> 00:56:52,057
We're almost there, Dante.

1148
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:57,290
Señor de la Cruz!

1149
00:56:57,568 --> 00:56:58,883
Señor de la...

1150
00:57:03,445 --> 00:57:06,325
But what can we do?
It is hopeless.

1151
00:57:06,345 --> 00:57:08,044
You must have faith, sister.

1152
00:57:08,207 --> 00:57:10,357
Oh, but Padre,
he will never listen.

1153
00:57:10,386 --> 00:57:12,490
He will listen to music.

1154
00:57:25,922 --> 00:57:28,525

Hunh!

1169
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,950
Are you all right, niÃ±o?

1170
00:58:22,976 --> 00:58:24,195
Huah!

1171
00:58:24,464 --> 00:58:26,087
It-it's you.

1172
00:58:26,144 --> 00:58:27,595
Y-you are that boy.

1173
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:29,524
The one who came from
the Land of the Living.

1174
00:58:29,543 --> 00:58:31,790
You... know about me?

1175
00:58:31,819 --> 00:58:34,190
You're all anyone
has been talking about.

1176
00:58:34,738 --> 00:58:36,495
Why have you come here?

1177
00:58:36,515 --> 00:58:38,002
I'm Miguel.

1178
00:58:38,617 --> 00:58:41,507
Your g-great-great-grandson.

1179
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,378
I have a great-great-grandson?

1180
00:58:44,407 --> 00:58:45,540
I need your blessing.

1181
00:58:45,808 --> 00:58:49,285
So I can go back home and
be a musician just like you.

1182
00:58:49,803 --> 00:58:51,618
The rest of our family...

1183
00:58:51,935 --> 00:58:53,625
they wouldn't listen.

1184
00:58:53,769 --> 00:58:56,543
But I... I hoped you would.

1185
00:58:58,291 --> 00:59:01,027
My boy, with a talent like yours...

1186
00:59:01,324 --> 00:59:03,150
how could I not listen?

1187
00:59:04,849 --> 00:59:08,094
Haha! I have a
great-great-grandson!

1188
00:59:14,604 --> 00:59:15,719
Look, it's Frida!

1189
00:59:15,748 --> 00:59:17,763
Yes, it is I, Frida Kahlo.

1190
00:59:17,782 --> 00:59:19,386
It is an honor, Señora.

1191
00:59:19,415 --> 00:59:20,817
Gracias.

1192
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:26,088
Hey, Negrete, Infante.

1193
00:59:26,107 --> 00:59:28,258
Have you met my
great-great-grandson?

1194
00:59:29,122 --> 00:59:30,409
My great-great-grandson!

1195
00:59:30,428 --> 00:59:32,723
He is alive and a musician, to boot.

1196
00:59:32,742 --> 00:59:34,768
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.

1197
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:35,920
No dimple!

1198
00:59:35,949 --> 00:59:37,447
To our friendship. Haha!

1199
00:59:37,447 --> 00:59:41,422
I'd move heaven and earth
for you, mi amigo. Salud!

1200
00:59:42,142 --> 00:59:43,553
Poison!

1201
00:59:44,196 --> 00:59:46,041
You know, I did all my own stunts.

1202
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:49,544
♪ Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me ♪

1203
00:59:51,619 --> 00:59:55,517
All of this came from my amazing
fans in the Land of the Living.

1204
00:59:56,602 --> 00:59:59,281
They leave me more offerings
than I know what to do with.

1205
01:00:00,453 --> 01:00:01,624
Hey, what's wrong?

1206
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,545
Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed.

1207
01:00:03,573 --> 01:00:05,820
N-no, It's all great.

1208
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:08,067
- But?
- It's just...

1209
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,168
I've been looking up
to you my whole life.

1210
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,752
You're the guy
who actually did it.

1211
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:17,573
But did you ever regret it?

1212
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:21,125
Choosing music
over everything else?

1213
01:00:21,557 --> 01:00:25,840
It was hard saying
goodbye to my hometown.

1214
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:27,654
Heading off on my own.

1215
01:00:27,769 --> 01:00:29,854
Leaving your family?

1216
01:00:30,036 --> 01:00:31,380
Si.

1217
01:00:31,543 --> 01:00:34,434
But I could not have
done it differently.

1218
01:00:34,693 --> 01:00:37,515
One cannot deny
who one is meant to be.

1219
01:00:37,841 --> 01:00:40,089
And you, my great-great-grandson...

1220
01:00:40,118 --> 01:00:42,442
are meant to be a musician.

1221
01:00:44,294 --> 01:00:46,974
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.

1222
01:00:47,003 --> 01:00:49,085
We cannot belong to one family.

1223
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:51,467
The world is our family!

1224
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:55,163
Ooh-hoo! Ooh!
The fireworks have begun!

1225
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:09,124
Soon, the party will move across
town for my sunrise spectacular.

1226
01:01:09,575 --> 01:01:12,226
Hunh! Miguel, you must
come to the show!

1227
01:01:12,437 --> 01:01:14,329
You will be my guest of honor.

1228
01:01:14,348 --> 01:01:16,892
- You mean it?
- Of course, my boy.

1229
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:20,396
I can't.

1230
01:01:20,416 --> 01:01:22,807
I have to get home
before sunrise.

1231
01:01:22,836 --> 01:01:25,314
Oy! I really do need to get you home.

1232
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,323
It has been an honor.

1233
01:01:31,448 --> 01:01:33,820
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.

1234
01:01:33,878 --> 01:01:35,904
I hope you die very soon.

1235
01:01:38,218 --> 01:01:39,812
You know what I mean.

1236
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,028
Miguel...

1237
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:44,814
I give you my blessing.

1238
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:46,707
We had a deal, chamaco.

1239
01:01:46,726 --> 01:01:49,163
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?

1240
01:01:50,028 --> 01:01:52,792
Oh, Frida. I thought
you couldn't make it.

1241
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,646
You said you'd take back my photo.

1242
01:01:54,723 --> 01:01:56,250
You promised, Miguel.

1243
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:57,891
You know this uh, man?

1244
01:01:58,016 --> 01:01:59,553
I just met him tonight.

1245
01:01:59,572 --> 01:02:01,502
He told me he knew you.

1246
01:02:01,944 --> 01:02:03,806
H...Héctor?

1247
01:02:03,835 --> 01:02:05,160
Please, Miguel.

1248
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,764
Put my photo up.

1249
01:02:08,387 --> 01:02:12,727
My friend. You're...
you're being forgotten.

1250
01:02:12,746 --> 01:02:13,774
And whose fault is that?

1251
01:02:13,793 --> 01:02:15,732
- Héctor, please.
- Those were my songs you took.

1252
01:02:15,751 --> 01:02:17,316
My songs that made you famous.

1253
01:02:17,336 --> 01:02:19,179
- What?
- If I'm being forgotten...

1254
01:02:19,208 --> 01:02:21,128
It's because you never told anyone
that I wrote them.

1255
01:02:21,147 --> 01:02:24,336
That's crazy. De la Cruz
wrote all his own songs.

1256
01:02:24,355 --> 01:02:25,938
You wanna tell him?
Or should I?

1257
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:28,444
Héctor, I never meant to take credit.

1258
01:02:28,473 --> 01:02:30,768
We made a great team, but...

1259
01:02:30,787 --> 01:02:34,686
you died, and... I-I only sang
your songs because

1260
01:02:34,715 --> 01:02:36,894
I wanted to keep
a part of you alive.

1261
01:02:36,923 --> 01:02:38,556
Oh, how generous!

1262
01:02:38,575 --> 01:02:40,495
You really did play together.

1263
01:02:40,563 --> 01:02:43,030
Look, I don't want to fight about it.

1264
01:02:43,049 --> 01:02:44,864
I just want you to make it right.

1265
01:02:44,883 --> 01:02:46,803
Miguel can put my photo up.

1266
01:02:46,832 --> 01:02:48,954
- Héctor.
- And I can cross over the bridge.

1267
01:02:49,078 --> 01:02:50,644
I could see my girl.

1268
01:02:50,855 --> 01:02:52,199
Ernesto.

1269
01:02:52,592 --> 01:02:53,995
Remember the night I left?

1270
01:02:54,014 --> 01:02:55,358
That was a long time ago.

1271
01:02:55,377 --> 01:02:56,607
We drank together.

1272
01:02:56,636 --> 01:02:59,592
And you told me you would move
heaven and earth for your amigo.

1273
01:02:59,823 --> 01:03:02,357
Well, I'm asking you to now.

1274
01:03:02,376 --> 01:03:04,076
Heaven and earth?

1275
01:03:04,105 --> 01:03:05,248
Like in the movie?

1276
01:03:05,276 --> 01:03:06,016
What?

1277
01:03:06,045 --> 01:03:07,630
That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

1278
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:09,809
In the de la Cruz movie,
"El Camino a Casa."

1279
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:11,403
I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.

1280
01:03:11,431 --> 01:03:13,293
No, it's in there.

1281
01:03:13,341 --> 01:03:14,399
Look!

1282
01:03:14,821 --> 01:03:16,924
This calls for a toast.

1283
01:03:16,943 --> 01:03:18,507
To our friendship! Haha!

1284
01:03:18,536 --> 01:03:20,995
I would move heaven
and earth for you, mi amigo.

1285
01:03:21,014 --> 01:03:23,789
But in the movie, Don Hidalgo
poisons the drink.

1286
01:03:23,894 --> 01:03:25,507
Salud.

1287
01:03:25,527 --> 01:03:27,179
Poison!

1288
01:03:28,879 --> 01:03:30,798
That night, Ernesto.

1289
01:03:31,105 --> 01:03:32,834
The night I left.

1290
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:35,339
We've been performing
on the road for months.

1291
01:03:35,368 --> 01:03:38,432
I got homesick
and I packed up my songs.

1292
01:03:38,739 --> 01:03:40,438
You wanna give up now?

1293
01:03:40,553 --> 01:03:42,522
When we're this close
to reaching our dream?

1294
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:44,462
This was your dream.
You'll manage.

1295
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:46,545
I can't do this
without your songs, Héctor.

1296
01:03:46,564 --> 01:03:48,052
I'm going home, Ernesto.

1297
01:03:48,081 --> 01:03:50,367
Hate me if you want.
But my mind is made up.

1298
01:03:53,228 --> 01:03:55,456
Oh, I could never hate you.

1299
01:03:55,485 --> 01:03:59,719
If you must go, then I'm...
I'm sending you off with a toast.

1300
01:04:02,561 --> 01:04:03,982
To our friendship.

1301
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:06,977
I would move heaven
and earth for you, mi amigo.

1302
01:04:07,006 --> 01:04:08,446
Salud!

1303
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:14,534
You walked me to the train station.

1304
01:04:14,573 --> 01:04:16,974
But I felt a pain in my stomach.

1305
01:04:16,993 --> 01:04:19,076
I thought it must have
been something I ate.

1306
01:04:19,095 --> 01:04:21,073
Perhaps it was that chorizo,
my friend.

1307
01:04:21,092 --> 01:04:23,742
Or something I drank.

1308
01:04:27,084 --> 01:04:28,850
I woke up dead.

1309
01:04:30,127 --> 01:04:31,472
You...

1310
01:04:31,491 --> 01:04:33,018
poisoned me!

1311
01:04:33,038 --> 01:04:35,831
You're confusing movies
with reality, Héctor.

1312
01:04:36,004 --> 01:04:39,690
All this time, I thought
it was just bad luck.

1313
01:04:40,036 --> 01:04:43,234
I never thought that you might have...

1314
01:04:43,253 --> 01:04:44,914
that you...

1315
01:04:47,775 --> 01:04:49,236
How could you?

1316
01:04:49,255 --> 01:04:49,984
Héctor!

1317
01:04:50,013 --> 01:04:51,098
Security! Security!

1318
01:04:51,462 --> 01:04:53,988
You took everything away from me!

1319
01:04:54,881 --> 01:04:56,061
You rat!

1320
01:04:56,705 --> 01:04:58,280
Have him taken care of.

1321
01:04:58,309 --> 01:05:00,114
He's not well.
-

1322
01:05:00,133 --> 01:05:01,650
I just wanted to move back home!

1323
01:05:01,669 --> 01:05:04,156
No! No!

1324
01:05:05,712 --> 01:05:06,998
I apologize.

1325
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,101
Where were we?

1326
01:05:09,312 --> 01:05:11,233
You were going
to give me your blessing.

1327
01:05:11,261 --> 01:05:13,547
Yes... ah... Si.

1328
01:05:16,101 --> 01:05:17,666
Miguel...

1329
01:05:17,695 --> 01:05:20,911
My reputation... it is...

1330
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,417
very important to me.

1331
01:05:23,446 --> 01:05:25,606
I would hate to have you think...

1332
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:29,543
That you m-murdered Héctor
for his songs?

1333
01:05:30,638 --> 01:05:32,501
You don't think that.

1334
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:33,845
Do you?

1335
01:05:33,941 --> 01:05:38,520
I... No... Everyone knows you're the...
the good guy.

1336
01:05:44,243 --> 01:05:48,018
Papá Ernesto...
my blessing?

1337
01:05:49,064 --> 01:05:50,792
Security?

1338
01:05:50,965 --> 01:05:53,884
Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

1339
01:05:53,913 --> 01:05:55,237
What?

1340
01:05:55,257 --> 01:05:56,764
But I'm your family!

1341
01:05:56,793 --> 01:05:58,791
And Héctor was my best friend.

1342
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:02,198
Success doesn't come
for free, Miguel.

1343
01:06:02,324 --> 01:06:05,693
You have to be willing
to do whatever it takes to...

1344
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:08,085
seize your moment.

1345
01:06:08,104 --> 01:06:10,197
I know you understand.

1346
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,137
No! No!

1347
01:06:14,048 --> 01:06:15,430
Let go!

1348
01:06:15,824 --> 01:06:16,937
No!

1349
01:06:17,158 --> 01:06:18,560
Aah!

1350
01:06:38,186 --> 01:06:39,568
Help!

1351
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:41,720
Can anyone hear me?

1352
01:06:42,478 --> 01:06:44,389
I wanna go home!

1353
01:07:00,087 --> 01:07:01,019
Huh?

1354
01:07:02,383 --> 01:07:03,660
H-Héctor?

1355
01:07:03,688 --> 01:07:05,675
- Kid?
- Oh, Héctor!

1356
01:07:06,376 --> 01:07:07,597
You were right.

1357
01:07:07,616 --> 01:07:09,421
I should have gone
back to my family.

1358
01:07:09,489 --> 01:07:12,416
- Hey, hey, hey.
- They told me not to be like de la Cruz.

1359
01:07:12,474 --> 01:07:14,453
- But I didn't listen.
- Hey, it's okay.

1360
01:07:14,482 --> 01:07:16,727
But I told them I didn't care
if they remembered me.

1361
01:07:16,756 --> 01:07:19,685
I didn't care if was on
the stupid ofrenda.

1362
01:07:19,781 --> 01:07:21,913
Hey, chamaco, it's okay.

1363
01:07:21,941 --> 01:07:23,113
It's okay.

1364
01:07:23,132 --> 01:07:25,437
I told them I didn't care.

1365
01:07:27,338 --> 01:07:29,969
- Huh! Oh!
- Héctor!

1366
01:07:29,988 --> 01:07:31,735
Héctor?

1367
01:07:32,331 --> 01:07:34,117
She's...

1368
01:07:34,347 --> 01:07:35,999
forgetting me.

1369
01:07:36,028 --> 01:07:37,285
Who?

1370
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,224
My daughter.

1371
01:07:40,982 --> 01:07:45,044
She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.

1372
01:07:45,523 --> 01:07:47,712
I just wanted to see her again.

1373
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:51,160
I never should have left Santa Cecilia.

1374
01:07:52,207 --> 01:07:54,251
I wish I could apologize.

1375
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:57,756
I wish I could tell her that her
Papá was trying to come home.

1376
01:07:58,025 --> 01:08:00,608
That he loved her so much.

1377
01:08:02,731 --> 01:08:04,304
My Coco.

1378
01:08:06,878 --> 01:08:08,098
Coco?

1379
01:08:22,634 --> 01:08:23,873
Where?

1380
01:08:24,103 --> 01:08:26,196
Where did you get this?

1381
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:28,625
That's my Mamá Coco.

1382
01:08:28,645 --> 01:08:30,623
That's my Mamá Imelda.

1383
01:08:30,949 --> 01:08:32,543
Is that...

1384
01:08:33,427 --> 01:08:34,569
You?

1385
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:38,976
We're...

1386
01:08:39,908 --> 01:08:41,281
- family?
- Family?

1387
01:08:53,215 --> 01:08:55,924
I always hoped I'd see her again.

1388
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:57,690
That she'd miss me.

1389
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:59,524
Maybe put up my photo.

1390
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:01,780
But it never happened.

1391
01:09:02,856 --> 01:09:04,296
You know the worst part?

1392
01:09:04,594 --> 01:09:07,436
Even if I never got to see
Coco in the living world...

1393
01:09:07,542 --> 01:09:10,153
I thought at least one day,
I'd see her here.

1394
01:09:10,307 --> 01:09:12,689
Give her the biggest hug.

1395
01:09:14,147 --> 01:09:16,701
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

1396
01:09:17,499 --> 01:09:19,629
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

1397
01:09:19,803 --> 01:09:21,551
You disappear.

1398
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:23,251
From this one.

1399
01:09:23,874 --> 01:09:25,487
You'll never get to see her.

1400
01:09:25,506 --> 01:09:27,110
Ever again.

1401
01:09:30,201 --> 01:09:31,277
You know...

1402
01:09:31,306 --> 01:09:33,121
I wrote her a song once.

1403
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:35,424
We used to sing it every night.

1404
01:09:35,453 --> 01:09:36,875
At the same time.

1405
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,593
No matter how far apart we were.

1406
01:09:40,657 --> 01:09:43,145
What I wouldn't give
to sing it to her.

1407
01:09:43,183 --> 01:09:44,115
One...

1408
01:09:44,172 --> 01:09:45,094
last...

1409
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,389

He stole your songs.

1429
01:10:54,092 --> 01:10:56,484
You should be the one
the world remembers.

1430
01:10:56,513 --> 01:10:57,683
Not de la Cruz.

1431
01:10:57,702 --> 01:11:00,036
I didn't write "Remember Me"
for the world.

1432
01:11:00,219 --> 01:11:02,110
I wrote it for Coco.

1433
01:11:03,675 --> 01:11:06,277
I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a
great-great-grandpa.

1434
01:11:06,306 --> 01:11:09,609
Are you kidding? A minute ago,
I thought I was related to a murderer.

1435
01:11:09,638 --> 01:11:11,626
You're a total upgrade.

1436
01:11:11,952 --> 01:11:13,632
My whole life...

1437
01:11:13,651 --> 01:11:15,966
there's been something
that made me different.

1438
01:11:16,014 --> 01:11:18,288
And I never knew
where it came from.

1439
01:11:18,855 --> 01:11:20,122
But now, I know.

1440
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:21,803
It comes from you!

1441
01:11:22,197 --> 01:11:24,136
I'm proud we're family.

1442
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:27,334
I'm proud to be his family!

1443
01:11:27,353 --> 01:11:30,368
Rrrr-aayy!

1444
01:11:30,684 --> 01:11:32,164
Haaa-ooei!

1445
01:11:32,212 --> 01:11:34,189
Aaah-haha-ha-aayy!

1446
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:36,753
I'm proud to be
his family!

1447
01:11:36,772 --> 01:11:39,038
Haooo-whoo-hoo!

1448
01:11:39,057 --> 01:11:42,571
Ho-ha-ay!

1449
01:11:51,174 --> 01:11:52,317
Dante?

1450
01:11:53,911 --> 01:11:55,304
Dante!

1451
01:11:58,107 --> 01:11:59,480
It's Dante!

1452
01:12:04,358 --> 01:12:05,501
Haha!

1453
01:12:10,033 --> 01:12:11,531
Imelda!

1454
01:12:11,895 --> 01:12:13,451
Héctor.

1455
01:12:13,758 --> 01:12:15,179
You look good.

1456
01:12:25,828 --> 01:12:27,037
Dante!

1457
01:12:27,066 --> 01:12:29,553
You knew he was my
Papá Héctor the whole time!

1458
01:12:29,582 --> 01:12:31,080
You are a real spirit guide.

1459
01:12:31,099 --> 01:12:33,960
Who's a good spirit guide?
You are!

1460
01:12:44,455 --> 01:12:45,588
Whoa!

1461
01:12:47,787 --> 01:12:48,825
Haha!

1462
01:12:52,597 --> 01:12:53,798
Dante!

1463
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:18,099
There they are!

1464
01:13:18,128 --> 01:13:19,943
Miguelito! Miguelito!

1465
01:13:24,302 --> 01:13:26,011
Gracias, Dios mio!

1466
01:13:40,039 --> 01:13:41,883
Mijo, I was so worried.

1467
01:13:41,912 --> 01:13:44,148
Thank goodness
we found you in time.

1468
01:13:44,869 --> 01:13:46,338
And you.

1469
01:13:46,358 --> 01:13:48,681
How many times
must I turn you away?

1470
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,670
Imelda...

1471
01:13:49,689 --> 01:13:53,040
I want nothing to do with you.
Not in life, not in death.

1472
01:13:53,069 --> 01:13:56,631
I spent decades protecting
my family from your mistakes.

1473
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:59,867
He spends five minutes with you,
and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!

1474
01:13:59,895 --> 01:14:01,547
I wasn't in there 'cause of Héctor.

1475
01:14:01,567 --> 01:14:03,468
He was in there 'cause of me.

1476
01:14:03,497 --> 01:14:06,041
He was just trying to get me home.

1477
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:07,808
I didn't wanna listen.

1478
01:14:07,827 --> 01:14:09,661
But he was right.

1479
01:14:09,805 --> 01:14:12,282
Nothing is more
important than family.

1480
01:14:13,645 --> 01:14:16,103
I'm ready to accept your blessing.

1481
01:14:16,132 --> 01:14:18,140
And your conditions.

1482
01:14:18,168 --> 01:14:20,713
But first, I need to find de la Cruz.

1483
01:14:20,732 --> 01:14:22,018
To get Héctor's photo.

1484
01:14:22,047 --> 01:14:23,939
- What?
- So he can see Coco again.

1485
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:25,735
Héctor should be on our ofrenda.

1486
01:14:25,754 --> 01:14:27,232
He's part of our family.

1487
01:14:27,261 --> 01:14:28,691
He left this family.

1488
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,305
He tried to go home to you and Coco.

1489
01:14:30,324 --> 01:14:32,272
But de la Cruz murdered him.

1490
01:14:33,108 --> 01:14:34,817
It's true, Imelda.

1491
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,940
And so what if it's true?

1492
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,186
You leave me alone
with a child to raise,

1493
01:14:39,205 --> 01:14:41,068
and I'm just supposed
to forgive you?

1494
01:14:41,164 --> 01:14:42,393
Imelda, I...

1495
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:44,333
Héctor?

1496
01:14:44,362 --> 01:14:45,437
Hunh!

1497
01:14:47,099 --> 01:14:48,817
I'm running out of time.

1498
01:14:49,547 --> 01:14:50,891
It's Coco.

1499
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:53,119
She's forgetting you.

1500
01:14:54,117 --> 01:14:56,268
You don't have to forgive him.

1501
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:59,243
But we shouldn't forget him.

1502
01:15:01,549 --> 01:15:04,016
I wanted to forget you.

1503
01:15:04,553 --> 01:15:06,513
I wanted Coco
to forget you too, but...

1504
01:15:06,542 --> 01:15:08,837
This is my fault.

1505
01:15:09,048 --> 01:15:10,775
Not yours.

1506
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:13,964
I'm sorry, Imelda.

1507
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,485
Miguel...

1508
01:15:19,571 --> 01:15:21,847
If we help you get his photo...

1509
01:15:21,895 --> 01:15:23,393
you will return home.

1510
01:15:23,412 --> 01:15:24,910
No more music.

1511
01:15:25,352 --> 01:15:28,299
Family comes first.

1512
01:15:30,172 --> 01:15:33,331
I... I can't forgive you.

1513
01:15:35,184 --> 01:15:37,219
But I will help you.

1514
01:15:38,525 --> 01:15:40,849
So how do we get to
de la Cruz?

1515
01:15:42,067 --> 01:15:44,737
I might know a way.

1516
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,177
Good luck, muchacho.

1517
01:16:34,206 --> 01:16:35,463
Gracias, Frida.

1518
01:16:39,986 --> 01:16:41,003
Ah!

1519
01:16:43,356 --> 01:16:44,393
Here, let me help you with...

1520
01:16:44,412 --> 01:16:45,536
Don't touch me.

1521
01:16:46,389 --> 01:16:47,571
Everyone clear on the plan?

1522
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,887
Find Héctor's photo.

1523
01:16:48,915 --> 01:16:49,789
Give it to Miguel.

1524
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:50,778
Send Miguel home.

1525
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:51,921
Got your petals?

1526
01:16:52,987 --> 01:16:55,003
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz.

1527
01:16:55,032 --> 01:16:56,270
- Yes?
- Ah!

1528
01:16:57,143 --> 01:16:59,017
Don't I know you?

1529
01:16:59,939 --> 01:17:02,090
That's for murdering
the love of my life!

1530
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:04,403
- Who the?
- She's talking about me.

1531
01:17:04,432 --> 01:17:05,834
I'm the love your your life?

1532
01:17:05,863 --> 01:17:07,438
I don't know,
I'm still angry at you.

1533
01:17:07,476 --> 01:17:08,964
Héctor? How did you...

1534
01:17:08,983 --> 01:17:11,086
And that's for trying
to murder my grandson!

1535
01:17:11,105 --> 01:17:13,352
- Grandson?
- She's talking about me.

1536
01:17:13,381 --> 01:17:14,619
You!

1537
01:17:14,734 --> 01:17:17,538
Wait. You're related to Héctor?

1538
01:17:17,567 --> 01:17:18,930
The photo!

1539
01:17:20,467 --> 01:17:21,830
Eh...

1540
01:17:22,532 --> 01:17:23,836
After him!

1541
01:17:25,969 --> 01:17:27,466
Security, ayuda.

1542
01:17:28,187 --> 01:17:29,627
You said love of your life?

1543
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:30,971
I don't know what I said.

1544
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,632
That's what I heard.

1545
01:17:45,048 --> 01:17:46,967
Places, Señor.
You're on in 30 seconds.

1546
01:17:54,351 --> 01:17:56,184
Miguel, I have it!

1547
01:18:04,395 --> 01:18:05,403
Oh!

1548
01:18:11,405 --> 01:18:12,451
Hurry, come on!

1549
01:18:14,726 --> 01:18:16,349
Ladies and gentleman!

1550
01:18:16,388 --> 01:18:22,140
The one. The only.
Ernesto de la Cruz!

1551
01:18:30,828 --> 01:18:32,202
Get her off the stage!

1552
01:18:40,401 --> 01:18:41,457
Sing!

1553
01:18:41,861 --> 01:18:42,927

You... still got it.

1580
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:34,998
Uh-h-hum...

1581
01:20:35,017 --> 01:20:36,487
Oh!

1582
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:41,153
Miguel, I give you my blessing...

1583
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:43,832
To go home...

1584
01:20:43,851 --> 01:20:46,434
To put up our photos...

1585
01:20:46,453 --> 01:20:48,191
And to never...

1586
01:20:48,219 --> 01:20:50,322
Never play music again.

1587
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:55,835
To never forget how much
your family loves you.

1588
01:20:58,081 --> 01:20:59,732
You're going home.

1589
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:04,879
You're not going anywhere!

1590
01:21:06,271 --> 01:21:07,587
Imelda!

1591
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,249
Stay back! Stay back!

1592
01:21:09,268 --> 01:21:11,303
All of you, stay back!

1593
01:21:11,331 --> 01:21:13,022
Not one more step.

1594
01:21:14,626 --> 01:21:15,882
Dante!

1595
01:21:17,477 --> 01:21:19,100
Ernesto, stop!

1596
01:21:20,031 --> 01:21:21,595
Leave the boy alone.

1597
01:21:21,614 --> 01:21:23,429
I've worked too hard, Héctor.

1598
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:25,562
Too hard to let him
destroy everything.

1599
01:21:25,591 --> 01:21:27,414
He's a living child, Ernesto.

1600
01:21:27,433 --> 01:21:29,057
He's a threat.

1601
01:21:29,162 --> 01:21:33,156
You think I'd let him go back to the
Land of the Living with your photo?

1602
01:21:33,185 --> 01:21:34,942
To keep your memory alive?

1603
01:21:34,971 --> 01:21:36,517
- No.
- You're a coward!

1604
01:21:36,546 --> 01:21:40,041
I am Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician of all time.

1605
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,961
Héctor's the real musician.

1606
01:21:41,989 --> 01:21:44,707
You're just the guy who
murdered him and stole his songs.

1607
01:21:44,726 --> 01:21:45,908
Murdered?

1608
01:21:45,927 --> 01:21:48,307
I am the one who's
willing to do what it takes

1609
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:50,257
to seize my moment.

1610
01:21:50,276 --> 01:21:52,197
Whatever it takes.

1611
01:21:52,351 --> 01:21:54,069
Aah! Aah!

1612
01:21:54,146 --> 01:21:55,432
No!

1613
01:21:56,873 --> 01:21:58,620
- Miguel!
- Miguel!

1614
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,375
Apologies, old friend.
But the show must go on.

1615
01:22:36,508 --> 01:22:38,083
Haha!

1616
01:22:38,265 --> 01:22:40,196
Boo! Boo!

1617
01:22:40,436 --> 01:22:42,471
Boo!

1618
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:45,669
Hahaha! Please, please,
mi familia!

1619
01:22:45,688 --> 01:22:47,003
- Murderer!
- Get off the stage!

1620
01:22:47,022 --> 01:22:49,903
Orchestra, a-one, a-two, a-one...

1621
01:22:51,976 --> 01:22:53,984

01:22:57,853 --> 01:22:59,072
Look!

1625
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:19,572
Nice kitty.

1626
01:23:21,473 --> 01:23:22,463
Ah!

1627
01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:24,958
Put me down!

1628
01:23:24,977 --> 01:23:25,977
Please!

1629
01:23:26,006 --> 01:23:27,609
I'm begging you!
Stop, stop!

1630
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:29,424
Aaah!

1631
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:33,112
Aah! Aaah!

1632
01:23:34,379 --> 01:23:36,481
Oooh!

1633
01:23:36,731 --> 01:23:38,228
Oh! No!

1634
01:23:38,286 --> 01:23:39,304
Aaah!

1635
01:23:41,368 --> 01:23:42,271
Hunh!

1636
01:23:49,214 --> 01:23:50,606
What did I miss?

1637
01:23:50,634 --> 01:23:52,247
Good boy, Dante.

1638
01:23:52,276 --> 01:23:53,639
Miguel!

1639
01:23:53,774 --> 01:23:55,061
Oh!

1640
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,501
Héctor!

1641
01:23:57,105 --> 01:23:58,766
The photo, I lost it.

1642
01:23:58,834 --> 01:24:00,447
It's okay, mijo.

1643
01:24:00,505 --> 01:24:01,773
It's...

1644
01:24:01,802 --> 01:24:03,385
Héctor!

1645
01:24:03,654 --> 01:24:05,056
Héctor?

1646
01:24:05,565 --> 01:24:06,861
Coco.

1647
01:24:07,064 --> 01:24:08,762
No, we can still find the photo.

1648
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:10,904
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.

1649
01:24:11,144 --> 01:24:13,390
No, no, no.
I can't leave you.

1650
01:24:13,409 --> 01:24:15,445
I promised I put your photo up.

1651
01:24:15,474 --> 01:24:17,654
I promised you'd see Coco.

1652
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:20,092
We're both out of time, mijo.

1653
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:22,810
No! No!

1654
01:24:22,839 --> 01:24:24,633
She can't forget you.

1655
01:24:24,653 --> 01:24:26,708
I just wanted her to know...

1656
01:24:26,967 --> 01:24:28,735
that I loved her.

1657
01:24:28,964 --> 01:24:30,299
Héctor!

1658
01:24:30,395 --> 01:24:32,661
You have our blessing, Miguel.

1659
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:35,176
No conditions.

1660
01:24:35,349 --> 01:24:38,048
No, Papá Héctor. Please!

1661
01:24:41,801 --> 01:24:42,964
No.

1662
01:24:44,203 --> 01:24:45,382
Go home.

1663
01:24:45,411 --> 01:24:48,370
I promise! I-I won't let
Coco forget you!

1664
01:25:14,784 --> 01:25:15,898
There he is!

1665
01:25:16,782 --> 01:25:18,596
Miguel! Stop!

1666
01:25:23,502 --> 01:25:24,654
Where have you been?

1667
01:25:24,673 --> 01:25:26,710
Ah! I need to see
Mamá Coco, please!

1668
01:25:26,739 --> 01:25:28,418
Huh! What are you doing with that?

1669
01:25:28,447 --> 01:25:29,484
Give it to me!

1670
01:25:29,513 --> 01:25:31,030
Miguel, stop.

1671
01:25:31,058 --> 01:25:33,449
Miguel! Miguel?

1672
01:25:33,468 --> 01:25:34,900
Miguel!

1673
01:25:35,245 --> 01:25:36,532
Mamá Coco?

1674
01:25:36,551 --> 01:25:37,771
Can you hear me?

1675
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:39,124
It's Miguel.

1676
01:25:39,383 --> 01:25:41,064
I-I saw your Papá!

1677
01:25:41,093 --> 01:25:43,503
Remember? Papá?

1678
01:25:43,859 --> 01:25:45,326
Please.

1679
01:25:45,462 --> 01:25:47,055
If you forget him.

1680
01:25:47,074 --> 01:25:48,496
He'll be gone.

1681
01:25:48,534 --> 01:25:49,955
Forever.

1682
01:25:51,174 --> 01:25:54,170
Here. This was his guitar, right?

1683
01:25:54,189 --> 01:25:56,187
He used to play it to you?

1684
01:25:58,174 --> 01:26:00,105
See, there he is.

1685
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:04,569
Papá, remember? Papá?

1686
01:26:07,334 --> 01:26:08,371
Miguel!

1687
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,434
Mamá Coco, please.
Don't forget him.

1688
01:26:16,561 --> 01:26:19,538
What are you doing
to that poor woman?

1689
01:26:19,558 --> 01:26:20,604
It's okay, mother.

1690
01:26:20,623 --> 01:26:21,870
What's gotten into you?

1691
01:26:28,035 --> 01:26:29,908
I thought I lost you, Miguel.

1692
01:26:29,927 --> 01:26:31,540
I'm sorry, Papá.

1693
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,095
We're all together now.

1694
01:26:33,115 --> 01:26:35,112
That's what matters.

1695
01:26:35,131 --> 01:26:36,668
Not all of us.

1696
01:26:36,687 --> 01:26:38,501
It's okay, Mamita.

1697
01:26:38,530 --> 01:26:42,333
Miguel, you apologize
to your Mamá Coco.

1698
01:26:45,069 --> 01:26:46,433
Mamá Coco...

1699
01:26:51,348 --> 01:26:53,269
Well, apologize.

1700
01:26:56,985 --> 01:26:58,425
Mamá Coco...

1701
01:26:58,607 --> 01:27:00,402
Your Papá...

1702
01:27:00,432 --> 01:27:02,775
He wanted you to have this.

1703
01:27:03,975 --> 01:27:05,943

What's wrong, mija?

1722

Nothing, Mamá.

1723
01:28:19,637 --> 01:28:21,836
Nothing at all.

1724
01:28:22,431 --> 01:28:26,502
My Papá used to
sing me that song.

1725
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:28,970
He loved you, Mamá Coco.

1726
01:28:29,105 --> 01:28:33,165
Your Papá loved you so much.

1727
01:28:50,584 --> 01:28:54,107
I kept his letters.

1728
01:28:54,136 --> 01:28:56,988
Poems he wrote me.

1729
01:28:57,651 --> 01:28:59,407
And...

1730
01:29:17,017 --> 01:29:20,013
Papá was a musician.

1731
01:29:20,156 --> 01:29:22,442
When I was a little girl...

1732
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:27,915
He and Mamá would sing
such beautiful songs.

1733

greatest treasures.

01:29:43,853 --> 01:29:47,454
The home of the esteemed
songwriter, Héctor Rivera.
