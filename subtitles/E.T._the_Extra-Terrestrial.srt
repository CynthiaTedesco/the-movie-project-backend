1
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,716
I think I see him!

2
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,919
This way!

3
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,757
- Five.
- Great.

4
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,479
You got an arrow right in your chest.

5
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,391
Don't worry. I got resurrection.

6
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,959
I'm already one of the undead.

7
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,837
I can still throw death spells.

8
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,638
Just trying to help you out, man.

9
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,915
How about throwing a spell over the pizza man?

10
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,911
Where's our pizza, man?

11
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,470
I'm ready as of now to play.

12
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,636
I'm ready to play now, you guys.

13
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,712
We're in the middle, Elliott.
You can't join in the middle.

14
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,119
I got him!

15
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,313
What am I asking for?

16
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,389
Mike?

17
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,391
It's not for us, it's for his mother.

18
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,555
Mike?

19
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,354
Ask Steve. He's game master.
He has absolute power.

20
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,350
Steve?

21
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,317
Steve, can I play now?

22
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,278
Go wait for the pizza first.

23
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,952
- Then I'm in?
- You're in.

24
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,998
Figure out your strategy.
You're playing after Greg.

25
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,710
Plenty of sausage and pepperonis.

26
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,030
Everything but the little fishies.

27
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,359
Harvey?

28
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,151
Harvey, is that you, boy?

29
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,473
Over here, you guys.

30
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,232
- Stop it.
- Sorry.

31
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,149
Harvey?

32
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,316
- All's you get is those 40-year-olds.
- How do you win this game?

33
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,350
- It's like life. You don't win at life.
- Money helps.

34
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,390
Mom! There's something out...

35
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,959
Where's the pizza?

36
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,793
There's something out there!
It's in the toolshed.

37
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,075
It threw the ball at me.

38
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,309
Quiet!

39
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,156
Nobody go out there.

40
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,950
Stop. Now, you guys stay right here.

41
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,156
You stay here, Mom. We'll check it out.

42
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,390
And put those knives back!

43
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,953
It's okay, Elliott.

44
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,110
Let's go get the flashlight.

45
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,711
Hold it. Wait a minute.

46
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,876
Creeps. Creepy.

47
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,996
What exactly did you see?

48
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,395
In there.

49
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,479
It's scary.

50
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,153
There's nothing in here.

51
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,639
The gate's open.

52
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,433
Look at these.

53
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,031
Coyote's come back again, Mom.

54
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,634
Okay, party's over.
Everybody, back inside now.

55
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,039
Get out. Hurry up.

56
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,348
Quick. Hurry up.

57
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,478
Tyler, give me that knife.

58
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,636
Great. Nice one, Elliott.

59
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,153
It was an accident.

60
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,753
Who said you guys could order a pizza?

61
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,193
Him.

62
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,189
- In the house.
- You geek, man.

63
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,793
Mom, it was real.

64
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,475
Douchebag.

65
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,279
No douchebag talk in my house.

66
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,278
Elliott, you're crazy.

67
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,519
Hello.

68
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,395
Hello?

69
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,396
What are you going as for Halloween?

70
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,836
- I'm not going to stupid Halloween.
- Go as a goblin.

71
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,354
Shut up.

72
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,510
It's not that we don't believe you, honey.

73
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,477
Well, it was real. I swear.

74
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,036
What are you going as, Gert?

75
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,395
I'm going as a cowgirl.

76
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,795
So what else is new?

77
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,478
- Maybe it was an iguana.
- It was no iguana.

78
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,959
Maybe a...

79
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,273
You know how they say
there are alligators in the sewers?

80
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,237
Alligators in the sewers.

81
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,671
All we're trying to say is,
maybe you imagined it.

82
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,318
I couldn't have imagined it.

83
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,359
- Maybe it was a pervert or a deformed kid.
- A deformed kid.

84
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,950
Maybe an elf or a leprechaun.

85
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,951
It was nothing like that, penis breath!

86
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,632
Elliott!

87
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,712
Sit down.

88
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,552
Dad would believe me.

89
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,757
Maybe you ought to call your father
and tell him about it.

90
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,999
I can't. He's in Mexico with Sally.

91
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,671
Where's Mexico?

92
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,314
Excuse me.

93
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,031
I'm going to kill you.

94
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,519
If you see it again, whatever it is,
don't touch it.

95
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,558
Just call me.
We'll have somebody take it away.

96
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,036
Like the dogcatcher?

97
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,951
They'll give it a lobotomy...

98
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,918
or do experiments on it or something.

99
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,830
Your turn to do the dishes.

100
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,195
- I set and cleared.
- I set and cleared.

101
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,158
- I did breakfast.
- I did breakfast.

102
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,838
What's the matter, Mom?

103
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,597
He hates Mexico.

104
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,630
Damn it! Why don't you grow up?

105
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,678
Think how other people feel for a change.

106
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,755
Ma...

107
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,829
Mom.

108
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,955
Mom.

109
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,189
Michael.

110
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,755
Michael.

111
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,989
Mom.

112
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,591
Okay, you're hot.

113
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,719
I'll be back.

114
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,755
- Mary, can I back the car out?
- Not one foot past the driveway.

115
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,113
You were outside last night
waiting for that thing, weren't you?

116
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,195
Are you going to live if I go to work?

117
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,349
Okay.

118
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,959
No TV.

119
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,354
Come on.

120
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,158
Mommy, look what Michael did.

121
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,195
This and...

122
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,556
I see them, Gert,
and when I catch him, I'll catch him.

123
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,150
Come on. Don't be afraid.

124
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,036
It's all right. Come on.

125
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,555
Come on.

126
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,513
Come on.

127
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,159
Come on.

128
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,635
Come on.

129
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,834
Come on.

130
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,432
Do you talk?

131
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,679
You know, talk?

132
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,999
Me, human.

133
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,756
Boy.

134
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,674
Elliott.

135
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,191
Elliott.

136
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,919
Elliott.

137
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,314
Coke. See, we drink it.

138
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,231
It's a drink.

139
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,311
You know, food?

140
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,515
These are toys. Little men.

141
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,796
This is Greedo.

142
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,872
And then this is Hammerhead.

143
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,634
You see, this is Walrus Man.

144
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,837
And then this is Snaggletooth.

145
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,788
And this is Lando Calrissian.

146
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,275
See?

147
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,030
And this is Boba Fett.

148
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,760
Look. They can even have wars.

149
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,516
And look. Fish.

150
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,628
The fish eat the fish food...

151
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,235
and the shark eats the fish...

152
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,716
but nobody eats a shark.

153
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,236
See, this is Pez. Candy.

154
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,118
You see, you eat it.

155
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,953
You put the candy in here...

156
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,029
and when you lift the head,
the candy comes out and you can eat it.

157
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,519
You want some?

158
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,992
This is a peanut.

159
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,439
You eat it.

160
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,069
But you can't eat this one
because this is fake.

161
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,516
This is money. You see?

162
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,594
We put the money in the peanut.

163
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,551
You see? Bank.

164
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,995
And then...

165
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,393
this is a car.

166
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,392
This is what we get around in.

167
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,431
See? A car.

168
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,479
Wait a second.

169
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,354
No. You don't eat them.

170
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,273
Are you hungry?

171
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,073
I'm hungry.

172
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,715
Stay.

173
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,555
Stay.

174
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,551
I'll be right here.

175
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,710
Okay? I'll be right here.

176
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,755
Harv!

177
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,911
Come on, Harvey.

178
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,833
He'll like this.

179
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,029
This.

180
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,076
This.

181
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,959
Are you okay?

182
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,952
Too much excitement?

183
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,154
Want a Coke?

184
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,118
35 pounds.

185
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,033
35 pounds!

186
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,713
But you're so fat.

187
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,198
I wonder how tall you are.

188
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,873
I'm 4'6", you must be around...

189
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,953
3'...

190
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,477
This is where the water comes from. See?

191
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,518
This is hot and this is cold.

192
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,592
Now, it all comes from a big water tower.

193
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,956
It goes through pipes and sometimes...

194
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,589
dead bugs come through the pipes
and land in the bath.

195
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,480
It's real sick. Anyway, look.

196
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,350
Are you thirsty?

197
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,392
I'll get it.

198
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,719
Hi. Yeah, I'm fine.

199
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,714
Sure. Yeah, I still got a fever.

200
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,118
Yeah. No, get back.

201
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,438
I'm fine, Mom. Yeah.

202
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,914
Yeah.

203
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,758
No. Mom, I have to get in bed now.

204
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,478
Okay. Goodbye.

205
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,911
Mom, I'm sick.

206
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,596
Mom, I don't need to go to the doctor!

207
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,149
Mom, I only had a fever of 99 today.

208
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,912
Okay, and a half.

209
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,557
Okay, Mom. Okay, bye.

210
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,997
I've got to throw up. Mom, please.

211
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,474
I'm gonna throw up on the phone
if you don't let me go.

212
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,511
Bye. Mom, I've got to throw up now.

213
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,749
Yeah...

214
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,715
You could drown in stuff like this.

215
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,190
Is this your idea of a good time?

216
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,389
There are so many people to see.

217
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,594
So many people you can check upon
and add to your collection.

218
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,399
But they keep you hanging on.

219
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,232
Nothing but health shit.

220
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,878
Add to your collection
but they keep you hanging on.

221
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,714
Mike, come in.

222
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,268
- How you feeling, faker?
- I'm feeling fine.

223
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,839
I got something really important...

224
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,957
Tyler said he got 69,000 on Asteroids
yesterday...

225
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,759
- But he pulled the plug.
- Look, remember the goblin?

226
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,273
You're so lame, Elliott.

227
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,396
Come on, Michael. He came back.

228
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,439
He came back?

229
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,671
He came back?

230
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,273
My God!

231
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,475
One thing.

232
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,597
I have absolute power.

233
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,915
Say it.

234
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,069
- Say it!
- What have you got? Is it the coyote?

235
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,276
No. Look...

236
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,678
Okay. Now, swear it.

237
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,513
The most excellent promise you can make.

238
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,592
Swear as my only brother on our lives.

239
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,989
Don't get so heavy. I swear.

240
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,514
Okay. Stand over there.

241
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,710
You'd better take off
your shoulder pads.

242
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,028
You might scare him.

243
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,678
And close your eyes.

244
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,079
Don't push it, Elliott.

245
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,072
I'm not coming out there
until your eyes are closed.

246
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,191
Okay. They're closed.

247
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,029
Mom is going to kill you.

248
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,276
Okay. Swear it one more time.

249
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,676
- I have absolute power.
- You have absolute power.

250
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,430
Elliott! Look what I made for you!

251
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,433
Stop!

252
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,553
Kids, I'm home!

253
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,795
Guys?

254
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,199
In the closet, fast.

255
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,430
Anybody up there, kids?

256
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,949
Anybody home?

257
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,190
Hi, honey, how are you feel...

258
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,876
What happened in here?

259
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,999
You mean my room.

260
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,913
This is no room.

261
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,393
This is an accident.

262
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,551
I was reorganizing.

263
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,233
I can see that.

264
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,875
Put those shelves back on the wall.

265
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,871
Get the toys off the floor.

266
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,110
Make your bed since you are not using it.

267
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,157
You're feeling better, I see.

268
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,391
Will you guys watch Gertie for me
while I take a shower?

269
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,875
Absolutely.

270
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,749
Bye, Mom.

271
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,389
Elliott...

272
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,911
I'm keeping him.

273
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,712
What is it?

274
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,074
He won't hurt you, Gertie.

275
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,835
He won't hurt you, Gertie.

276
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,077
We're not going to hurt you.

277
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,196
Is he a boy or a girl?

278
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,788
He's a boy.

279
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,634
Was he wearing any clothes?

280
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,949
No.

281
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,638
But, look, you can't tell.

282
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,278
Not even Mom.

283
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,554
Why not?

284
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,638
Because grownups can't see him.

285
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,313
Only little kids can see him.

286
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,118
Give me a break.

287
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,869
Well, do you know what's going
to happen if you do tell?

288
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,752
Do it, Mike. We have to.

289
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,193
No, please!

290
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,036
I'll do anything, please!

291
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,429
Help me! No, please!

292
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,549
Give it!

293
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,878
- Promise?
- Yes.

294
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,879
Do you promise?

295
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,718
What are you doing, Gert?

296
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,674
I'm going to play in Elliott's room.

297
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,796
Okay. Don't let him torture you.

298
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,598
I won't, Mary.

299
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,035
Hello?

300
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,799
Jerry!

301
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,876
Come on, come on. Hurry up.

302
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,354
Don't be pushy, pushy.

303
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,399
A plant for you.

304
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,674
Maybe he's some animal
that wasn't supposed to live.

305
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,398
Like those rabbits we saw that time.

306
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,471
- Don't be lame.
- Green, orange...

307
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,471
Could be a monkey or an orangutan.

308
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,913
A bald monkey?

309
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,878
Is he a pig? He sure eats like one.

310
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,072
You could make faces.

311
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,518
And make them mean and happy...

312
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,431
and make them get sharp teeth.

313
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,238
We are here.

314
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,235
- We're here.
- Use this.

315
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,276
You could make all sorts of things.

316
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,675
Okay. We're here.

317
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,349
We are here.

318
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,112
Where are you from?

319
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,351
I don't like his feet.

320
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,670
They're only feet, you little twerp.

321
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,399
He's trying to tell us something.

322
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,395
Earth.

323
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,239
Home.

324
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,029
Home.

325
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,989
Home.

326
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,033
What's he doing?

327
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,832
What's happening?

328
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,628
Elliott.

329
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,669
Oh, no.

330
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,639
Elliott, what is it?

331
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,676
I don't know. Something scary.

332
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,276
Got a pulse?

333
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,475
No, boss.

334
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,318
Hold it. We got it right here.

335
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,555
Follow him.

336
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,516
Okay.

337
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,912
You think it's this house?

338
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,673
Did you explain school to him?

339
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,035
How do you explain it
to higher intelligence?

340
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,588
Maybe he's not so smart.
Maybe he's a worker bee...

341
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,750
- Who pushes buttons.
- He's smart.

342
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,796
I hope we don't wake up on Mars...

343
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,759
surrounded by millions of little squashy guys.

344
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,595
Hi, Elliott.

345
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,910
- Elliott, where's your goblin?
- Shut up.

346
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,353
Did he come back?

347
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,874
Did he?

348
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,151
Yeah, he came back.

349
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,715
But he's not a goblin. He's a spaceman.

350
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,831
As in extraterrestrial.

351
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,957
Where's he from? Uranus?
Get it? Your anus?

352
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,072
- He doesn't get it.
- Get it? Your anus?

353
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,116
- He doesn't get it.
- You're so immature.

354
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,792
And you're a sine supremus.

355
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,552
- Zero charisma.
- Sine supremus.

356
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,834
Zero charisma.

357
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,115
Shut up, Greg!

358
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,191
- Sine supremus.
- Zero charisma!

359
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,475
You wimp.

360
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,988
Let's go.

361
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,795
Come on. Get in the car.
We'll be late.

362
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,830
Okay, boys and girls...

363
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,037
today we will be doing
the actual frog dissection...

364
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,190
for which we've been preparing.

365
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,071
And you will find...

366
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,232
many similarities.

367
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,555
As you get into the dissection...

368
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,915
you will discover that the anatomy...

369
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,716
The scalpel is very sharp.

370
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,478
Use discretion when you are cutting.

371
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,232
There will be very little blood.

372
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,153
There may be a few body fluids.

373
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,349
As we get started with the dissection...

374
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,277
remember that the things
you are writing down...

375
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,633
Some of the things that you should
look for during the dissection...

376
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,315
is to locate the heart
and notice that it is still beating.

377
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,793
I'm going to once more emphasize
the similarities...

378
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,155
of those things which we see...

379
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,308
Similarities with human anatomy.

380
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,999
First of all, here's the heart.

381
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,555
The intestines will be going
through their peristaltic action.

382
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,872
X-W-V-U...

383
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,469
A-F-P.

384
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,868
That is incorrect.

385
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,076
The correct spelling of nuisance...

386
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,917
is N-U-I-S-A-N-C-E.

387
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,038
They're pulling us up.

388
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,155
Class, these are the cotton balls
with the chloroform.

389
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,719
As soon as I get them all in,
put the lid on right away.

390
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,675
That's it.

391
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,160
That will start them going to sleep.

392
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,711
They won't feel anything.
They won't be hurt.

393
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,718
It'll take a little while.

394
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,078
If you don't want to watch them,
you don't have to.

395
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,028
Say hi.

396
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,599
Can you talk?

397
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,553
Can you say hi?

398
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,829
Hello.

399
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,279
Uncle Ralph!

400
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,034
It's Uncle Ralph,
long distance from California!

401
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,709
I'll talk fast.
This call must be expensive.

402
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,873
No. If I call anytime on Saturday
without an operator...

403
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,315
it's five minutes for 85 cents plus tax.

404
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,915
If I talk less, I pay less.

405
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,718
Let me talk to that little fella.

406
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,030
Lou, it's Uncle Ralph.

407
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,997
Hello, Uncle Ralph.

408
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,033
Save him.

409
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,957
Run for your life! Back to the river!
Back to the forest!

410
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,430
Run! I want to save you!

411
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,631
Let's get out of here!

412
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,949
Get out!

413
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,311
I got to let him go!

414
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,997
You've got to save him!

415
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,638
Let me handle this!

416
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,028
Let me handle this!
I can handle this.

417
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,439
Let me get this.

418
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,151
Sanford, what's wrong?

419
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,632
I'm afraid Betsy Sue
isn't going to run tomorrow.

420
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,990
No. Is it anything serious?

421
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,072
Harvey, I'm home. Come here, boy.

422
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,074
Here he is.

423
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,428
Here's who?

424
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,876
The man from the moon,
but I think you've killed him already.

425
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,838
As soon as I unload the stuff, okay?

426
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,159
Bugs.

427
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,790
I want you to meet somebody.

428
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,110
This stuff has gone up
so much in one week.

429
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,997
I want you to meet somebody.

430
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,072
When I finish putting this stuff away, okay?

431
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,668
Stupid ragù. I knew it wouldn't come out.

432
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,158
- B.
- B.

433
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,992
What's with this?

434
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,234
Hello.

435
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,873
Yeah, this is she.

436
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,829
Basket.

437
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,075
Bandit.

438
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,309
Ball.

439
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,709
Basket. Bandit. Ball.

440
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,589
Bugs.

441
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,155
Bananas.

442
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,072
Intoxicated?

443
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,070
You sure you have the right Elliott?

444
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,076
B.

445
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,150
B.

446
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,149
- Biscuits.
- B.

447
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,234
But B is for boy...

448
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,309
B.

449
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,231
...with a baseball and bat.

450
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,558
You said B.

451
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,033
B.

452
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,674
You said B.

453
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,875
Good.

454
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,199
B.

455
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,679
Good.

456
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,036
I'll be right down. Thank you.

457
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,916
Gertie, I have to go pick up Elliott.

458
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,719
- Will you be a good girl...
- Mommy, he can talk.

459
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,231
Of course he can talk.
I'll be back. Stay there.

460
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,836
Ladies and gentlemen...

461
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,229
little Grover here will demonstrate...

462
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,710
by chinning himself two times.

463
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,358
- Two times?
- Two times.

464
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,032
- Can I start?
- Go ahead.

465
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,554
Okay. Here we go.

466
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,869
Phone.

467
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,754
Phone.

468
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,836
Phone.

469
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,518
Phone.

470
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,075
You want to call somebody?

471
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,475
I am not paying for frogs.

472
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,955
Be good. Be good.

473
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,918
Stay here. Stay.

474
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,839
Don't tell anybody.

475
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,751
Nobody.

476
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,391
Be good. Be good.

477
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,550
Move.

478
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,710
God!

479
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,597
- Elliott.
- What?

480
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,069
Elliott.

481
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,589
Elliott.

482
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,435
I taught him how to talk. He can talk now.

483
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,193
Look what he brought up here all by himself.

484
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,756
What's he need this stuff for?

485
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,909
Elliott.

486
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,239
E.T. Can you say that?

487
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,958
Can you say E.T.?

488
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,753
E.T.

489
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,354
E.T.

490
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,272
E.T.

491
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,515
Be good.

492
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,716
I taught him that too.

493
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,712
You should give him his dignity.

494
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,917
This is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever seen!

495
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,788
Phone.

496
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,473
Phone?

497
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,033
He said phone?

498
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,715
He said phone?

499
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,597
Can't you understand English?

500
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,159
He said phone.

501
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,234
Home.

502
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,193
You're right. That's E.T.'s home.

503
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,235
E.T...

504
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,995
...home, phone.

505
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,989
E.T. phone home.

506
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,111
E.T. phone home.

507
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,230
He wants to call somebody.

508
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,318
- What's all this shit?
- E.T. phone home.

509
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,635
Oh, my God, he's talking now.

510
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,793
Home.

511
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,392
E.T. phone home?

512
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,996
E.T. phone home.

513
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,873
And they'll come?

514
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,598
Come.

515
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,991
Home.

516
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,312
Home.

517
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,949
- Come on. I promise, Mom.
- What book?

518
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,155
Any one you want.

519
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,389
Spiderman...

520
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,512
We'll just smile...

521
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,910
and try to get through the evening.
That's all I want to do.

522
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,159
We can't ask Cathy to trick-or-treat
in the same sheet she wore last year.

523
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,472
Now I wish I would've listened in science.

524
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,268
Think, Michael.

525
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,676
We should just grab anything
he could make a machine out of.

526
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,117
What would make a radar?

527
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,114
How the hell do I know?
You're the genius here.

528
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,555
You have absolute power, remember?

529
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,559
I found him. He belongs to me.

530
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,478
You know, Elliott...

531
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,513
- He doesn't look too good anymore.
- Don't say that! We're fine!

532
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,838
What's all this "we" stuff?

533
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,310
You say "we" all the time.

534
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,908
- Really, I think he's getting sick.
- He's fine.

535
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,833
Okay, okay. Forget I mentioned it.

536
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,073
Grab that Fuzzbuster.

537
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,313
Dad's shirt.

538
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,397
Remember when he used to take us
out to the ball games...

539
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,790
and take us to the movies,
and we had popcorn fights?

540
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,512
- We'll do that again, Elliott.
- Sure.

541
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,273
Old Spice.

542
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,759
Sea Breeze.

543
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,596
Peter says, the Redskins were defeated?

544
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,268
Wendy and the boys captured by the pirates?

545
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,874
I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her.

546
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,072
He leaps, first at his dagger...

547
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,230
then at his grindstone to sharpen it.

548
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,312
But Tink rings out a warning cry.

549
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,880
Oh, that is just my medicine.

550
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,996
She says, poisoned?

551
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,153
Who could've poisoned it?

552
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:33,518
I promised Wendy to take it and I will,
as soon as I have sharpened my dagger.

553
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,597
Tinkerbell sees its red color...

554
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,433
and remembers the red in the pirate's eye...

555
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,158
nobly swallows the draft...

556
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,549
as Peter's hand is reaching for it.

557
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,549
Why, Tink, you have drunk my medicine?

558
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,314
She flutters strangely about the room...

559
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,834
answering him with a very faint tinkle.

560
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,314
She says she thinks
she could get well again...

561
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,391
if children believed in fairies.

562
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,675
Do you believe? Say quick that you believe.

563
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,829
I do!

564
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,195
If you believe, clap your hands.

565
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,194
Many clap, some don't, a few hiss.

566
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,878
But Tink is saved. Thank you.

567
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,718
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

568
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,549
And now to rescue Wendy.

569
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,195
Can you read it to me again?

570
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,794
Peter says...

571
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,711
He's putting it together now.

572
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,839
- I told you he was smart.
- I'm worried, Elliott.

573
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,071
- He could blow up the house.
- He knows what he's doing.

574
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,435
Listen to how he's breathing.

575
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,116
It's going to work.

576
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,191
What's he feeling now?

577
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,431
He's feeling everything.

578
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,554
You're going as a ghost.
You promised.

579
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,070
I'm only pretending
I'm going as a cowgirl.

580
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,958
Okay. Now, you know the plans by heart,
don't you?

581
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,752
Meet you at the lookout.

582
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,274
At the lookout. I'm not stupid, you know.

583
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,875
You won't get four blocks
in this neighborhood dressed like that.

584
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,679
I mean it. You are not going as a hippy!

585
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,909
All the guys are!

586
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,831
I'm not stupid, you know.

587
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,314
Ready?

588
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,719
Ready.

589
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,395
- Wait, Mom. Don't look.
- Okay.

590
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,237
Okay, Mom. You can look now.

591
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,317
That's great.

592
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,593
Stay here.

593
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,432
Stop that! No! Don't!

594
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,676
It's a fake knife. It's a fake.

595
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,637
Okay.

596
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,548
All right.

597
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,078
You look great!

598
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,673
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

599
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,398
Thank you.

600
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,399
Be back one hour after sundown.
No later.

601
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,714
Bye.

602
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,397
Gertie, come here. Come on.

603
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,959
Trick or treat?

604
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,799
Trick or treat?

605
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,875
Home. Home.

606
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,679
Home.

607
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,994
Be back one hour after sunset.
No later.

608
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:04,920
I'll try as fast as I can, Mike.

609
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,991
You got to cover me.

610
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,356
Well, come on. Help me.

611
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,790
We'll be waiting for you, Elliott.
So come back for sure.

612
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,193
It's too bumpy.
We'll have to walk from here!

613
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,237
E.T.!

614
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,470
Not so high! Not so high!

615
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,113
Don't crash, please.

616
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,029
I really can't believe you did this.

617
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,072
Your father's going to hear
about this one.

618
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,999
Mexico.

619
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,958
Trick or treat?

620
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:19,993
Bull's eye.

621
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,314
Good shot.

622
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,959
Where's Elliott?

623
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,350
I'm asking you a question.

624
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:37,999
Anyways, why would Elliott go to the forest?

625
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,153
Why would he do such a thing?

626
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,919
Get in the car.

627
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,153
Get in the car, now.

628
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,911
E.T., it's working.

629
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,953
It's working!

630
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,394
Home.

631
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,999
You did it!

632
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,313
It's working!

633
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,153
Home.

634
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,393
E.T., it's working!

635
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,517
We have to go now, E.T.

636
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,078
We're so late already.

637
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,515
We have to go home now, E.T.

638
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,596
You should give them some time.

639
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,792
You could be happy here.

640
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,751
I could take care of you.

641
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:09,150
I wouldn't let anybody hurt you.

642
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,276
We could grow up together, E.T.

643
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,518
Home.

644
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,952
Home.

645
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,199
Home.

646
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,918
Home.

647
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,428
E.T.?

648
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,989
E.T.?

649
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,150
How was he dressed when last seen?

650
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,757
He was dressed as a...

651
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,233
hunchback.

652
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,079
Hunchback.

653
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,838
Is there anything to indicate
that he might have run away?

654
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,354
Any family problems or recent arguments?

655
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,353
My husband and I just separated recently...

656
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,156
and it hasn't been easy on the children,
but...

657
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,790
My father's in Mexico.

658
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,831
But run away, I...

659
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,157
Where would he have gone?

660
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,514
Elliott.

661
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,318
Oh, Elliott!

662
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,234
Don't ever do this again, Elliott!

663
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,556
Oh, my. You're so hot.

664
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,634
Run up and draw him a bath.
Quick, Gert.

665
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,277
Sorry I yelled at you.

666
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,835
Thanks very much for all your trouble.

667
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,152
Is he here?

668
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,914
- You've got to find him.
- Where is he?

669
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,358
In the forest.

670
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,718
At the bald spot.

671
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,078
You've got to find him.

672
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,949
E.T.!

673
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,669
E.T.!

674
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,879
E.T.!

675
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,148
No!

676
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:41,759
No!

677
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,275
Mom, would you come with me?

678
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,119
What is it?

679
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,918
Mary, just come with me.

680
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:18,833
Michael, what?

681
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,192
- Mom, remember the goblin?
- What are you talking about?

682
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,669
Swear the most excellent promise
you can make.

683
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,034
Michael.

684
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,833
That's terrific.

685
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,593
Mom.

686
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,798
We're sick.

687
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,156
I think we're dying.

688
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,671
- Michael.
- Mom, it's okay.

689
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:01,754
Downstairs.

690
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,116
He's not going to hurt you, Mom.

691
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:05,988
He won't hurt you.

692
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,718
Michael, get her downstairs.

693
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,438
It's the man from the moon.

694
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,431
The man from the moon!

695
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,839
You don't know him!
You don't know him!

696
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,511
We can't leave him alone.

697
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,990
This is my home!

698
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,119
Home.

699
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,069
Home.

700
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:37,434
The Collagen Unit,
report to the Blue Level immediately.

701
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,791
- Does he sleep?
- I don't know.

702
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,836
What's the matter with Elliott?

703
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,068
- Have you noticed any sweating?
- No.

704
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,194
- Has it lost hair?
- He never had any hair.

705
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,192
Are the children all right?

706
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,794
Did it build or write anything?

707
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,313
No.

708
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,830
You say it has the ability
to manipulate its own environment?

709
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,913
He's smart.
He communicates through Elliott.

710
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,630
Elliott thinks its thoughts.

711
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:40,110
No. Elliott feels his feelings.

712
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,953
We've identified
his primary carrier protein.

713
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,519
It's definitely not albumin.

714
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,478
The testing shows no deficits
on FNF and HTS testing.

715
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:55,439
EEG analysis shows complete coherence
and synchronization of brainwave activity...

716
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,794
between subjects.

717
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:07,076
There's no response at 20 per kilo.
Let's move to hypertonic saline.

718
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,312
Cut five per kilo.

719
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,150
You have no right to do this.

720
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,273
You're scaring him.

721
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,074
You're scaring him!

722
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,513
Respiratory rate 12.

723
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,273
Good air entry
but decreased tidal volume on the boy.

724
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,909
Put him on 025 liters by nasal cannula
and draw blood gas in 20 minutes.

725
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,195
Temperature's dropped
from 20 to 17 degrees.

726
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,510
Get a hypothermia blanket
and some rags.

727
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,158
Leave him alone.

728
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:38,755
Leave him alone. I can take care of him.

729
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,076
And set me up for a 2D cardiac echo.

730
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,071
Skin is cool and diaphoretic.

731
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:46,038
He's not refusing at all.
He needs anatropic support.

732
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,633
PH is down to 7.03.

733
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:51,713
He's got a metabolic acidosis.
It could be sepsis.

734
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,675
We've drawn two sets of blood cultures.

735
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:57,149
He needs broad spectrum coverage.

736
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,874
Elliott.

737
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,391
I've been to the forest.

738
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,118
He shouldn't talk now.

739
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:16,154
Well, he has to talk now, Major.

740
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,477
Elliott, that machine...

741
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,916
What does it do?

742
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,351
The communicator?

743
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,190
Is it still working?

744
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,631
It's doing something.

745
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,159
What?

746
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,791
I really shouldn't tell.

747
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,631
He came to me.

748
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,031
He came to me.

749
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,799
Elliott, he came to me too.

750
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,351
I've been wishing for this
since I was 10 years old.

751
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,156
I don't want him to die.

752
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,479
What can we do
that we're not already doing?

753
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,994
He needs to go home.

754
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,790
He's calling his people...

755
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,075
and I don't know where they are.

756
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,116
He needs to go home.

757
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:16,749
Elliott, I don't think
that he was left here intentionally.

758
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:22,359
But his being here is a miracle, Elliott.

759
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,712
It's a miracle...

760
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,553
and you did the best that anybody could do.

761
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,756
I'm glad he met you first.

762
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,075
He's got DNA.

763
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,953
- He's got DNA.
- DNA?

764
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,679
He doesn't have four nucleotides
like we do. He has six.

765
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,752
I've got de-synchronization
of the two brain wave activities.

766
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,035
E.T.!

767
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:00,430
The boy's condition is stabilizing.
Blood pressure's back up.

768
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,238
E.T.

769
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:06,078
Elliott.

770
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,557
- He's speaking.
- He's talking.

771
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,153
E.T...

772
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,313
stay with me.

773
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,274
Please.

774
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,078
Stay.

775
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,634
Together.

776
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,150
I'll be right here.

777
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,471
I'll be right here.

778
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,593
Stay...

779
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,639
Elliott.

780
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,633
Stay.

781
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,919
Stay.

782
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,879
Stay.

783
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,114
Stay.

784
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,591
The creature's pressure is bottoming out.
His complexes are slow.

785
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,238
How's the boy?

786
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,394
He's converting back to normal sinus rhythm.

787
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,992
They're separating.
Boy and creature are separating.

788
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,470
- What does that mean?
- Boy's coming back. We're losing E.T.

789
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:06,313
E.T., answer me, please.

790
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,193
Please.

791
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,828
Just relax.

792
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:16,709
No!

793
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,279
E.T., don't go!

794
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,592
- No blood pressure.
- He's got no pulse or respiration.

795
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:27,598
- We can't get a pulse or blood pressure.
- He's not breathing.

796
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:34,036
Leave him alone! You're killing him!

797
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,753
Leave him alone!

798
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,592
Let's move it!

799
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,796
Get the boy out.

800
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:43,270
Stop it! You're killing him!
You're killing him!

801
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:48,078
You're killing him! You're killing him!

802
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,797
You're killing him! He came to me!

803
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:53,438
Any pulses?

804
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,797
He came to me!

805
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,598
Minimal breath sounds.

806
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,356
Calm down. Calm.

807
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:10,997
Let's try some bretylium.
Can we have some bretylium?

808
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,199
Getting a pulse?

809
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,669
Compressed air. Compressed air's fine.

810
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,992
His pupils are fixed and dilated.

811
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,677
Defibrillate him.

812
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,435
- Everybody, stand clear.
- Clear.

813
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,158
We're losing him.

814
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,119
Quiet.

815
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,875
- It's still defib.
- Okay, let's go.

816
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,439
Let's go. Let's go.

817
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:51,994
Elliott?

818
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:54,874
Mom.

819
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,992
Let's continue CPR, please.

820
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,791
Would you people stand back?

821
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,352
Something's happening.

822
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,469
- They're going to die.
- Shut up, Greg.

823
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,391
Something is definitely happening.

824
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,232
Anybody have any ideas?

825
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,039
- EKG's flat.
- I'm going to call it.

826
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,475
- I think he's dead.
- No. I don't know.

827
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:50,154
- I'm calling it. What time do you have?
- 15:36.

828
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,470
15 hours, 36 minutes.

829
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,439
Okay.

830
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,598
Let's pack him in ice.

831
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,312
Let's leave.

832
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,916
Is he dead, Mama?

833
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,112
I think so, sweetheart.

834
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,318
Can we wish for him to come back?

835
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:12,959
Yeah.

836
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,839
I wish.

837
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,073
I wish too.

838
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:29,272
Come on, Gert.
We'll wait for Elliott in the front room.

839
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,878
Cardiac arrest was terminated
at 1500 hours and 36 minutes.

840
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:38,715
He received intravenous lidocaine...

841
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,439
intravenous epinephrine, a lidocaine drip...

842
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,354
2.7 percent sodium-chloride solution...

843
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,476
catheters from the A line.

844
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,315
The intravenous line
should be sent for culture.

845
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,994
He was monitored with a...

846
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:57,790
EEG and an EKG, he was defibrillated...

847
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:00,474
They're going to have to take him away now.

848
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,869
They'll just cut him all up.

849
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,913
Would you like
to spend some time alone with him?

850
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,677
Could we all step out for a minute,
please?

851
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,955
Look at what they've done to you.

852
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,677
I'm so sorry.

853
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,677
You must be dead...

854
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,199
because...

855
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,999
I don't know how to feel.

856
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,390
I can't feel anything anymore.

857
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,875
You've gone someplace else now.

858
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:59,149
I'll believe in you all my life.

859
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,318
Every day.

860
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,148
E.T...

861
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:12,953
I love you.

862
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,072
Oh, my God.

863
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,951
E.T. phone home.

864
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,998
Phone home.

865
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:58,513
Phone home.

866
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,636
Does this mean they're coming?

867
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,119
Yes.

868
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:07,552
E.T. phone home. E.T. phone home.

869
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:08,989
Stay.

870
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,792
Shut up.

871
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:11,915
Phone.

872
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,877
- Phone home.
- Quiet!

873
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,353
Phone! Phone!

874
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,158
Would you shut up?

875
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,435
Phone home. E.T. phone home.

876
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,159
E.T. phone home.

877
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:25,119
Phone home.

878
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:26,309
Phone home.

879
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:27,874
Elliott.

880
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:30,589
Stay.

881
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,033
Stay.

882
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:49,073
- Elliott, why don't you come with me?
- No.

883
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,477
No.

884
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,108
It's all right.

885
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,878
Would you like the flowers?

886
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,389
He's alive! He's alive!

887
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:10,270
He's glowing right here.

888
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,357
Are they gone, Mama?

889
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,994
- Who's gone, honey?
- The boys.

890
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,274
What boys?

891
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:29,798
I'm supposed to give you
this note when they're gone.

892
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:33,358
Give it to me now, Gertie.

893
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,158
Oh, my God.

894
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,671
Give me a hand with this.

895
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,590
- Where's your mask?
- Back here.

896
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,711
- Well, get it on!
- I'm trying!

897
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:13,473
Who are you?

898
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,118
I'm driving.

899
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:18,193
Open the door, son.

900
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:22,432
- There's a guy out here. What do I do?
- What are you waiting for? Let's go!

901
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:24,992
Let's get out of here!

902
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,953
I've never driven forward before!

903
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:39,676
Get the bikes. Meet us at the playground
at the top of the hill.

904
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,829
Let's do it!

905
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,399
Come on, Michael!

906
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:03,397
We'll all die, and they'll never give me
my license.

907
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:07,639
Where's the playground?

908
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:09,517
It's near the preschool!

909
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,035
- Where's that?
- I don't know streets.

910
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:14,031
Mom always drives me.

911
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,674
Son of a bitch.

912
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:44,037
- Where are you going?
- To the spaceship.

913
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:47,791
To the spaceship to the moon.

914
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:49,359
Quiet!

915
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,033
Oh, my God.

916
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,315
Stop the van!

917
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:59,878
Don't pull them off!

918
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:13,874
That did it!

919
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:03,148
Okay. He's a man from outer space...

920
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,555
and we're taking him to his spaceship.

921
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:07,870
Well, can't he just beam up?

922
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:09,916
This is reality, Greg.

923
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,312
- Keep her back!
- No!

924
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:17,234
Hold her back!

925
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:19,959
No!

926
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,439
Where are they?

927
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,358
There's nobody here.

928
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:31,993
Where are we going?

929
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,559
To the forest!

930
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,834
Follow me!

931
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,791
We got them at the bottom of the hill.

932
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,593
This is Unit 302.

933
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:30,399
We've cut the kids off
at the bottom of the hill.

934
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:56,113
Let's split up.

935
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:57,635
Okay!

936
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,033
Hang on!

937
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,433
We made it! Oh, shit!

938
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,631
Tell me when it's over!

939
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:18,759
Home.

940
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:06,438
Stop the car, Mama!

941
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:07,794
They're over there!

942
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,518
They're over there!

943
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:27,398
I just wanted to say goodbye.

944
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,797
He doesn't know goodbye.

945
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:35,349
Be good.

946
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:37,788
Yes.

947
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:05,959
Thank...

948
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,958
you.

949
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,552
You're welcome.

950
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:37,074
Come.

951
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:42,639
Stay.

952
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:12,874
I'll be...

953
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,355
right here.

954
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,949
Bye.
