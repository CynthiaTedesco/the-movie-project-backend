1
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,370
Ten...

2
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,871
...nine, eight...

3
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,957
...seven, six...

4
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,500
...five, four...

5
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,044
...three, two...

6
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,254
...one.

7
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,276
Dr. Serizawa?

8
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,904
Jerry Boyd. I'm warning you, it's a mess.

9
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,489
It's just a total mess.

10
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,241
Monarch sent me in this morning.

11
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,910
Took a look around,
but I told them we needed you.

12
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,748
They picked up a radiation pocket
out here last month.

13
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,542
They got excited, thinking
they had a uranium deposit.

14
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,420
They started stacking up
the heavy machinery and then...

15
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,922
Well, the valley floor...

16
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,259
...collapsed into a cavern below.

17
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,471
Just dropped away. Just gone.

18
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,060
Best guess right now is
about 40 miners went down with it.

19
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,986
This way.

20
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:46,326
When they first discovered this pocket,
the radiation levels were only half as strong.

21
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,788
It's almost as if contact
with the outside air...

22
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,000
...started catalyzing something.

23
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,261
Some kind of fossils, right?

24
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,682
I've been digging holes for 30 years,
I've never seen anything like it.

25
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,190
Oh, my God. Is it possible?

26
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,360
Is it him?

27
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:21,987
No.

28
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,114
This is much older.

29
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,077
Hey, guys. You gotta see this.

30
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,478
What is it?

31
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,147
Some kind of egg?

32
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,483
A dormant spore?

33
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,739
The bones are fossilized...

34
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,826
...but this formation seems to be
perfectly preserved.

35
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,330
This one looks broken.

36
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,581
It's like something...

37
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,041
...came out of it.

38
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,968
I'll get it. It's probably for me.

39
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,810
No, Takashi.

40
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,188
No. Takashi, just listen to me
for a second.

41
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,817
I'm asking for the meeting because
if I have to shut the reactor down...

42
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,570
...you're not gonna want to
read about it in a memo.

43
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,991
I've been following these tremors
since they started in the Philippines...

44
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,326
...and now they're in our own backyard.

45
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,162
No, no, no. Hayato says...

46
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,123
...I need to go through you about this.

47
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,541
Look, I'm just...

48
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:43,795
...trying to follow the protocols set forth
by the company. That's all. It's my job.

49
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,672
He's awake.

50
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,633
Oh, I know. He got up early.

51
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,801
What are we gonna do?

52
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,846
Get dressed. I'll figure it out.

53
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,599
- Okay?
- Okay.

54
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,227
Later, Dad.

55
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,521
With all due respect, Takashi, and honor...

56
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,149
...respect and honor, with all of that...

57
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,527
...I'm an engineer. I don't like
unexplained frequency patterning...

58
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:11,781
...near a plant where I'm responsible.
I need a meeting. Make it happen.

59
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,163
Bye, Mom!

60
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,709
He made you a sign.

61
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,378
What?
- Your birthday sign.

62
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,423
- He worked so hard.
- Oh, God.

63
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,635
I'm gonna come home early.

64
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,553
I'll take the car and pick him up...

65
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,764
...and we can get a proper cake. Okay?

66
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,017
Listen, I need to know...

67
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,645
...that it's not the sensors. Okay?

68
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,148
I can't be calling this meeting
and look like the American maniac.

69
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,441
So when we get there...

70
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,445
...don't even bother coming up.
Just grab a team and go down to Level 5.

71
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,738
You're not a maniac.

72
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,157
I mean, you are, just not about this.

73
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,453
Must be something we're not thinking of.

74
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,539
Happy birthday.

75
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,500
What? Is it...?

76
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,044
- Yes, it is. Ha, ha.
- Oh, I forgot all about it.

77
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,712
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

78
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,758
I should have a birthday more often. Ha, ha.

79
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,107
What is this?
Seismic anomaly.

80
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,359
This graph is minutes.

81
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,279
X is minutes, not days. This is now.

82
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,864
Wait, hold on. Seismic activity?

83
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,242
Seismic?
You're talking about earthquakes?

84
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,869
No, earthquakes are random, jagged.

85
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,872
This is consistent, increasing.

86
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,125
This is a pattern.

87
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,508
All right. Let's make this quick.

88
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,478
Takashi. What the hell is going on?
Have you seen this?

89
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,022
Yeah. Maybe not such...

90
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,815
...good time for a meeting.

91
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,569
What's the source?

92
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,821
Where's the epicenter?

93
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,366
TAKASHl:
We don't know. But it keeps getting stronger.

94
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,619
It's gotta be centered somewhere.

95
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,162
Hayato.

96
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,997
No one else is reporting it.

97
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,542
We are contacting every other plant
in the Kanto region.

98
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,252
Tokai, Fujiyama.

99
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,545
They're unaffected.

100
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,799
But my guess is these readings are just
aftershocks from the Philippine earthquake.

101
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,010
Are we at full function?

102
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,219
Yes, we are.

103
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:42,015
But perhaps we should be
drawing down, to be safe.

104
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,979
Take us offline.

105
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,356
- Now, Joe...
Do it!

106
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,940
Now. Wind it down.

107
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,196
Sandra.

108
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,656
Sandra, are you there?

109
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,496
We're turning back.

110
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,580
Let's go.

111
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,751
Oh, my God.

112
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,671
Joe, are you there?

113
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,549
Joe, there's been a breach.
We're heading back to the containment seal.

114
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,677
Listen. You need to get out of there.

115
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,012
If there's been a reactor breach,
you won't last five minutes...

116
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,430
...with or without the suits.

117
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,473
Do you hear me?

118
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,183
I hear you. We're coming!

119
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,983
I'll meet them there myself.

120
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,403
Put the safety doors on manual override.

121
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,612
TAKASHl:
I cannot do that!

122
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,031
Keep the doors open. My wife is still in there!

123
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:46,913
Come on...

124
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:47,747
...let's go!

125
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,260
Tell me this door's...

126
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,094
...on manual.

127
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,263
TAKASHl:
Yeah. But we are starting to breach!

128
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,640
I'm here.
Soon as they're through, I'll seal it.

129
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:06,891
Sandra, can you...

130
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,977
...hear me? I'm at the door.

131
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,103
Sandra?

132
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,981
Sandra, I'm waiting for you.

133
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,649
I'm at the checkpoint.

134
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,735
But you have to run as fast as you can.

135
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:17,610
I am!

136
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,242
Kenji. Kenji...

137
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,702
...we need to go!

138
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,413
TAKASHl:
Joe!

139
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,208
TAKASHl:
Close the door!

140
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,669
Seal the corridor
or the whole city will be exposed.

141
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,717
Sandra?

142
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,346
Joe? Joe, can you hear me?
- Yes.

143
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,100
- Are you there?
- Sandra, I'm here. Can you hear me?

144
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,810
Yeah.

145
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,189
Joe, it's too late. We're not coming.

146
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,274
No, don't say that! Don't you say that!

147
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,318
Run as hard as you can, honey.

148
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,821
Joe, you have to close the door.

149
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,407
You have to live for our son.

150
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,414
Joe, seal the door! Now!
- Oh, my God.

151
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,124
Five seconds! Four seconds!

152
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,403
I'm sorry.

153
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,924
Take care of Ford.

154
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,345
Be a good father.

155
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,388
I will.

156
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,265
We didn't make it.

157
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,330
Let's go out!

158
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:41,045
Hurry! Come on! Ford!

159
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,662
On your feet!

160
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,338
You got family waiting for you?

161
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,756
I hope so.

162
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,215
How long you been away?

163
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,842
Fourteen months.

164
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,010
Take it slow.

165
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,429
It's the one thing they don't train you for.

166
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,140
All right! Let's go!

167
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,894
I can't tell you.
Can I see it?

168
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,145
Don't let him see.

169
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,940
Whoa. Oh, my God.

170
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,567
It's a welcome home cake.
- Look at that.

171
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:45,777
That's you.

172
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,655
- And that's me.
What's it say?

173
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,490
"Welcome home, Daddy. "

174
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,449
Daddy's home.

175
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,618
Daddy's home.
- Cake every night.

176
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,537
- Yeah, that's not happening.
Daddy's home equals...

177
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,580
...cake every night.

178
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,959
How did you manage to get chocolate
on your eyeball?

179
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,168
- Daddy did it.
- Heh.

180
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,795
I can't sleep with you...

181
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,588
- ... making all this noise.
- Hee-hee-hee.

182
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,342
Come on, let's get you into bed.

183
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,594
Okay, big man.

184
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,055
Time to hit the rack.

185
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,434
Dad?

186
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,269
Yeah?

187
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,314
Are you still gonna be here tomorrow?

188
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,733
Yeah.

189
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,444
Come on, let's get some sleep.

190
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,534
Turns around, nose-to-nose,
he says, "At ease, lieutenant. "

191
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,172
God, I missed your laugh.

192
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,467
I missed you.

193
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,475
Mmm.

194
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,819
Mm-mm.

195
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,488
- I should get that. No, it could be work.
- Mm-mm.

196
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,158
I need to get that.
- You don't need to. Come on.

197
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,911
Hello?

198
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,290
Yeah, this is Mrs. Brody.

199
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,584
Tell him you're busy tending to
your husband's needs.

200
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,377
Shh.

201
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,213
Yeah, he's my husband.

202
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,758
Tell them we're not gonna buy it.

203
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,386
Yes, sir. Could you just hold on one moment?

204
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,096
It's the consulate.

205
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,600
Joe's been arrested in Japan.

206
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,521
Elle, I can't find my pants.

207
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,774
They're in the other drawer.

208
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,403
So why was he trespassing
in the quarantine zone?

209
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,905
Ugh. Why do you think?

210
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,324
The lone crusader for the truth.

211
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,996
All his crackpot cuckoo theories.

212
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,458
Your father is a good man.
He just needs your help right now.

213
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,960
Ford, he's lost everything.

214
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,963
Yeah, so did I. But you know what?
I got over it.

215
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,924
Right. I can see that.

216
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,680
I'm sorry. It's just...

217
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,309
Every time I let him in close,
he always tries to drag me back.

218
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,230
And I can't. I can't put our family
through that.

219
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,692
Well, he is your family.

220
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,154
Hey. Come here.

221
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,871
You know you're only gonna be gone
for a few days, right?

222
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,917
And then you are gonna
come back to me.

223
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,419
Yeah. Yeah.

224
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,425
It's not the end of the world.

225
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,365
Papa.

226
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,205
I don't get many visitors.

227
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,916
Clearly.

228
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,876
This is you here.

229
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,589
Even, uh, Ph. D.'s...

230
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,759
...don't get much teaching English
as a second language.

231
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,802
Here we go.

232
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,137
And a towel.

233
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,265
All right.

234
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,600
So...

235
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,977
...how's the bomb business?

236
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,438
It must be a growth area these days.

237
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,441
It's called "explosive ordnance disposal. "

238
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,694
My job isn't dropping bombs.

239
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,571
It's stopping them.

240
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,532
- Dad.
- Hey...

241
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,035
...how's Elle doing?

242
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,287
And Sam. Oh, my God. He must be...

243
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,164
...what? Three? Three and a half?

244
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,874
He's almost 5.

245
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,294
I thought you were over this.
"Echolocation"?

246
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,130
- Oh, hey.
- "Parasitic communication... "

247
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,676
Please don't, if you don't mind.
I have everything the way I like it.

248
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,762
I'm just...
I'm studying bioacoustics.

249
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,806
What were you doing, going back there?

250
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,892
- This trespassing stuff, that was bull.
- You broke the law.

251
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,769
I was trying to get back to our old house.

252
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,562
- In a quarantine zone.
- Precisely.

253
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,857
The new readings are exactly
like they were on that day...

254
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,484
...and I can prove it to you.

255
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,653
With a little luck, if I can get back...

256
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,113
...to the house...

257
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:26,075
...I can show you and the world this was
not from a natural disaster. This was...

258
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,326
Dad!

259
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,852
Your mom's out there, Ford.

260
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,647
To me...

261
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,816
...she'll always be there.

262
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,407
They evacuated us so quickly.

263
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,245
I don't even have a picture of her.

264
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,457
This has to stop.

265
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,962
You know I did everything I could.

266
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,297
You know that, right?

267
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,803
Let me take you home.

268
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,182
Come home with me.

269
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,102
I got a little boy who's desperate
to see his grandpa.

270
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,856
We can leave tomorrow.

271
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,768
What are you doing?

272
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,816
I'm heading back out there, Ford.

273
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,193
- No. I don't think so.
- One hour, in and out.

274
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,653
I have to go!

275
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,280
I came back here and wasted six years...

276
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,033
...staring through that barbed wire,
thinking it was...

277
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:34,787
...a military mistake or some horrible
design flaw they were covering up.

278
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,083
One day...

279
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,336
...I met a guy who runs
a cargo boat offshore.

280
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,674
Every day he goes right past
the reactor site.

281
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,885
So he places a couple frequency monitors
on buoys for me.

282
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,012
Two weeks ago...

283
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,057
I check this thing like every other day
just for the kick.

284
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,310
Two weeks ago, I'm tuning in...

285
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,355
...and, oh, my God...

286
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,482
...there it is.

287
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,903
Whatever "it" is that's in there.

288
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,865
Whatever it is they're guarding
so carefully...

289
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,243
...started talking again.

290
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,955
And I mean talking.

291
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,540
Ha, ha.

292
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,459
I have to go back...

293
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,585
...to our house.

294
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,588
I need my old disks, if they're still there.

295
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,509
I need the data to be able to prove
a baseline here...

296
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,263
...that this isn't a fantasy,
that I'm not what you think I am.

297
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,932
I'm gonna find the truth...

298
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,476
...and end this.

299
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,269
Whatever it takes.

300
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,689
Why can't you just let it rest?

301
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,360
Because I sent her down there, son.

302
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,281
This wasn't just a reactor meltdown.

303
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,741
I don't wanna hear this.

304
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,035
I know. I know you don't.

305
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,497
But you can't keep running away.

306
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,125
And, son, you can't bury this in the past.

307
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,431
What spooked them?

308
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,643
Dad, come on. Let's go.
It's only another two blocks.

309
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,275
Dad!

310
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,735
Are we going home, or what?

311
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,073
Whoa! Hey, what are you doing?

312
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,491
Dad?

313
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,160
It's clean.

314
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,997
I knew it.

315
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,418
The radiation in this place should be lethal,
but there's nothing.

316
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,711
Thank God.

317
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,076
Are they rebuilding the plant?

318
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,122
I don't know. I haven't seen...

319
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,564
Ten seconds. Ten seconds.

320
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,842
Seven-point-two seconds
and getting stronger.

321
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,552
We're trending exponentially.

322
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,429
That's our new curve.

323
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,224
Jesus, it's worse than we thought.

324
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,643
Excuse me, Dr. Serizawa?

325
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,605
Two men were just arrested
in the Q-zone.

326
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,608
We've got bigger problems here.
Have Dr. Graham take a look.

327
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,693
She did, sir. She sent me.

328
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,280
One of them says
he used to work here, doctor.

329
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,200
You are not fooling anybody...

330
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:31,036
...when you say that
what happened 15 years ago...

331
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,454
Found these disks in his bag.

332
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,373
...was a natural disaster.

333
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,041
Not sure what to make of them.

334
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,753
Not an earthquake, it wasn't a typhoon.
Okay? So stop...

335
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,089
Look, I'm tired of talking to you
about this.

336
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,340
I want my son.

337
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,802
I wanna see my son.
I wanna know that he's all right.

338
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,805
This guy, this guy knows.

339
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,515
He knows where he is.

340
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,519
I want my son.

341
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,438
And I want my bag and disks.

342
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,525
And I wanna talk to somebody
in charge, not you. No, not you.

343
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,527
I'm done talking to you.

344
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:08,323
All right? You're looking at me right now,
like I'm in a fish tank, right?

345
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,409
Fine. Because I know
what happened here.

346
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,453
And you keep telling everybody
that this place...

347
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,706
...is a death zone, but it's not.

348
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,165
You're lying.

349
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,167
Because what's really happening...

350
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,045
...is that you're hiding something
out there.

351
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,715
I'm right, aren't I?

352
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,303
My wife died here!

353
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,474
Something killed my wife.

354
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:36,643
And I have...

355
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,312
...a right to know!

356
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,607
I deserve answers!

357
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,781
All these items...

358
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:50,991
...they were found on him.

359
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,411
- And the date. Look, 15 years ago.
I thought all of the data...

360
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,663
...from that day was lost.

361
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:57,873
I guess not.

362
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,418
You see?

363
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,714
You see? There it is again.

364
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,593
That is not a transformer malfunction.

365
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,887
That is an electromagnetic pulse.

366
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,056
It affects everything electrical...

367
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,599
...for miles and miles...

368
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,601
...and it is happening again.

369
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,187
This is what caused everything
in the first place.

370
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,939
Don't you see that?

371
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,651
And it is gonna send us
back to the Stone Age.

372
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,862
You have no idea what's coming.

373
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,370
Pulses are seconds apart.

374
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,330
They're getting stronger.
It's affecting the power grid.

375
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,082
Any radiation leakage?

376
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,875
Gamma levels are still zero.

377
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,710
It sucked all three reactors dry.

378
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,224
It's done feeding.

379
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,809
What's this?

380
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,978
- It's the same pattern.
Fifteen years ago...

381
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,064
- ... it's what caused the meltdown.
An electromagnetic...

382
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,733
...pulse. That's what it's building to.
Converting all that radiation...

383
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,652
...until it hatches.

384
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,654
We have to shut down.

385
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,447
Secure the grid.

386
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:13,824
Wildfire protocols.

387
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,328
All personnel,
clear the first perimeter immediately!

388
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,968
What's going on? Hey, where you going?

389
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,698
Grid's secure.

390
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,791
Kill it.

391
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,658
All readings are flatlined.

392
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,494
Ahem.

393
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,204
Get a visual.

394
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,449
Jesus. Check the grid. Hit us
with an EMP. We're losing power!

395
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,053
Get the backup generators online.
Working on it.

396
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,680
That pulse fried every circuit.

397
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,224
- Check the cage.
Trying the backup generators.

398
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,517
Here we go.

399
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:58,905
Everybody out!

400
00:35:59,365 --> 00:35:59,990
Now!

401
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,607
Hey! Let me out! Hey!

402
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,475
No! No, wait!

403
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,309
Stop!

404
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,734
Ford!

405
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,169
Dad!

406
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:37,105
It was unlike anything
I've ever experienced before.

407
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,107
Yeah, it's, uh, Ford Brody.

408
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,276
Japan to San Francisco.

409
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,446
Okay, could I at least...
If you could let me leave you my cell...

410
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:46,698
Hello?

411
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,326
Damn it!

412
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,210
I'm sorry.

413
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,755
Hey, it's okay.

414
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,008
It's okay. Daddy's gonna be okay.

415
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,304
Daddy's gonna be okay.

416
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,436
This area is now under
Naval military jurisdiction.

417
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,104
All personnel must report...

418
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,690
...to the duty officer for debriefing.

419
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,367
Dr. Serizawa!

420
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,037
Dr. Serizawa!

421
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,039
Dr. Serizawa.

422
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,832
Captain Russell Hampton.

423
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,751
Glad to find you. I've been briefed...

424
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,753
...on your work with Operation Monarch.

425
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,839
Now, I'm told your organization
has situational awareness...

426
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,633
...of our unidentified creature?

427
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,301
Is that right?

428
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,846
We are now taking over
operational authority...

429
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,015
...from Monarch. So I'm gonna need you...

430
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,183
...to come with me.

431
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,435
Is there any other personnel you need?

432
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,983
They'll take care of you.

433
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,485
I'll be right next to you.

434
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,195
Okay.

435
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,657
Them.

436
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,637
Let's get his vitals.
Shh. Shh.

437
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:36,099
- Dad. Dad.
Radial pulse is weak. I'm counting 125.

438
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,309
It's okay.

439
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,441
You were right.

440
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,446
I'm sorry.

441
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,867
Go home to your family.

442
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,911
You keep them safe.

443
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,582
Okay?
- Okay.

444
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,169
Whatever it takes.

445
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,713
Whatever it ta...

446
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,674
Hey, stay with me.

447
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:10,925
Dad?

448
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,344
- Dad?
Radial pulse is weaker. Barely feel it.

449
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,387
We're losing him.

450
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,764
- Joe, can you hear me?
He's going into A-fib.

451
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,268
Give me another epi, one milligram,
and 40 units of vasopressin.

452
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,979
Stay with us. Come on, Joe.
Hang in there, buddy.

453
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,655
This is our needle in a haystack, people.

454
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,324
MUTO.

455
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,285
Massive unidentified terrestrial organism.

456
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,997
It is, however, no longer terrestrial.
It is airborne.

457
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,416
The world still thinks
this was an earthquake...

458
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,960
...and it would be preferable that
that remain so.

459
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,340
Before we lost sight, it was
headed east across the Pacific...

460
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,550
...and had emitted enough
EMP disruption...

461
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:55,386
...to create havoc with
our radar and satellite feeds...

462
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:59,474
...and reduce us, for the moment,
to a strictly visual pursuit.

463
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,643
I emphasize "for the moment"...

464
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,978
...because we will get on our game...

465
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,105
...and we will find this thing.

466
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,943
It is imperative that we do so.

467
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,028
Captain, I want any...

468
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:15,490
- ... and all search options on this table ASAP.
- Yes, sir.

469
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,038
Dr. Serizawa.

470
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,456
Admiral William Stenz.

471
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,169
Nice to meet you.
- Glad to have you on board.

472
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,587
Sensei.

473
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,174
Excuse me.

474
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,886
Authorities issued a statement...
Brody's dead.

475
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,638
...claiming the nuclear contamination...

476
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,850
...is at no risk of spreading,
even as the death toll rises.

477
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,582
Lieutenant Brody?

478
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,128
Dr. Serizawa.

479
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,592
My condolences.

480
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,761
We are deeply sorry for your loss,
lieutenant.

481
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,889
But I'm afraid we need your help.

482
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,853
This is the USS Nautilus.

483
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:27,854
In 1954...

484
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:32,191
...the first time a nuclear submarine
ever reached the lower depths...

485
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,403
- ... it awakened something.
The Americans...

486
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,822
...first thought that it was the Russians.

487
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,074
The Russians thought that it was them.

488
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,036
All those nuclear bomb tests
in the '50s...?

489
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:47,373
Not tests.

490
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,418
They were trying to kill it.

491
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,129
Him.

492
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,759
- An ancient alpha predator.
Millions of years...

493
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,302
...older than mankind.

494
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:00,678
From an age when the Earth...

495
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,764
...was 10 times more radioactive
than today.

496
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,643
This animal and others like it...

497
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,520
...consumed this radiation as a food source.

498
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,065
As the levels on the surface
naturally subsided...

499
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,525
...these creatures adapted
to live deeper in the oceans.

500
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,569
Further underground.

501
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,572
Absorbing radiation
from the planet's core.

502
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:23,201
The organization we work for, Monarch,
was established...

503
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,203
...in the wake of this discovery.

504
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,372
A multinational coalition...

505
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,956
...formed in secrecy...

506
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,416
...to search for him.

507
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,877
Study him.

508
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,962
Learn everything we could.

509
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:36,923
We call him...

510
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,134
...Gojira.

511
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,219
The top of...

512
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,179
...a primordial ecosystem.

513
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,350
A god, for all intents and purposes.

514
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,561
- A monster.
Fifteen years ago...

515
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:54,357
...we found a fossil of another giant animal
in the Philippines.

516
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,568
Like Gojira. But this creature...

517
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,028
...died long ago.

518
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,072
Killed by these.

519
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,907
Parasitic spores.

520
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,911
One dormant. But the other hatched.
Catalyzed when a mining company...

521
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,247
...unknowingly drilled into its tomb.

522
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:12,375
The hatchling burrowed straight for
the nearest source of radiation...

523
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:15,169
...your father's power plant in Janjira...

524
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,172
...and cocooned there for 15 years,
absorbing its radioactive fuel...

525
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:21,175
- ... to gestate, to grow.
Until it hatched...

526
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,845
...like a butterfly into the creature
you saw today.

527
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,888
Wait. You knew about this?

528
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,225
This thing? The whole time?
Why didn't you...

529
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,352
- ... kill it when you had the chance?
It was absorbing...

530
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,730
...radiation from the reactors.

531
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,106
We worried killing it...

532
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:38,276
...might release that radiation
and endanger millions.

533
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,945
That's why our mission was to contain it.

534
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:44,115
To study its biology, to understand it.

535
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,534
We knew the creature
was having an electrical effect...

536
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,828
...on everything within a close proximity.

537
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,037
What we didn't know...

538
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,623
...was that it could harness
this same power...

539
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,959
...in an EMP attack.

540
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,295
But your father did.

541
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,380
He predicted it.

542
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,507
What else did he say?

543
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,135
Please try to remember, Mr. Brody.

544
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:07,722
Anything that would help us.
Anything at all.

545
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,432
I didn't listen.

546
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,018
I just thought he was crazy.

547
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,896
He was obsessed with all this...

548
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,693
Said something about an animal call.

549
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,530
Something talking.

550
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,199
Talking?

551
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,868
He said he was studying something.

552
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,912
Echolocation.

553
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,165
If the MUTO was talking that day...

554
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:38,085
...your father must have discovered
something talking back.

555
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,671
- Check again.
- Yup.

556
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,465
Search for a response call.

557
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,342
This parasite.

558
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:48,179
It's still out there. Where's it headed?

559
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,014
The MUTO is young...

560
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,265
...growing.

561
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,101
It will be looking for food.

562
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,521
Sources of radiation.

563
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,981
We're monitoring all known sites...

564
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:00,942
...but if we don't find it soon...

565
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,944
Then what?

566
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,655
Nature has an order.

567
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,074
A power to restore balance.

568
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,411
I believe he is that power.

569
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:19,085
Sir, right now we're 50 miles from Hawaii.

570
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,587
This transport will take you there.

571
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:25,925
You're catching a commercial flight
back to San Francisco.

572
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,232
I'm gonna need you to brush your teeth.

573
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,610
- Disgusting! Those are terrible!
Ha, ha.

574
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:45,862
We gotta brush them!

575
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,905
Citizens within a 100-mile radius...

576
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,074
...are being temporarily evacuated
from the area.

577
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,787
Hey, this is Elle.
You missed me. Please leave a message.

578
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,539
Elle.

579
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,711
I don't know what they're saying
on the news.

580
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,213
There was an accident in Japan.

581
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,675
Dad's gone.

582
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,553
I'll explain when I see you.

583
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,265
I'm headed to Hawaii.
I'm gonna catch a flight from there.

584
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,350
I'll see you soon.

585
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,278
Keep scrolling.

586
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,573
Near the end. Before the EMP.

587
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,327
There.

588
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,539
Something responded.

589
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,512
Aloha, and welcome aboard.

590
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,973
The train will begin moving shortly.

591
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:59,477
For the comfort of others,
no smoking, please. Thank you.

592
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,359
Please remember to stay clear
of the automatic doors.

593
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,693
Akio!

594
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,236
Mama!

595
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:09,987
Mama!

596
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:12,823
Hey, hey, hey.

597
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:14,659
Mama!

598
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,620
I can't open it.
Look, don't worry. Just wait there.

599
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:18,579
I'll bring him back.

600
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,538
Okay?

601
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,790
Mama!
Hey, hey.

602
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,083
Mama!

603
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,128
Whoa. Hey. Whoa, kid.
Mama!

604
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,297
It's okay. I'm gonna bring him back.

605
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,467
All right. I'm gonna set you down there.

606
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,885
I'll get you back to your parents.

607
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:33,886
Okay?

608
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,930
Here. Is this what you want?

609
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,266
Take good care of him for me.

610
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:42,645
I better not miss my flight, kid.

611
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,690
Admiral, received an intel report.

612
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:49,026
We lost track of a nuclear Akula
50 nautical miles northwest of Hawaii.

613
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,569
Could be the MUTO.

614
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:57,910
Just got word of a missing Russian sub
in the North Pacific.

615
00:49:58,954 --> 00:49:59,912
Martinez?

616
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,999
Aye. Special Forces Team Sparta 1
is picking up a distress signal...

617
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,251
...northwest of Diamond Head
on the island of Oahu.

618
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,294
They're on the ground,
headed to the beacon.

619
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,463
...on 5.23 north-northeast...

620
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,008
...of the last beacon. Moving in on foot.

621
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,065
Wanna tell me why we're looking...

622
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,734
...for an Akula in the jungle?

623
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,902
Probably a glitch. Russians said they...

624
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,487
...got a ping from this location.

625
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,865
Hey, I got a reading. It's right up ahead.

626
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:40,911
Sparta 1, this is Hawkeye.

627
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:44,457
We're getting the same ping off
the transponder. Range 30 meters.

628
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,333
Looks like you're getting warm.

629
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,005
What the hell?

630
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,933
Jesus.

631
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,898
Oh, my God.

632
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,870
Guardian 3, we located your Russian sub.

633
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,623
You're not gonna believe
what else we found.

634
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:26,791
Holy shit.

635
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,717
It appears to be rising
approximately 20 to 30 meters...

636
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:37,968
...above the tree line.

637
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,804
We can't tell how wide it is.

638
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,723
Cat's out of the bag, doctor.
No more secrets.

639
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:45,142
Our highest priority now is safety.

640
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,853
There's close to a million people
on that island.

641
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:49,730
Get me eyes in the air.

642
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:53,067
We're picking up something else.
Approaching from the Pacific.

643
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,194
We need to check out that object.

644
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,612
General quarters.

645
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,615
Bridge, this is the captain.

646
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,951
- Where you going?
- Up to the flight deck.

647
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,536
I think he is coming.

648
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,954
What are you doing?

649
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,831
I have to see this.

650
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,138
Whoa.

651
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:08,225
Two Charlie Six, we are circling the target.
Go on your command.

652
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,353
Stand by, got a visual. Bogey at my 12.

653
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:23,157
Be advised. Prepare to engage target.

654
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,200
We're getting movement...

655
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,409
...down here.

656
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,456
Take cover!

657
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:38,589
Control, I have...

658
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,549
...no power. I say again, I've lost all...

659
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,103
You all right?

660
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,649
You give it 10 seconds,
lights gonna come back on.

661
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,026
It's okay.

662
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,950
What was that?
Did you see that?

663
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,624
What is it?

664
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,675
Dad!

665
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,677
Zoe?

666
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,470
Zoe!

667
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,098
Oh, my God.

668
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,894
Run. Run! Tsunami! Tsunami!

669
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,067
Target spotted offshore...

670
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,653
...two knots due east of your position.
Could be a second bogey.

671
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,004
Anybody hurt?

672
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,507
- Anyone get an eyeball on the bogey?
Where is he?

673
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,900
There you go.

674
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,360
What did I tell you?

675
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,995
...please. Thank you.

676
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:52,843
Get down!

677
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:06,857
Let's go!

678
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,245
Remember to stay...

679
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,413
...clear of the doors.

680
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,293
Go, go, go!

681
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,639
Target in sight...

682
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,226
- ... two o'clock, 300 meters.
- We're on 6-X-01. Target confirmed.

683
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,522
Jesus!

684
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,777
Can you tell us what happened?

685
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,739
...and everybody started running
and screaming.

686
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,951
Sam, please turn that TV off.

687
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,959
Hey, did you hear me?

688
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,294
Off.

689
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:56,341
Come on, Sammy. Let's go.

690
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,302
Let's go. It's bedtime.

691
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,138
- Sammy.
- Mommy, look.

692
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,181
Dinosaurs.

693
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,661
Attention, please. Incoming patients...

694
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,331
- ... please proceed...
Excuse me.

695
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:28,999
Hi. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

696
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,209
This boy's been separated from his parents.

697
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,336
Fill this out. Be with you...

698
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:33,837
...in just a minute.

699
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:36,757
Hey, you got service on that cell phone?

700
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,759
No. The pay phones don't even work.

701
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,230
Akio!
Akio!

702
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,149
Mama! Papa!

703
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:01,323
Corporal, load up, load up.

704
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,744
Sergeant. Lieutenant Brody, U.S. Navy.

705
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,372
I need your help.
I'm trying to get to the mainland.

706
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,291
It's your lucky day.
Everything not tied down is moving east.

707
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,669
- Whoa, is that where they're heading?
- Yeah.

708
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,213
I guess we're monster hunters now.

709
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,026
Satellite transfer complete.

710
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,238
Simulations uploaded.

711
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,948
Satellite tracking continues.

712
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,909
Last satellite tracks predict
the MUTO continuing due east.

713
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,453
All our models have the targets
converging on the Pacific Coast.

714
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,914
As of now, it looks like Godzilla's
still following the MUTO.

715
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,374
He's hunting.

716
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,545
Have all vessels maintain
current distance from target.

717
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:59,047
And plot the speed and heading
of these things.

718
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,883
I wanna know exactly when and where
they'll make landfall.

719
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,385
Yes, sir.

720
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,512
Doctor, what did you mean by "hunting"?

721
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,390
You think it's chasing this MUTO?

722
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,434
But if the MUTO is his prey...

723
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,185
The signal shows a call.

724
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,479
- Why call up a predator?
No, it didn't.

725
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:15,647
I think Godzilla...

726
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,149
...was only listening.

727
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:20,277
The MUTO was calling something else.

728
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,410
The pattern.

729
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,996
Focus the search on Nevada.

730
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,081
Nevada? Why would it go to Nevada?

731
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:36,001
- It can't be. It's impossible.
- What's impossible?

732
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:40,088
There was another spore, intact,
found in the Philippine mine.

733
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,340
But we vivisected it.

734
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,384
Ran every test on it for years.

735
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:47,387
You confirmed it for yourself.
It was dormant!

736
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,222
Maybe not anymore.

737
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:51,641
This spore. Where is it now, doctor?

738
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:54,644
It was highly radioactive.
It was disposed of.

739
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,271
The Americans, they took it.

740
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:58,106
Doctor, where is it?

741
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,402
Where you put all your nuclear waste.

742
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,968
Go, go, go!

743
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,144
Right, let's go! Give me a Mark I...

744
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,395
...eyeball on every vault.

745
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:42,108
Clear!

746
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:43,944
Clear!

747
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:46,988
Clear!

748
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,032
Clear!
Clear!

749
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,200
Clear!

750
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,994
Clear!
Clear!

751
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,038
Hey!

752
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,635
Is anyone in there?

753
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,870
Captain, our UAVs have footage
of the new MUTO.

754
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:18,079
Let's have a look.

755
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,331
Yes, sir.

756
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,084
This is from five minutes ago.

757
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,669
My God.

758
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:29,716
Playing all we have now.

759
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,636
It's almost 300 feet.

760
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,846
It's far bigger than the other one.

761
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,140
But this one doesn't have any wings.

762
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,101
A different sex?

763
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:42,437
A female.

764
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,650
That's who he's been talking to.

765
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,652
It must be a mating call.

766
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:51,529
The female remained dormant
until the male matured.

767
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:53,990
Now they're seeking radiation.

768
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:56,826
To reproduce.

769
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:02,666
Current tracking models indicate that
all three targets are converging here:

770
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:03,917
San Francisco Bay.

771
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:07,379
But if we rig a nuclear warhead
with a shielded timer...

772
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:08,964
...put it on a boat and send it...

773
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,173
...20 miles out...

774
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:12,217
...the radiation lures the MUTOs...

775
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:14,552
...and the MUTOs lure Godzilla.

776
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,806
And we detonate,
with minimal fallout risk to the city.

777
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:20,809
You can't be serious.
They feed on radiation.

778
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,520
Correct. That's why we use
the bomb as bait.

779
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:24,854
And kill them...

780
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:28,024
- ... with the sheer force of the blast.
This is crazy.

781
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:31,361
Doctor, if you have any other ideas,
I am all ears.

782
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:32,821
Admiral.

783
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:35,907
Yes, doctor?

784
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,994
Gojira may be the answer.

785
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:40,286
I believe...

786
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,956
...he's here to restore balance.

787
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,041
He can defeat them.

788
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,836
And what? We just stand by and watch?

789
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:51,006
I'm sorry, doctor. I can't take that risk.

790
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:54,759
Prep the warheads
and get them moving to the coast.

791
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,594
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

792
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,233
I know you don't agree with this.

793
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:14,320
But my first priority
is to safeguard our citizens.

794
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:25,915
It's stopped.

795
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,167
Yes.

796
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,461
Eight-fifteen in the morning.

797
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,839
August 6, 1945.

798
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,135
Hiroshima.

799
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,263
It was my father's.

800
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:54,319
Heads up.

801
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,529
We've got new destination, new orders.

802
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:57,697
Let's get geared up.

803
01:07:57,948 --> 01:07:58,948
Hey, tech sergeant.

804
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,200
What's the word?

805
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:03,912
Another one of those things
popped up in Nevada, sir.

806
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:34,692
Okay, everybody out.

807
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:37,070
Can't fly any further.

808
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:39,364
We're well in range of its EMP.

809
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:43,159
So from here on out, it's on the ground
or it's not at all. Let's go!

810
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:54,629
All right, listen up!

811
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,258
This train and these weapons
are headed to San Francisco.

812
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:01,010
Anyone not part of this mission,
disembark now!

813
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,224
Negative.

814
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:07,350
Can't do it, sir.

815
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:11,312
This is a high-risk mission.
That train is a national asset, not Amtrak.

816
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:12,856
- We good to go?
- Just about.

817
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:15,900
From the look of the casings
on those Minuteman ICBMs...

818
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:20,155
...guessing the digital module's been bypassed
and you're prepping for full analog retrofit.

819
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,115
Is my jaw supposed to drop?

820
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:23,825
I get it. You're EOD.

821
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:26,452
- I got my crew, they know what they're doing.
- Aim the pointy end...

822
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:28,288
...at the monsters, right, sarge?

823
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:34,169
When was the last time you let one of
your guys put their fingers in a live bomb?

824
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:36,462
Look, this is what I do.

825
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,089
This is my job.

826
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,758
Master sergeant.

827
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:46,055
My family's in the city.

828
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:50,018
Okay? I need to get on that train.

829
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:52,020
You heard the spokesman say...

830
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:55,356
...that the White House has not ruled
out the use of nuclear force.

831
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,402
Sam, your mom's gonna be right back.

832
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:02,530
Emergency, can I help you?

833
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,032
Hello?

834
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:06,868
Oh, yeah, just a sec.

835
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:08,661
Elle, for you.

836
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:11,247
- Tell them I'll be there in a minute.
- Elle.

837
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,124
It's your husband.

838
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:18,254
Hello?

839
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:19,547
Elle?

840
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:21,716
Ford?

841
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,259
Oh, God.

842
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,346
- You all right? How's Sam?
- I've been calling you everywhere.

843
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:27,639
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

844
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,059
- I've got Sam with me.
- Great. Because I wanna get you both...

845
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,769
Can't believe this is happening.

846
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:34,979
Ford.

847
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,606
You okay? Are you doing okay?

848
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:39,234
I'm okay. Elle, please don't worry.

849
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,444
Baby, I'm so scared right now.

850
01:10:41,695 --> 01:10:42,403
I know.

851
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:46,616
I'm gonna be at the hospital by sunrise.

852
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:48,785
Then I'll get you and Sam out.

853
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:50,495
Okay.

854
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,872
The military has a plan
to deal with these things.

855
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,041
I'm coming to get you both, okay?

856
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:56,542
Okay.

857
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,003
Can you please just hurry?

858
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,338
I will.

859
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:01,297
Elle?

860
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:04,550
I just wanted you to know that I love you.

861
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:09,597
I love you too. Just be safe.

862
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,184
I'll see you soon.

863
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:22,652
Good to go! Let's move out!

864
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,581
As blackouts and electrical interference...

865
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,333
...radiate farther and farther west...

866
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:41,170
...citizens within 200 miles of the creature's
current sphere of influence...

867
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,464
...are being urged to please find shelter...

868
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:46,009
...stay indoors and stay off the roads.

869
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,011
911, what's your emergency?

870
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:50,638
...kids in the car.

871
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:53,266
...debris going back about two miles.

872
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,686
This girl is not breathing.

873
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:00,940
...people that are hurt.
Send somebody out here now!

874
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:02,775
Yes, sir.

875
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:06,237
Yes, warheads are on the move.

876
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,408
I completely agree, sir.

877
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,083
All right, people. Let's go.

878
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,961
I need to know the exact location
of the MUTOs ASAP.

879
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:25,423
Aye. We're updating
our models with the current tracking data now.

880
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:26,799
Admiral.

881
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:29,552
Yes?

882
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:33,056
Please don't do this.

883
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:37,143
I understand your concerns, doctor.

884
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:39,062
But I am sacrificing lives...

885
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:42,690
...every minute trying to steer one of
these things clear of population centers...

886
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:44,567
...and now there are two more on the way.

887
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:48,488
There are millions of lives at risk.
So all I want to know...

888
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:49,739
...from you is:

889
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:52,367
Will it work and can they be killed?

890
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,786
But we tried that before.

891
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,663
We're talking dialable yield.
Megatons, not kilotons.

892
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,499
Nothing can withstand that blast.

893
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,169
Makes the bomb we tried to kill it with
in '54 look like a firecracker.

894
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:21,938
Sergeant Morales. Give me a hand.
- I thought these nukes...

895
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:24,857
- ... all detonated by remote control.
- The MUTOs knock out...

896
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,234
...everything electric.

897
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,069
Including detonators.

898
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,988
Can't even get in range
without these things going haywire.

899
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:32,407
But this?

900
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,034
This, on the other hand, is old-school.

901
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:36,411
Clockwork.

902
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:37,662
Takes a licking...

903
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:39,163
- ... keeps on ticking.
Heh.

904
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,014
Holy shit.

905
01:13:57,266 --> 01:14:00,935
Sergeant Morales, get down here
with that radio. On the double. Move, move!

906
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:10,361
Snake Eyes,
this is Bravo to November. Is the bridge...

907
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:11,654
...clear? Over.

908
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:15,908
I say again:

909
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,827
We got a train of VIP cargo...

910
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:20,788
...headed for the coast.
Is the bridge clear? Over.

911
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:23,207
Snake Eyes, I need a sitrep.

912
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,834
Are the tracks clear?

913
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:29,005
We are at phase line yellow. In the next
10 mikes, we're advancing to phase line red.

914
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:30,715
Secure or not? Over.

915
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:00,119
You think it's intact?

916
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,705
Only one way to find out.

917
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:04,457
- You wanna take the top?
- Sure.

918
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:07,251
You check below. Sergeant Morales,
you come with me.

919
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:30,525
Shit.

920
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:37,114
Jesus.

921
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,171
- Jones, you all right?
Yeah, I'm good!

922
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:13,651
The bridge is intact.

923
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,111
Bulldog, this is Eagle.

924
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:16,737
All clear to move out. Over.

925
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:18,531
Roger that, Eagle.

926
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:23,369
Let's go! Let's go, people!

927
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:28,916
Say again.

928
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:32,086
I do not have a visual.
What is your position? Over.

929
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:35,006
Unreadable. Say again. Over.

930
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,722
Hit the deck.

931
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:13,711
Help me turn it off, man.

932
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:00,591
Run!

933
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:03,844
Move it, run!

934
01:18:05,722 --> 01:18:06,931
Ford! Aah!

935
01:18:43,343 --> 01:18:44,427
He's going under!

936
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:46,762
Boats, sound the collision alarm.

937
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:48,389
Frame 180.

938
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:01,235
We're losing visual, admiral.

939
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:02,903
He's diving.

940
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:07,241
Changing course and moving fast.
I've got him at 33 knots and picking up speed.

941
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:08,868
He's gonna outrun us, sir.

942
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:08,219
Watch the swinging!

943
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:09,762
No swing!

944
01:20:10,096 --> 01:20:10,763
Hey!

945
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:15,184
Hold on!

946
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:17,019
Medic!

947
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,692
They are insisting civilians
make their way to the BART stations.

948
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:26,570
BART stations are designated shelters.

949
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,865
These patients are my responsibility.
Where are you taking them?

950
01:20:30,116 --> 01:20:32,284
Across the bridges.
Critical and children only.

951
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:36,205
Shelters are gonna fill up fast.
Trust me, they'll be safer outside the city.

952
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:38,749
- I can take Sam.
No, no, no.

953
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,750
Ford's on his way.

954
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:42,628
If you change your mind,
the buses leave in 10 minutes.

955
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:46,382
Come on. Where are you, Ford?

956
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,843
This way! Keep them moving!

957
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:52,555
Let's go. Come on, come on.

958
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:04,400
Hey! Where are they taking it?

959
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:07,236
Twenty miles offshore, convergence point.

960
01:21:07,487 --> 01:21:09,321
We're gonna lure them there.

961
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:12,157
Three birds, one stone.

962
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,183
Wait!

963
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:41,645
Okay, Sammy.

964
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,105
Laura, thank God.

965
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:46,191
Sammy, you remember Laura.
She's Mommy's work friend, right?

966
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,736
She's gonna look after you
for a little bit.

967
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:50,237
Daddy's gonna be here soon.

968
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,698
And I'm gonna just
come get you right after.

969
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:54,158
I promise.

970
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:55,451
Okay.

971
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:57,036
Okay?

972
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:02,082
Come on, sweetheart.
You're gonna come with me.

973
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:03,792
Your mom's gonna stay and help.

974
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:07,171
Elle, I'm gonna take care of him, okay?

975
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:10,090
- Say, "Bye-bye, Mommy. "
Bye, Mommy.

976
01:22:39,412 --> 01:22:40,704
I got him! I got him!

977
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,206
Just sit down here.

978
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:43,582
Sit, sit.

979
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:45,459
Here.

980
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:46,919
Did you lose consciousness?

981
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:49,463
I'm okay. Really, I'm fine.

982
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:55,552
Sitrep, please. Location of targets?

983
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,389
Male MUTO was spotted
30 miles off the Farallon Islands.

984
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,141
Showing seismic activity
to the east near Livermore.

985
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:02,893
Should be the female closing in.

986
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:03,769
Where's Godzilla?

987
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,521
Last contact was five hours ago.

988
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:09,024
Maintaining a bearing of 053 degrees,
descending below a depth of 10,000 feet.

989
01:23:09,275 --> 01:23:10,275
Be here within the hour.

990
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:13,570
Residents are trying
to get out of the city any way they can.

991
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:16,824
There's still buses on that bridge.

992
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:23,914
Come on!

993
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,794
Let's get those busses through. Let's go!

994
01:23:34,634 --> 01:23:36,218
We're not gonna stop the buses here.

995
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:37,261
What?

996
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:40,723
I can't hear you. Oh, kids...

997
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,433
...please be quiet.

998
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,830
Move into position till you have
a clean line of sight!

999
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:48,957
Portside! Two hundred meters!

1000
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:00,260
Brace!

1001
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,522
Hold your fire.

1002
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,148
Hold your fire.

1003
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:21,573
Holy shit.

1004
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:28,372
Oh, shit!

1005
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:31,041
- Hold on!
- Watch out!

1006
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:33,752
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1007
01:25:38,424 --> 01:25:39,216
Look out!

1008
01:25:39,759 --> 01:25:41,301
Get down! Get down in your seats!

1009
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:42,553
Please! Get down!

1010
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:46,348
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

1011
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:49,893
Hey!

1012
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,318
Move out! Move, move, move!

1013
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:04,575
Striker! There's civilians
on the bridge. Hold your fire!

1014
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:11,999
Open fire!

1015
01:26:29,809 --> 01:26:30,726
Move! Move!

1016
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:01,590
- All right, get in there!
- Prepare to arm the device!

1017
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:04,676
Ready! You got it?

1018
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:06,887
I'm all set.

1019
01:27:09,807 --> 01:27:10,933
Arming keys!

1020
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:17,689
Three! Two! One!

1021
01:27:28,534 --> 01:27:29,785
What the hell was that?

1022
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:30,953
EMP.

1023
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:33,330
Engine's stopped! We lost power!

1024
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:17,082
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1025
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,714
- Fire!
- Incoming!

1026
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:04,106
Sam Brody was checked into the Oakland
Coliseum shelter an hour ago. He is safe.

1027
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:06,942
No record of Elle Brody.
Never made it out of the city.

1028
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:11,196
Well, check again. Please.
I told her to wait for me, and I didn't make it.

1029
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:14,408
They are trying to get everyone downtown
into subway shelters.

1030
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:16,326
I'm sure your wife is fine.

1031
01:30:19,872 --> 01:30:20,872
Lieutenant Brody!

1032
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:23,125
I'm looking for Lieutenant Brody.

1033
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,794
- Are you Brody?
- Yes.

1034
01:30:26,045 --> 01:30:29,047
Okay. The male delivered the warhead
to the center of downtown.

1035
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:32,676
That puts 100,000 civilians
in the blast radius.

1036
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:33,844
We can't stop it remotely.

1037
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:38,098
An analog timer has been installed. The MUTOs
are frying electronics within a five-mile bubble.

1038
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:40,058
Means approaching from ground
is not an option.

1039
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:43,228
That's why we'll be conducting
a HALO insertion. Jumping altitude...

1040
01:30:43,479 --> 01:30:44,896
...will be 30,000 feet.

1041
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:47,607
We just skate to the top and drop. Here.

1042
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:51,695
And here. If you don't hit a skyscraper
on the way, meet at rally point Charlie.

1043
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:54,614
- Right here. Good?
- Doctor, any guesses where to look?

1044
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:56,074
Underground.

1045
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:58,076
If the MUTOs have spawned...

1046
01:30:58,327 --> 01:30:59,911
...they'll be building a nest.

1047
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:03,790
Captain, when you find the warhead...

1048
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:05,917
- ... how long to disarm it?
- Without seeing...

1049
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:09,087
- ... the analog mod, I couldn't even guess.
Sixty seconds...

1050
01:31:09,338 --> 01:31:10,755
...if I can access it.

1051
01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:12,757
I retrofitted that device myself.

1052
01:31:13,217 --> 01:31:14,676
Lieutenant Brody is our only...

1053
01:31:14,927 --> 01:31:16,970
...EOD tech to survive the train attack.

1054
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:19,097
Well, it sounds like we could use you.

1055
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:20,474
With all due respect...

1056
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:24,644
- ... if that doesn't work, then what's Plan B?
- The waterfront...

1057
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:26,771
...is located one klick downhill.

1058
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:28,982
Get the bomb to the pier, onto a boat...

1059
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:32,277
...and as far away from the city
as possible before it detonates.

1060
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:37,407
Any questions?

1061
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:39,409
- Dismissed.
- That's it.

1062
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:40,660
Let's move.

1063
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:42,204
Lieutenant?

1064
01:31:43,539 --> 01:31:45,248
They've already been briefed.

1065
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,167
We have no extraction plan.

1066
01:31:47,418 --> 01:31:50,629
If you don't walk out,
you don't come back at all.

1067
01:31:51,547 --> 01:31:53,423
Sir, I'll do whatever it takes.

1068
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:14,277
This alpha predator of yours, doctor...

1069
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,906
...do you really think he has a chance?

1070
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:24,162
The arrogance of man is thinking
nature is in our control...

1071
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:26,498
...and not the other way around.

1072
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:32,837
Let them fight.

1073
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:28,977
Oh, Lord God, we give thanks...

1074
01:33:29,228 --> 01:33:31,104
...for the opportunities you have given us...

1075
01:33:31,355 --> 01:33:34,232
...going together as comrades
to defend our great nation.

1076
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:37,736
We thank you for the time and service
that you have given us together.

1077
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:39,988
Now as we are about to leave one another...

1078
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:42,157
...let us have the strength...

1079
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:31,451
Take position! Take position!

1080
01:36:33,704 --> 01:36:35,121
I saw Team 1 move to the east.

1081
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:39,626
Two of our team members didn't make it.
I heard bits and pieces on the radio.

1082
01:36:39,877 --> 01:36:41,544
Snipers on the rooftop
moving into position.

1083
01:36:42,004 --> 01:36:43,505
Here we go. Picking up the nuke.

1084
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:44,339
Which way?

1085
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:45,757
One klick up the hill.

1086
01:36:46,008 --> 01:36:46,925
We found the warhead.

1087
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:49,302
Let's go! Up the hill, this direction. Move.

1088
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:14,911
Hey. Hey.

1089
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:16,454
Look.

1090
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:29,986
Let's move, let's move.

1091
01:38:30,237 --> 01:38:31,404
On my six.

1092
01:38:58,307 --> 01:39:00,808
Sarge, get a look at this.

1093
01:39:03,979 --> 01:39:06,064
We gotta get moving.
You got a signal yet?

1094
01:39:06,315 --> 01:39:07,273
I got it.

1095
01:39:09,526 --> 01:39:10,360
It's down there.

1096
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:20,328
All right, move, move!

1097
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:30,421
Grab a line!

1098
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:36,469
More light. Grazer.

1099
01:40:00,703 --> 01:40:01,494
Right, clear out.

1100
01:40:01,745 --> 01:40:02,578
Here we go.

1101
01:40:03,455 --> 01:40:04,622
Whoa, look out, heads up!

1102
01:40:05,457 --> 01:40:06,499
How much time we got left?

1103
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:10,920
We have 27 mikes.

1104
01:40:11,588 --> 01:40:13,381
We gotta get this thing down.

1105
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:44,287
Move, move, I got you!

1106
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:45,705
Move it out, move it out!

1107
01:41:19,948 --> 01:41:21,532
Careful! Careful.

1108
01:41:21,784 --> 01:41:23,284
And down in three...

1109
01:41:23,535 --> 01:41:24,077
...two...

1110
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:25,369
...one.

1111
01:41:25,704 --> 01:41:26,871
Let's get this cover off.

1112
01:41:27,122 --> 01:41:27,955
Lieutenant, you're up.

1113
01:41:32,795 --> 01:41:35,296
It's not budging. It's sealed shut.

1114
01:41:35,547 --> 01:41:36,464
We need time to open it.

1115
01:41:36,715 --> 01:41:37,590
We don't have time!

1116
01:41:37,841 --> 01:41:39,175
We gotta get it on a boat.

1117
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:41,010
Grab the warhead! Let's move!

1118
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:42,220
Go!

1119
01:41:43,847 --> 01:41:44,555
Easy.

1120
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,058
Easy, easy.

1121
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:49,894
Move it out, guys!

1122
01:41:54,274 --> 01:41:55,817
Lieutenant, let's go!

1123
01:42:35,023 --> 01:42:36,232
Lieutenant?

1124
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:32,515
What the hell was that?

1125
01:44:32,766 --> 01:44:34,183
Holy shit! Did you see that?

1126
01:44:55,497 --> 01:44:56,580
This way.

1127
01:44:59,042 --> 01:45:00,376
Faster, faster.

1128
01:45:02,462 --> 01:45:04,005
Let's get this thing started.

1129
01:45:06,216 --> 01:45:07,300
Find the ignition, sir?

1130
01:45:07,676 --> 01:45:09,051
Give me that pack.

1131
01:45:09,469 --> 01:45:10,678
Here you go.

1132
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:14,390
Come on, come on. Hurry.

1133
01:45:40,709 --> 01:45:42,585
Hurry it up. Let's go, let's go!

1134
01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:45,463
She's coming for the bomb!

1135
01:45:48,759 --> 01:45:50,843
Let's get this weapon secured.

1136
01:48:36,009 --> 01:48:38,302
Unh! Come on.

1137
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:39,970
Come on.

1138
01:53:02,984 --> 01:53:04,443
Stay right here.

1139
01:53:10,408 --> 01:53:11,492
Quiet!

1140
01:53:11,993 --> 01:53:13,035
Quiet!

1141
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:15,913
I hear some people. Come on!

1142
01:53:17,207 --> 01:53:20,083
This one's in bad shape.
Come on, grab my hand. We got you.

1143
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:22,044
Help him up. Help him up.

1144
