1
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:17,321
M doesn't mind you earning
a little money on the side, Dryden.

2
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,193
She'd just prefer it
if it wasn't selling secrets.

3
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:32,400
If the theatrics
are supposed to scare me...

4
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:35,099
...you have the wrong man, Bond.

5
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,670
If M was so sure that I was bent...

6
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,815
...she'd have sent a double-0.

7
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:44,218
Benefits of being section chief...

8
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,082
...l'd know if anyone had been
promoted to double-0 status...

9
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,587
...wouldn't I?

10
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:54,186
-Your file shows no kills, and it takes--
-Two.

11
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,144
Shame.

12
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:15,814
We barely got to know each other.

14
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:21,047
I know where you keep your gun.

15
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,084
I suppose that's something.

16
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:28,454
True.

17
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:30,697
How did he die?

18
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,367
Your contact?

19
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,058
Not well.

20
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:21,009
Made you feel it, did he?

21
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:26,250
Well...

22
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,682
...you needn't worry.

23
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:30,817
The second is--

24
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,628
Yes.

25
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,490
Considerably.

26
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:36,904
So how do I trust this man
that I've never met with my money?

27
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:39,673
You asked for the introduction.

28
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,105
That's all my organization
will guarantee.

29
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:25,181
I suppose our friend
Mr. White will have told you...

30
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:27,651
...that I have provided
reliable banking services...

31
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:30,553
...for many other
freedom fighters over the years.

32
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:37,629
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?

33
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,460
No.

34
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:42,330
I believe in
a reasonable rate of return.

35
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:44,802
I want no risk in the portfolio.

36
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,269
Agreed.

37
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,272
And I can access it
anywhere in the world?

38
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:49,669
Yes.

39
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,858
I have the money,
so short another million shares...

40
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,727
<i>...of Skyfleet stock.</i>

41
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:16,803
Sir, you must know you're betting
against the market.

42
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:20,169
No one expects this stock
to go anywhere but up.

43
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:23,072
Just do it.

44
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,315
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.

45
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:05,513
I wonder if bomb-makers
are insured for things like that.

46
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,768
He's on the move.

47
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:24,872
He's on the move,
and he's heading straight for me.

48
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,767
Stop touching your ear.

49
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:30,036
-Sorry?
-Put your hand down.

50
00:10:36,518 --> 00:10:39,009
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.

51
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:13,159
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct...

52
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:14,760
...my dear general.

53
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,992
Nothing sinister.

54
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,635
All in.

55
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,567
I have two pair, and you have
a 17.4 percent chance...

56
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:31,871
...of making your straight.

57
00:20:58,306 --> 00:21:00,638
When does Ellipsis expire?

58
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:04,005
-We have less than 36 hours. I can--
-No. No, no.

59
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:06,942
That's all the time I have anyway.

60
00:21:08,683 --> 00:21:10,878
Give our guests
five minutes to leave...

61
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:13,384
...or throw them overboard.

62
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,696
Who the hell do they think they are?

63
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:29,393
I report to the prime minister,
even he's smart enough...

64
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:30,798
...not to ask me what we do.

65
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:34,703
Have you ever seen such a bunch
of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

66
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,708
They don't care what we do, they care
what we get photographed doing.

67
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:40,573
And how the hell
could Bond be so stupid?

68
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:43,649
I give him double-0 status,
he celebrates by shooting an embassy.

69
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:46,252
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?

70
00:21:46,454 --> 00:21:48,979
In the old days, if an agent
did something embarrassing...

71
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,817
...he'd have the good sense
to defect.

72
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:52,857
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

73
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,132
You've got a bloody cheek.

74
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:12,829
Sorry.

75
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,838
I'll shoot the camera first next time.

76
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:16,704
Or yourself.

77
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:18,936
You stormed into an embassy.

78
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,672
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule...

79
00:23:21,883 --> 00:23:23,475
...of international relationships.

80
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:25,619
And why?
So you could kill a nobody.

81
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,515
We wanted to question him,
not kill him.

82
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,925
For God's sake. You're supposed
to display some kind of judgment.

83
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:33,185
I did.

84
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:36,387
I thought one less bomb-maker
in the world would be good.

85
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:38,395
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

86
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:42,425
We're trying to find out how an entire
network of terrorist groups is financed...

87
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:44,127
...and you give us one bomb-maker.

88
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,466
Hardly the big picture,
wouldn't you say?

89
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,906
The man isn't even a true believer.
He's a gun for hire.

90
00:23:50,111 --> 00:23:51,942
And thanks to your trigger finger...

91
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:55,014
...we have no idea
who hired him or why.

92
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:57,548
And how the hell
did you find out where I lived?

93
00:23:57,752 --> 00:23:59,344
The same way
I found out your name.

94
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:02,489
I thought "M" was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for--

95
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,159
Utter one more syllable
and I'll have you killed.

96
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:09,357
I knew it was too early
to promote you.

97
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:13,834
Well, I understand double-0s
have a very short life-expectancy...

98
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,230
...so your mistake will be short-lived.

99
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:27,380
Bond, this may be too much
for a blunt instrument to understand...

100
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:30,949
...but arrogance and self-awareness
seldom go hand in hand.

101
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:34,282
So you want me to be half monk,
half hit-man?

102
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:36,354
Any thug can kill.

103
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,958
I want you to take your ego
out of the equation...

104
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,685
...and to judge the situation
dispassionately.

105
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,658
I have to know I can trust you,
and that you know who to trust.

106
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:50,495
And since I don't know that,
I need you out of my sight.

107
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:52,730
Go and stick your head
in the sand somewhere...

108
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:54,306
...and think about your future.

109
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:57,410
Because these bastards
want your head.

110
00:24:57,612 --> 00:25:01,070
And I'm seriously considering
feeding you to them.

111
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,414
And Bond...

112
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:16,422
...don't ever break into
my house again.

113
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:19,298
Ma'am.

114
00:26:32,006 --> 00:26:34,839
Good day, sir,
and welcome to the Ocean Club.

115
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,078
Hey. Hey.

116
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:55,889
Hello.

117
00:26:56,097 --> 00:26:58,224
Are you going to take this
or make me wait?

118
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:01,735
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

119
00:27:45,146 --> 00:27:48,081
<i>Security to car park.
Security to car park.</i>

120
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:49,978
Absolutely incredible.

121
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,574
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?

122
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:35,222
Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment
thing, and I haven't got a reservation.

123
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:36,822
Okay.

124
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:41,693
-We have an ocean-view villa.
-Perfect.

125
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:47,064
Could you do me a favor?
I was here last night...

126
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:51,227
...and I parked my car next to
a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

127
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:53,532
I nicked the door.
You wouldn't happen to know--?

128
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:56,175
-Mr. Dimitrios.
-Right.

129
00:29:56,811 --> 00:29:59,109
If he hasn't noticed,
I'm not sure I'd mention it.

130
00:29:59,313 --> 00:30:01,008
Isn't the type
to take bad news well.

131
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,852
But if I felt compelled to find him?

132
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:08,114
He has a house just up the beach.

133
00:30:09,757 --> 00:30:11,054
Thank you.

134
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:14,849
-What?
-He's in the Bahamas.

135
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:17,490
You woke me
to share his holiday plans?

136
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:19,660
Well, he's logged into
our secure website...

137
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:21,920
...using your name and password.

138
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,997
Well, how the hell
does he know these things?

139
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:27,565
<i>Well, I'm doing my best to find out.</i>

140
00:31:27,768 --> 00:31:31,636
<i>-Who's he looking at?
-Alex Dimitrios.</i>

141
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,666
That slimy bugger.

142
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:46,152
Now known associates....

143
00:31:57,865 --> 00:31:59,298
Le Chiffre.

144
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:18,378
We've had a good night,
we've had a few drinks.

145
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,049
How can I assist you, sir?

146
00:32:21,255 --> 00:32:23,485
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

147
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:26,326
-Look what just happened.
-Good job, big boy.

148
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,755
Yeah.

149
00:32:35,636 --> 00:32:36,603
Do you mind if I join?

150
00:32:36,804 --> 00:32:39,034
-Oh, good evening. How are you?
-Good evening.

151
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:52,619
Small blind, big blind.

152
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,481
I'm in.

153
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,586
Bet's to you.

154
00:33:01,262 --> 00:33:04,026
If that was for luck,
you're two hours late.

155
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:07,863
Two hundred to you.

156
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,002
Bet's to you.

157
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:15,698
I heard you.

158
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:18,107
Five to call.

159
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:23,013
-Action's to you.
-Pair of sevens.

160
00:33:23,217 --> 00:33:24,582
Ace high.

161
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,721
Check or bet.

162
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,412
-Check.
-And to you.

163
00:33:29,624 --> 00:33:31,558
Five thousand.

164
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,961
Five to call.

165
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:51,175
-Check.
-Check to you, sir.

166
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,174
All in.

167
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:56,646
No, wait.

168
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:58,518
Twenty thousand.

169
00:33:58,853 --> 00:34:01,253
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

170
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:07,851
Okay. This is on the table.
That's my car. Wanna bet?

171
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,395
I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

172
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,591
Please, no. Give him a chance
to win his money back.

173
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,541
All right, show me, gentlemen.

174
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,985
Three kings.

175
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,923
There you go with my night.

176
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:42,527
Trip aces.

177
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,823
Aces win.

178
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:49,866
Oh, and the valet ticket.

179
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:55,641
Thank you.

180
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,310
Sir.

181
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:31,809
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

182
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:36,010
No wonder he was
in such a foul mood.

183
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:38,445
My mistake.

184
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:39,914
Can I give you a lift home?

185
00:35:40,588 --> 00:35:43,955
That would really send him
over the edge.

186
00:35:44,158 --> 00:35:46,092
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

187
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,385
Well, perhaps you're just
out of practice.

188
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,467
Perhaps.

189
00:35:57,671 --> 00:35:59,400
Well, what about
a drink at my place?

190
00:36:00,307 --> 00:36:02,298
Your place?

191
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,576
-Is it close?
-Very.

192
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:13,851
One drink.

193
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,772
Good evening, sir,
and welcome back.

194
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:42,881
Welcome to my home.

195
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,189
<i>I'm having a hard time seeing
how this is my fault.</i>

196
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:01,061
It's your plan.
All I did was get you the man.

197
00:37:01,268 --> 00:37:05,762
A man who was under surveillance
by the British Secret Service.

198
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:10,043
Which makes me wonder
if I can trust you at all.

199
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:12,812
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

200
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:14,981
But I do care about my reputation.

201
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,180
I have someone else
willing to do the job.

202
00:37:18,385 --> 00:37:20,182
He just needs the particulars...

203
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:22,784
...and payment.

204
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:37,396
You like married women,
don't you, James?

205
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:39,800
It keeps things simple.

206
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:45,541
What is it about bad men?

207
00:37:45,746 --> 00:37:48,715
You, my husband....

208
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:51,578
I had so many chances
to be happy...

209
00:37:51,785 --> 00:37:54,151
...so many nice guys.

210
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,051
Why can't nice guys
be more like you?

211
00:37:57,258 --> 00:37:59,488
Well, because then they'd be bad.

212
00:38:00,427 --> 00:38:02,691
Yes.

213
00:38:05,432 --> 00:38:08,265
But so much more interesting.

214
00:38:12,706 --> 00:38:15,140
What makes your husband
a bad man?

215
00:38:15,342 --> 00:38:17,902
His nature, I suppose.

216
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,773
The nature of his work?

217
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,643
A mystery, I'm afraid.

218
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:29,620
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me
in order to get to him.

219
00:38:29,823 --> 00:38:32,291
How afraid?

220
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,658
Not enough to stop.

221
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,398
Can I ask you a personal question?

222
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:50,737
Now would seem
an appropriate time.

223
00:38:50,945 --> 00:38:53,311
Does "ellipsis"
mean anything to you?

224
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,624
Should I ask him about it?

225
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:07,157
Perhaps later.

226
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:09,288
Yes, dear?

227
00:39:09,496 --> 00:39:11,396
<i>I'm on the last flight
tonight to Miami.</i>

228
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,227
<i>Don't wait up.
I'll be back in the morning.</i>

229
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,767
Okay, I understand.

230
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:19,735
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

231
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:25,678
Apparently he's on
the last flight to Miami...

232
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:30,043
...so you have all night
to question me.

233
00:39:32,886 --> 00:39:34,353
In that case...

234
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:35,681
...we're gonna need...

235
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:38,255
...some more champagne.

236
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:45,563
<i>Good evening. Room Service.</i>

237
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:49,566
Good evening. Can I get a bottle
of chilled Bollinger Grand Année...

238
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:50,998
...and the beluga caviar?

239
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:53,673
<i>-With everything?
-Yes, with everything.</i>

240
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:55,967
<i>-And would that be for two, sir?
-What?</i>

241
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:59,441
<i>-For two?
-No, for one.</i>

242
00:40:32,546 --> 00:40:34,275
Wait here.

243
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:41,515
There you go. Number 53.

244
00:40:45,492 --> 00:40:47,858
<i>Dr. von Hagens' Body Worlds
invites visitors...</i>

245
00:40:48,062 --> 00:40:50,895
<i>...to observe the body's various
locomotive, digestive...</i>

246
00:40:51,098 --> 00:40:52,861
<i>...nervous and vascular systems.</i>

247
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,861
<i>Please may I have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen?</i>

248
00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:01,764
<i>I believe it is something very special,
what we see here.</i>

249
00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:03,129
<i>This is edutainment.</i>

250
00:42:29,496 --> 00:42:31,657
<i>--fixed in dramatic
and athletic poses...</i>

251
00:42:31,899 --> 00:42:35,733
<i>...that reveal the true-to-life spatial
relationships amongst organs.</i>

252
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:51,407
Hello.

253
00:42:51,618 --> 00:42:53,518
Hello.

254
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:05,688
<i>Do not leave your vehicle unattended.</i>

255
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:08,459
<i>Welcome to Miami
International Airport.</i>

256
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,797
<i>Curbside parking in front
of the terminal is restricted....</i>

257
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,792
-Yes.
-It's Bond. I need her now.

258
00:44:50,003 --> 00:44:52,733
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed.
Can I take a message?

259
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,205
Listen, you go and find her, tell her
to call Security at Miami Airport...

260
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,970
...because I think a bomb is about
to go off. Do it now.

261
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:02,108
-Sorry, can I put you on hold?
-I thought you might.

262
00:45:06,553 --> 00:45:09,283
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

263
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,114
I'll call you back.

264
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:38,248
-The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
-What about it?

265
00:45:38,452 --> 00:45:41,683
"The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport."

266
00:46:23,096 --> 00:46:24,120
Oh, my God!

267
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:25,923
<i>Bond? Bond!</i>

268
00:46:28,935 --> 00:46:31,028
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

269
00:46:31,238 --> 00:46:33,172
<i>It's launching today.</i>

270
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:37,369
I gotta go.

271
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:04,438
Stop! Stop!

272
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,072
Get moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

273
00:53:42,202 --> 00:53:46,969
The puts expired. I'm sorry,
I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

274
00:53:47,173 --> 00:53:52,577
One hundred and one million,
two hundred and six thousand dollars.

275
00:53:59,118 --> 00:54:01,279
Someone talked.

276
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:27,011
-You got everything you need?
-Yeah, I have.

277
00:54:27,213 --> 00:54:29,272
I'm gonna get a few more photos....

278
00:54:43,663 --> 00:54:46,689
Quite the body count
you're stacking up.

279
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,230
She was tortured first.
As you'd already killed her husband...

280
00:54:50,436 --> 00:54:53,064
...she must have been
the only one left to question.

281
00:54:53,773 --> 00:54:55,866
Did she know anything
that could compromise you?

282
00:54:56,075 --> 00:54:57,042
No.

283
00:54:57,243 --> 00:55:00,701
-Not your name, what you were after?
-No.

284
00:55:00,914 --> 00:55:02,347
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.

285
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,312
Knew where to put his hands
on weapons...

286
00:55:04,517 --> 00:55:05,950
...and people who could use them.

287
00:55:06,152 --> 00:55:07,779
He worked with anyone
who had money.

288
00:55:07,987 --> 00:55:11,354
For years he was involved with a man
we knew as Le Chiffre...

289
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,458
...a private banker
to the world's terrorists.

290
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:17,118
He invested their money, gave them
access to it wherever they wanted.

291
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,093
Oh, good. You're here.

292
00:55:19,299 --> 00:55:21,859
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.

293
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:26,630
A bit of a mathematical genius
and liked to prove it by playing poker.

294
00:55:55,902 --> 00:55:57,392
So you can keep an eye on me?

295
00:55:58,738 --> 00:56:00,228
Yes.

296
00:56:05,144 --> 00:56:08,272
<i>When they analyzed
the stock market after 9l11...</i>

297
00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:11,780
...the CIA discovered a massive
shorting of airline stocks.

298
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,816
<i>When the stocks hit bottom on 9l12,
somebody made a fortune.</i>

299
00:56:16,522 --> 00:56:19,082
The same thing happened
this morning with Skyfleet stock...

300
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,520
...or was supposed to.

301
00:56:20,727 --> 00:56:24,493
With their prototype destroyed, the
company would be near bankruptcy.

302
00:56:24,697 --> 00:56:28,724
Instead, somebody lost over
$ 100 million betting the wrong way.

303
00:56:29,736 --> 00:56:31,636
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

304
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:34,773
Which would explain how he could
set up a high-stakes poker game...

305
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,669
...at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

306
00:56:36,876 --> 00:56:40,937
Ten players, $ 10 million buy-in,
5 million re-buy.

307
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,911
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.

308
00:56:44,117 --> 00:56:46,677
Good.
Then we'll know where he'll be.

309
00:56:46,886 --> 00:56:48,854
Do you want a clean kill
or to send a message?

310
00:56:49,055 --> 00:56:53,321
We want him alive. Le Chiffre
doesn't have 100 million to lose.

311
00:56:53,526 --> 00:56:56,927
Has he been playing the stock market
with his clients' funds?

312
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:59,963
They're not gonna be too happy
when they find out it's gone.

313
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,531
We can't let him win this game.

314
00:57:01,734 --> 00:57:03,964
If he loses,
he'll have nowhere to run.

315
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,003
We'll give him sanctuary
in return for everything he knows.

316
00:57:07,206 --> 00:57:08,935
I'm putting you in the game...

317
00:57:09,142 --> 00:57:11,804
...replacing someone
who's playing for a syndicate.

318
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:15,572
According to Villiers,
you're the best player in the Service.

319
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:17,813
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

320
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:26,789
I would ask you if you could remain
emotionally detached...

321
00:57:26,993 --> 00:57:30,156
...but I don't think
that's your problem, is it, Bond?

322
00:57:30,863 --> 00:57:32,694
No.

323
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:36,394
Don't worry about keeping in touch.

324
00:57:37,637 --> 00:57:38,934
We'll know where you are.

325
00:57:39,138 --> 00:57:40,503
You can stop pretending.

326
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,399
You knew I wouldn't let this drop,
didn't you?

327
00:57:44,577 --> 00:57:46,875
Well, I knew you were you.

328
00:58:05,431 --> 00:58:07,126
Thank you.

329
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,505
I'm the money.

330
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:19,072
Every penny of it.

331
00:58:21,514 --> 00:58:23,607
The Treasury has agreed
to stake you in the game.

332
00:58:24,984 --> 00:58:26,645
"Vesper."

333
00:58:26,853 --> 00:58:29,344
Well, I do hope you gave
your parents hell for that.

334
00:58:30,123 --> 00:58:31,556
Thank you.

335
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,419
Your boss must be well-connected.

336
00:58:33,626 --> 00:58:36,060
I've never seen so much
go out the door so quickly.

337
00:58:36,662 --> 00:58:38,289
Or quite so stylishly.

338
00:58:40,399 --> 00:58:41,832
May I ask you where it is?

339
00:58:42,034 --> 00:58:44,559
Ten million was wired
to your account in Montenegro...

340
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:49,105
...with a contingency for 5 more
if I deem it a prudent investment.

341
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:52,334
I suppose you've given some thought
to the notion that if you lose...

342
00:58:52,545 --> 00:58:55,446
...our government
will have directly financed terrorism.

343
00:58:58,818 --> 00:59:00,217
What looks good?

344
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,258
So you're telling me it's a matter
of probability and odds.

345
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,431
I was worried there was
some chance involved.

346
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:15,294
Well, only if you assume the player
with the best hand wins.

347
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:17,735
So that would be
what you call "bluffing"?

348
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,604
You've heard the term.

349
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,300
Then you'll also know that in poker
you never play your hand.

350
00:59:25,511 --> 00:59:26,876
You play the man across from you.

351
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:29,445
-And you're good at reading people?
-Yes, I am.

352
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,344
Which is why
I've been able to detect...

353
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:33,678
...an undercurrent
of sarcasm in your voice.

354
00:59:34,387 --> 00:59:37,254
I'm now assured our money
is in good hands.

355
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,519
You don't think
this is a very good plan, do you?

356
00:59:40,726 --> 00:59:42,216
So there is a plan?

357
00:59:42,428 --> 00:59:44,988
I got the impression
we were risking millions of dollars...

358
00:59:45,198 --> 00:59:47,428
...and hundreds of lives
on a game of luck.

359
00:59:47,633 --> 00:59:49,658
What else can you surmise,
Mr. Bond?

360
00:59:49,869 --> 00:59:52,030
About you, Miss Lynd?

361
00:59:52,238 --> 00:59:53,830
Well, your beauty's a problem.

362
00:59:54,307 --> 00:59:56,298
You worry you won't
be taken seriously.

363
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:59,501
Which one can say of any
attractive woman with half a brain.

364
00:59:59,712 --> 01:00:01,270
True, but this one
overcompensates...

365
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,311
...by wearing
slightly masculine clothing...

366
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:05,882
...being more aggressive
than her female colleagues...

367
01:00:06,085 --> 01:00:08,553
...which gives her a somewhat
prickly demeanor...

368
01:00:08,754 --> 01:00:12,087
...and ironically enough, makes it
less likely for her to be accepted...

369
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:14,486
...and promoted
by her male superiors...

370
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,458
...who mistake her insecurities
for arrogance.

371
01:00:17,964 --> 01:00:21,991
Now, I'd have normally
gone with only child...

372
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:25,295
...but, you see, by the way you ignored
the quip about your parents...

373
01:00:25,504 --> 01:00:28,166
...l'm gonna have to go with orphan.

374
01:00:31,143 --> 01:00:33,077
All right.

375
01:00:33,946 --> 01:00:36,506
By the cut of your suit,
you went to Oxford or wherever...

376
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:39,082
...and actually think
human beings dress like that.

377
01:00:39,285 --> 01:00:41,185
But you wear it with such disdain...

378
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,287
...my guess is
you didn't come from money...

379
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:46,049
...and your school friends
never let you forget it.

380
01:00:46,259 --> 01:00:48,193
Which means you were
at that school by the grace...

381
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:51,261
...of someone else's charity,
hence the chip on your shoulder.

382
01:00:51,464 --> 01:00:53,955
And since your first thought about me
ran to orphan...

383
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:56,157
...that's what I'd say you are.

384
01:01:00,106 --> 01:01:02,097
Oh, you are.

385
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,406
I like this poker thing.

386
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:06,373
And that makes perfect sense...

387
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,979
...since Ml6 looks
for maladjusted young men...

388
01:01:09,181 --> 01:01:11,445
...that give little thought
to sacrificing others...

389
01:01:11,651 --> 01:01:13,846
...in order to protect
Queen and country.

390
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:15,145
You know...

391
01:01:15,354 --> 01:01:19,290
...former SAS types with easy smiles
and expensive watches.

392
01:01:19,792 --> 01:01:22,158
-Rolex?
-Omega.

393
01:01:22,361 --> 01:01:24,192
Beautiful.

394
01:01:24,697 --> 01:01:26,358
Now, having just met you...

395
01:01:26,565 --> 01:01:29,398
...I wouldn't go as far as calling you
a cold-hearted bastard.

396
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:30,967
No, of course not.

397
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:32,865
But it wouldn't be a stretch
to imagine.

398
01:01:33,072 --> 01:01:35,233
You think of women
as disposable pleasures...

399
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,534
...rather than meaningful pursuits.

400
01:01:39,011 --> 01:01:41,138
So as charming as you are,
Mr. Bond...

401
01:01:41,347 --> 01:01:43,781
...I will be keeping my eye
on our government's money...

402
01:01:43,983 --> 01:01:45,951
...and off your perfectly formed arse.

403
01:01:46,419 --> 01:01:47,943
You noticed?

404
01:01:48,154 --> 01:01:50,145
Even accountants have imagination.

405
01:01:50,356 --> 01:01:51,687
How was your lamb?

406
01:01:52,091 --> 01:01:53,649
Skewered.

407
01:01:53,859 --> 01:01:55,486
One sympathizes.

408
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:58,820
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

409
01:01:59,031 --> 01:02:01,363
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

410
01:02:16,882 --> 01:02:19,851
-Hotel Splendid, sir?
-That's right.

411
01:02:22,121 --> 01:02:24,351
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

412
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:40,668
It's just last-minute details.

413
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:44,104
Apparently we're very much in love.

414
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,813
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?

415
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,710
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.

416
01:02:51,117 --> 01:02:54,086
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler...

417
01:02:54,286 --> 01:02:55,844
...and you're
Miss Stephanie Broadchest--

418
01:02:56,055 --> 01:02:58,250
-I am not.
-You're gonna have to trust me on this.

419
01:02:58,457 --> 01:03:00,425
Oh, no, I don't.

420
01:03:00,626 --> 01:03:02,526
We've been involved
for quite a while...

421
01:03:03,123 --> 01:03:04,886
...hence the shared suite.

422
01:03:05,092 --> 01:03:07,458
But my family
is strict Roman Catholic...

423
01:03:07,661 --> 01:03:10,391
...so for appearances' sake,
it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

424
01:03:10,597 --> 01:03:13,862
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.

425
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,567
Religion and a securely locked door.

426
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:18,738
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?

427
01:03:18,939 --> 01:03:21,703
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

428
01:03:21,942 --> 01:03:23,034
Smart?

429
01:03:23,644 --> 01:03:25,339
Single.

430
01:03:44,564 --> 01:03:46,555
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

431
01:03:46,767 --> 01:03:49,634
James Bond. You'll find
the reservation under Beech.

432
01:03:49,836 --> 01:03:52,566
-Welcome, Mr. Bond.
-You sign that, dear.

433
01:03:53,206 --> 01:03:55,538
You represent the Treasury.

434
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,542
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

435
01:04:02,749 --> 01:04:04,341
I will. Thank you.

436
01:04:07,354 --> 01:04:08,514
Very funny.

437
01:04:08,722 --> 01:04:10,690
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected...

438
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:12,791
...he knows who I am
and where the money's from.

439
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,390
Which means he's decided
to play me anyway.

440
01:04:15,595 --> 01:04:17,961
So he's either desperate
or he's overly confident...

441
01:04:18,165 --> 01:04:20,463
...but either way, that tells me
something about him.

442
01:04:20,667 --> 01:04:23,192
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.

443
01:04:23,503 --> 01:04:25,130
And now he knows
something about you.

444
01:04:25,339 --> 01:04:27,534
He knows you're reckless.

445
01:04:28,141 --> 01:04:29,972
Take the next one.

446
01:04:30,177 --> 01:04:33,044
There isn't enough room for me
and your ego.

447
01:04:33,447 --> 01:04:35,005
Mr. Bond?

448
01:04:35,215 --> 01:04:37,547
-It was left for you.
-Thank you.

449
01:05:08,682 --> 01:05:10,206
I love you too, M.

450
01:05:49,389 --> 01:05:54,588
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I'm your contact here.

451
01:05:58,098 --> 01:05:59,656
Does he know
we've been watching him?

452
01:05:59,866 --> 01:06:02,528
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

453
01:06:02,736 --> 01:06:07,070
Probably because there's no "we."
Just me.

454
01:06:07,707 --> 01:06:09,675
I'm afraid if you get
into trouble here...

455
01:06:09,876 --> 01:06:13,607
...the cavalry won't be
coming over the nearest hill.

456
01:06:15,148 --> 01:06:16,945
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday...

457
01:06:17,384 --> 01:06:20,911
...and spent the time reestablishing
old relationships.

458
01:06:21,521 --> 01:06:24,456
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.

459
01:06:24,658 --> 01:06:26,558
That's him, with the mustache.

460
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,318
Over my left shoulder.

461
01:06:29,396 --> 01:06:31,591
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.

462
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:33,766
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

463
01:06:33,967 --> 01:06:36,595
He's not a very subtle man.

464
01:06:36,803 --> 01:06:39,966
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly...

465
01:06:40,173 --> 01:06:43,370
...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

466
01:06:51,485 --> 01:06:52,645
I hate to say it...

467
01:06:52,853 --> 01:06:56,812
...but the accountants seem
to be running Ml6 these days.

468
01:06:57,891 --> 01:07:01,088
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.

469
01:07:01,294 --> 01:07:03,558
Many of them are lovely people.

470
01:07:05,098 --> 01:07:08,192
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy...

471
01:07:08,401 --> 01:07:11,996
...with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.

472
01:07:12,205 --> 01:07:16,539
It's amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isn't it?

473
01:07:19,479 --> 01:07:22,107
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.

474
01:07:27,587 --> 01:07:28,952
Yes?

475
01:07:29,623 --> 01:07:31,284
For you.

476
01:07:32,459 --> 01:07:34,950
Something you expect me to wear?

477
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:38,761
I need you looking fabulous.

478
01:07:38,965 --> 01:07:41,263
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck...

479
01:07:41,468 --> 01:07:43,834
...the players will be thinking
about your neckline...

480
01:07:44,037 --> 01:07:45,766
...and not about their cards.

481
01:07:45,972 --> 01:07:48,372
Do you think you can
do that for me?

482
01:07:48,575 --> 01:07:50,509
I'll do my best.

483
01:07:51,578 --> 01:07:53,512
Thank you.

484
01:08:05,525 --> 01:08:06,753
I have a dinner jacket.

485
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:10,293
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.

486
01:08:10,497 --> 01:08:11,657
This is the latter.

487
01:08:11,865 --> 01:08:15,062
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.

488
01:08:15,502 --> 01:08:17,129
How--?

489
01:08:17,938 --> 01:08:19,405
It's tailored.

490
01:08:19,606 --> 01:08:22,166
I sized you up the moment we met.

491
01:09:15,862 --> 01:09:18,490
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.

492
01:09:20,433 --> 01:09:22,094
Thank you.

493
01:09:32,879 --> 01:09:35,006
And you must be
Mr. Bliss' replacement.

494
01:09:35,215 --> 01:09:37,308
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

495
01:09:38,518 --> 01:09:41,316
Or is that Bond?
I'm a little confused.

496
01:09:41,521 --> 01:09:43,955
Well, we wouldn't want that,
would we?

497
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,391
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

498
01:09:55,602 --> 01:09:58,196
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold 'em poker.

499
01:09:58,405 --> 01:10:00,339
Five communal cards,
two in the hole.

500
01:10:00,807 --> 01:10:03,571
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland...

501
01:10:03,777 --> 01:10:05,005
...holding the stakes.

502
01:10:07,314 --> 01:10:09,839
You have each deposited
$ 10 million buy-in.

503
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:12,951
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.

504
01:10:13,153 --> 01:10:15,246
The money will remain in escrow
until I return...

505
01:10:15,455 --> 01:10:18,185
...and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password...

506
01:10:18,391 --> 01:10:19,551
...into the encryptor...

507
01:10:19,759 --> 01:10:21,488
...whereupon the entire sum
will be wired...

508
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,822
...to any bank account
in the world you nominate.

509
01:10:24,397 --> 01:10:26,126
Mr. Bond?

510
01:10:26,566 --> 01:10:27,726
We proceed alphabetically.

511
01:10:27,934 --> 01:10:30,368
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.

512
01:10:38,778 --> 01:10:39,938
Six letters or more.

513
01:10:53,026 --> 01:10:55,688
High card for dealer position.

514
01:11:02,736 --> 01:11:04,033
It's Signor Gallardo.

515
01:11:04,237 --> 01:11:07,263
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000...

516
01:11:07,474 --> 01:11:10,932
...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,
$ 10,000.

517
01:11:13,046 --> 01:11:15,071
Well, enjoy the game.

518
01:11:38,938 --> 01:11:40,030
Four players.

519
01:11:42,642 --> 01:11:43,973
It's your bet.

520
01:11:45,512 --> 01:11:46,979
Check.

521
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,977
Check.

522
01:11:53,286 --> 01:11:55,345
Bet. Fifty thousand.

523
01:12:08,568 --> 01:12:09,830
Call.

524
01:12:13,106 --> 01:12:14,368
Fold.

525
01:12:16,576 --> 01:12:18,976
Fold. Heads up.

526
01:12:23,283 --> 01:12:24,716
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

527
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:38,789
Bet. One hundred thousand.

528
01:12:41,901 --> 01:12:44,893
Weren't you supposed to enter
so the others could see you?

529
01:12:45,104 --> 01:12:48,130
Was I? Forgive me.

530
01:12:48,675 --> 01:12:50,870
Good luck, darling.

531
01:12:54,681 --> 01:12:57,081
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

532
01:12:59,052 --> 01:13:00,246
Monsieur Bond?

533
01:13:00,453 --> 01:13:03,115
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?

534
01:13:03,923 --> 01:13:05,652
Call.

535
01:13:10,797 --> 01:13:11,957
Hello.

536
01:13:12,165 --> 01:13:15,760
I suppose I don't have to tell you
how beautiful you look.

537
01:13:15,969 --> 01:13:19,097
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.

538
01:13:19,305 --> 01:13:20,272
Champagne.

539
01:13:23,977 --> 01:13:25,842
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

540
01:13:36,923 --> 01:13:38,220
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

541
01:13:44,631 --> 01:13:48,397
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

542
01:13:50,069 --> 01:13:53,232
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

543
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:55,236
Mr. Bond?

544
01:13:58,144 --> 01:13:59,475
Fold.

545
01:14:06,853 --> 01:14:09,185
Send the barman over, please.

546
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:20,128
A dry martini. Wait.

547
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:22,028
Three measures Gordon's,
one of vodka...

548
01:14:22,235 --> 01:14:24,066
...half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice...

549
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:27,103
-...then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
-Yes, sir.

550
01:14:27,307 --> 01:14:30,174
-You know, I'll have one of those.
-So will I.

551
01:14:31,144 --> 01:14:32,372
Certainly.

552
01:14:33,313 --> 01:14:37,215
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

553
01:14:38,084 --> 01:14:39,415
That's it?

554
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,312
Anyone want to play poker now?

555
01:14:42,522 --> 01:14:43,682
Someone's in a hurry.

556
01:14:52,699 --> 01:14:54,633
Would you excuse me?

557
01:15:08,147 --> 01:15:09,478
You taste nice.

558
01:15:09,682 --> 01:15:12,617
-I thought we dispensed with covers.
-No.

559
01:15:12,819 --> 01:15:16,516
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.

560
01:15:16,723 --> 01:15:18,247
-Is he watching?
-Yes.

561
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:19,516
Good.

562
01:15:19,726 --> 01:15:22,490
This is me in character pissed off
because you're losing so fast...

563
01:15:22,695 --> 01:15:24,458
...we won't be here past midnight.

564
01:15:24,664 --> 01:15:27,633
Oddly, my character's feelings
mirror my own.

565
01:15:28,267 --> 01:15:29,825
Check.

566
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:32,301
-You know, that's not half bad.
-Up to you.

567
01:15:32,505 --> 01:15:34,405
I'm gonna have to think up
a name for that.

568
01:15:35,942 --> 01:15:38,502
It was worth it to discover his tell.

569
01:15:38,845 --> 01:15:40,107
What do you mean?

570
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,505
The twitch he has to hide
when he bluffs.

571
01:15:42,715 --> 01:15:46,845
-Bluffs? He had the best hand.
-Which he got on the last card.

572
01:15:47,053 --> 01:15:49,248
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and he'd know that.

573
01:15:49,455 --> 01:15:51,423
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.

574
01:15:51,624 --> 01:15:53,148
Winning was blind luck.

575
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:55,190
-Did you get the bug?
-Yes.

576
01:15:55,395 --> 01:15:57,260
Bet. One hundred thousand.

577
01:15:57,463 --> 01:15:58,987
Thank you.

578
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,233
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

579
01:16:02,435 --> 01:16:05,461
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

580
01:16:06,305 --> 01:16:07,738
Call.

581
01:16:09,342 --> 01:16:11,310
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

582
01:16:13,846 --> 01:16:16,371
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mesdames, Messieurs...

583
01:16:16,582 --> 01:16:18,345
...we've now been
playing for four hours.

584
01:16:18,551 --> 01:16:23,011
It's time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

585
01:16:51,851 --> 01:16:57,619
Well, I think I'll report
on the evening's frivolities.

586
01:16:59,225 --> 01:17:01,090
So?

587
01:17:01,294 --> 01:17:03,421
You want to do what to me?

588
01:17:03,629 --> 01:17:04,960
You've lost me completely.

589
01:17:05,164 --> 01:17:08,099
You just said you can't wait
to get me back to the room. Come on.

590
01:17:32,058 --> 01:17:35,687
So, what's so damn important?

591
01:17:38,131 --> 01:17:39,723
I'm sorry.

592
01:17:42,602 --> 01:17:44,160
Where is my money?

593
01:17:48,708 --> 01:17:49,902
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

594
01:17:50,109 --> 01:17:52,339
You're holding a parcel for me.

595
01:17:56,983 --> 01:17:58,644
Thank you.

596
01:17:59,919 --> 01:18:04,083
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?

597
01:18:04,624 --> 01:18:06,421
Your money is safe.

598
01:18:08,227 --> 01:18:09,956
Open that.

599
01:18:25,978 --> 01:18:28,037
You'll have it tomorrow.

600
01:18:28,981 --> 01:18:30,278
All of it.

601
01:18:43,763 --> 01:18:47,722
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.

602
01:18:52,271 --> 01:18:54,000
Hold out your arm.

603
01:18:55,274 --> 01:18:57,071
Hold out your arm, my beauty...

604
01:18:57,710 --> 01:18:59,302
...or I will take your head.

605
01:19:09,222 --> 01:19:12,157
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

606
01:19:25,504 --> 01:19:26,471
Stairs.

607
01:19:30,977 --> 01:19:33,605
Not a word of protest.

608
01:19:34,213 --> 01:19:36,773
You should find a new boyfriend.

609
01:21:38,938 --> 01:21:40,633
Go find Mathis.

610
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:44,071
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.

611
01:21:44,276 --> 01:21:47,302
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

612
01:22:50,142 --> 01:22:52,736
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

613
01:22:53,079 --> 01:22:56,776
I hope our little game
isn't causing you to perspire.

614
01:22:56,982 --> 01:22:58,210
A little.

615
01:22:58,417 --> 01:23:01,978
But I won't consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.

616
01:23:02,188 --> 01:23:06,215
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's
ready, let's continue the game.

617
01:24:07,453 --> 01:24:11,822
It's like there's blood on my hands.
It's not coming off.

618
01:24:12,858 --> 01:24:14,723
Here, let's see.

619
01:24:30,309 --> 01:24:32,140
That's better.

620
01:24:36,215 --> 01:24:37,546
You cold?

621
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:39,149
Yeah.

622
01:24:39,351 --> 01:24:41,251
Here.

623
01:25:37,977 --> 01:25:40,241
You have any trouble
with the bodies?

624
01:25:40,613 --> 01:25:42,740
Less than some.

625
01:25:56,528 --> 01:26:00,259
Being dead doesn't mean
one can't still be helpful.

626
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,896
That'll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.

627
01:26:04,103 --> 01:26:06,333
He'll be wondering who's gonna
come for him next.

628
01:26:07,973 --> 01:26:10,203
How's our girl?

629
01:26:10,743 --> 01:26:13,940
Melted your cold heart yet?

630
01:26:31,864 --> 01:26:33,058
Call.

631
01:26:33,265 --> 01:26:34,664
Fold.

632
01:26:34,867 --> 01:26:36,835
And call.

633
01:26:38,137 --> 01:26:40,196
Three players.

634
01:26:43,809 --> 01:26:45,572
Three hundred grand.

635
01:26:45,778 --> 01:26:47,439
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

636
01:26:49,315 --> 01:26:50,976
Call.

637
01:26:52,718 --> 01:26:53,685
And call.

638
01:26:58,857 --> 01:27:00,154
Three players.

639
01:27:04,496 --> 01:27:05,485
Check.

640
01:27:11,003 --> 01:27:12,163
Monsieur Bond?

641
01:27:22,047 --> 01:27:24,481
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

642
01:27:36,161 --> 01:27:40,461
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

643
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:42,691
My God, James was right.

644
01:27:43,802 --> 01:27:45,736
It's up to you.

645
01:27:51,877 --> 01:27:54,277
Raise. One million.

646
01:28:01,353 --> 01:28:03,719
Seems someone knows
something I don't.

647
01:28:04,757 --> 01:28:05,951
Fold.

648
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:07,921
Heads up, gentlemen.

649
01:28:08,127 --> 01:28:09,685
It's up to you.

650
01:28:23,876 --> 01:28:25,343
Two.

651
01:28:26,111 --> 01:28:28,204
Re-raise. Two million.

652
01:28:30,182 --> 01:28:32,241
And it's up to you.

653
01:28:43,328 --> 01:28:45,193
I'm all in.

654
01:28:52,604 --> 01:28:54,970
Well, it's 14 million
and 500,000.

655
01:28:55,174 --> 01:28:57,506
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

656
01:29:00,145 --> 01:29:04,514
Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.

657
01:29:05,451 --> 01:29:08,181
-Call.
-Call.

658
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:10,986
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

659
01:29:12,724 --> 01:29:15,124
Full house. Kings and aces.

660
01:29:15,327 --> 01:29:17,352
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

661
01:29:30,309 --> 01:29:34,006
It's four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

662
01:29:38,016 --> 01:29:41,179
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

663
01:29:41,854 --> 01:29:43,014
Please.

664
01:29:43,222 --> 01:29:45,520
We will now break for one hour.

665
01:29:45,724 --> 01:29:49,057
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.

666
01:29:56,502 --> 01:29:58,163
Good game.

667
01:30:26,298 --> 01:30:29,631
Well, I'm gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.

668
01:30:30,202 --> 01:30:32,534
I can't do that, James.

669
01:30:33,071 --> 01:30:35,471
Look, I made a mistake.

670
01:30:36,275 --> 01:30:39,267
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.

671
01:30:39,478 --> 01:30:40,911
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry?

672
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:43,413
Sorry?

673
01:30:43,615 --> 01:30:45,378
Try putting that in a sentence.

674
01:30:45,584 --> 01:30:46,983
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win...

675
01:30:47,185 --> 01:30:49,517
...continue funding terror and killing."
That kind of sorry?

676
01:30:49,721 --> 01:30:52,781
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego can't take it.

677
01:30:52,991 --> 01:30:54,390
That's what this is about.

678
01:30:54,593 --> 01:30:56,561
All you're going to do now
is lose more.

679
01:30:57,195 --> 01:30:58,355
Then you're an idiot.

680
01:30:58,564 --> 01:31:01,431
-I'm sorry?
-I said, you're a bloody idiot.

681
01:31:03,335 --> 01:31:05,599
Look in my eyes.

682
01:31:06,371 --> 01:31:08,134
I can beat this man, you know that.

683
01:31:10,776 --> 01:31:13,370
Get your hand off my arm.

684
01:31:36,268 --> 01:31:37,428
Vodka martini.

685
01:31:37,636 --> 01:31:40,434
-Shaken or stirred?
-Do I look like I give a damn?

686
01:31:58,624 --> 01:32:00,888
-James.
-Get the girl out.

687
01:32:08,166 --> 01:32:09,133
Funny game, right?

688
01:32:09,334 --> 01:32:12,428
Sorry, I should've introduced myself,
seeing as we're related.

689
01:32:13,171 --> 01:32:16,265
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

690
01:32:18,276 --> 01:32:19,675
You should have a little faith.

691
01:32:19,878 --> 01:32:22,369
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.

692
01:32:22,581 --> 01:32:24,845
Had. Excuse me.

693
01:32:25,283 --> 01:32:27,217
You're not buying in?

694
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,285
No.

695
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:37,561
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.
I'm not gonna last much longer.

696
01:32:37,763 --> 01:32:40,425
You have a better chance.
I'll stake you.

697
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,593
I'm saying I'll give you the money
to keep going.

698
01:32:43,802 --> 01:32:48,671
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.

699
01:32:50,042 --> 01:32:52,374
And what about the winnings?

700
01:32:53,078 --> 01:32:55,638
Does it look like
we need the money?

701
01:33:07,192 --> 01:33:09,285
Shall we up the blinds?

702
01:33:11,496 --> 01:33:13,191
Why not?

703
01:33:16,668 --> 01:33:18,158
Bet.

704
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:21,899
Raise.

705
01:33:37,422 --> 01:33:39,356
And fold.

706
01:33:41,593 --> 01:33:43,561
Excuse me, please.

707
01:33:45,263 --> 01:33:46,890
Call.

708
01:33:48,366 --> 01:33:49,594
Raise.

709
01:33:49,801 --> 01:33:53,259
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

710
01:33:55,774 --> 01:33:57,708
-Fold.
-Thank you.

711
01:34:00,078 --> 01:34:01,238
Fold.

712
01:34:05,517 --> 01:34:07,041
Fold.

713
01:34:11,957 --> 01:34:13,390
Thank you.

714
01:34:13,592 --> 01:34:14,559
Wins.

715
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:36,840
Deal me out.

716
01:34:37,849 --> 01:34:40,977
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

717
01:34:42,954 --> 01:34:44,512
Small blind, please.

718
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:51,020
-Who is it?
-It's 007.

719
01:35:52,691 --> 01:35:55,251
Bond's been poisoned.
He's going into cardiac arrest.

720
01:35:57,429 --> 01:35:59,863
Stay calm and don't interrupt.
Because you'll be dead...

721
01:36:00,065 --> 01:36:02,693
...within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.

722
01:36:03,001 --> 01:36:04,161
I'm all ears.

723
01:36:04,369 --> 01:36:05,893
Remove the defibrillator
from the pouch.

724
01:36:06,104 --> 01:36:08,436
<i>-Do we know what it is yet?
-We're still scanning.</i>

725
01:36:14,079 --> 01:36:16,809
Attach the leads to your chest.

726
01:36:25,457 --> 01:36:27,425
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

727
01:36:27,726 --> 01:36:30,524
What do we give him? The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines...

728
01:36:30,729 --> 01:36:32,356
<i>...hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?</i>

729
01:36:32,564 --> 01:36:35,294
<i>-As soon as it reads charged--
-Lidocaine. That'll work.</i>

730
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,968
Bond, don't push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Don't push it.

731
01:36:38,169 --> 01:36:39,602
His heart's gonna stop.

732
01:36:39,804 --> 01:36:42,170
<i>There's only time for one charge
before he passes out.</i>

733
01:36:43,174 --> 01:36:47,042
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

734
01:36:47,245 --> 01:36:49,543
<i>That'll counteract the digitalis.</i>

735
01:36:52,851 --> 01:36:54,648
You're going to pass out
in a few seconds.

736
01:36:54,853 --> 01:36:56,286
You need to keep
your heart going.

737
01:36:56,488 --> 01:36:57,716
Push the red button now, Bond.

738
01:37:03,828 --> 01:37:06,262
-Bond, push the damn button!
-Do it now!

739
01:37:54,145 --> 01:37:56,113
-You okay?
-Me?

740
01:37:59,451 --> 01:38:02,045
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

741
01:38:02,253 --> 01:38:05,916
-Now get yourself off to a hospital.
-I will do.

742
01:38:06,925 --> 01:38:08,324
As soon as I've won this game.

743
01:38:08,526 --> 01:38:11,256
You're not seriously
going back there?

744
01:38:13,832 --> 01:38:15,732
I wouldn't dream of it.

745
01:38:17,369 --> 01:38:18,961
Bet. One million.

746
01:38:22,707 --> 01:38:24,265
-All in.
-Call. All in.

747
01:38:24,476 --> 01:38:27,070
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

748
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:30,980
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

749
01:38:34,919 --> 01:38:37,353
Queen plays. Wins.

750
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:47,124
Oh, I'm sorry.

751
01:38:47,332 --> 01:38:49,892
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

752
01:38:51,336 --> 01:38:54,931
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game...

753
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:56,903
...which means no more buy-ins.

754
01:38:57,108 --> 01:39:00,305
The big blind is now
1 million dollars.

755
01:39:07,385 --> 01:39:08,511
Four players.

756
01:39:11,322 --> 01:39:12,687
It's your bet.

757
01:39:16,728 --> 01:39:17,888
-Monsieur Bond?
-Check.

758
01:39:18,096 --> 01:39:21,930
-Check.
-Twenty-four million in the pot already.

759
01:39:24,803 --> 01:39:26,930
Check. And check.

760
01:39:27,372 --> 01:39:28,964
All check.

761
01:39:29,307 --> 01:39:30,501
Four players.

762
01:39:35,513 --> 01:39:36,912
-Check.
-Check.

763
01:39:42,821 --> 01:39:44,982
All in. Six million.

764
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:48,415
Bet. Six million. All in.

765
01:39:53,865 --> 01:39:56,197
Five million. All in.

766
01:39:56,401 --> 01:39:58,961
Bet is 6 million.

767
01:40:06,478 --> 01:40:07,809
Raise.

768
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:10,574
Raise.

769
01:40:10,782 --> 01:40:14,047
Twelve million. Heads up.

770
01:40:44,649 --> 01:40:47,777
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

771
01:40:50,221 --> 01:40:52,052
Raise. All in.

772
01:41:10,942 --> 01:41:14,537
Well, I think I will call you
on that one.

773
01:41:21,386 --> 01:41:22,580
Call.

774
01:41:34,465 --> 01:41:38,663
One hundred and fifteen million
in the pot.

775
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:41,600
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

776
01:41:45,243 --> 01:41:47,177
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

777
01:41:55,753 --> 01:41:58,745
Full house. Eights full of aces.

778
01:42:16,908 --> 01:42:19,035
A higher full house.

779
01:42:19,244 --> 01:42:20,711
Aces full of sixes.

780
01:42:26,718 --> 01:42:27,912
Monsieur Bond.

781
01:42:44,969 --> 01:42:47,460
Five and seven of spades.

782
01:42:47,672 --> 01:42:49,139
A straight flush.

783
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:50,637
Four to the eight.

784
01:42:50,842 --> 01:42:52,935
The high hand.

785
01:42:57,649 --> 01:42:59,173
Monsieur Bond wins.

786
01:43:00,184 --> 01:43:02,482
-For you.
-Thank you very much.

787
01:43:04,922 --> 01:43:06,116
Congratulations.

788
01:43:06,324 --> 01:43:09,851
-He's all yours.
-Much appreciated, brother.

789
01:43:16,834 --> 01:43:17,994
Congratulations.

790
01:43:18,202 --> 01:43:20,067
You know,
I think a celebration's in order.

791
01:43:20,271 --> 01:43:22,796
You were almost dead an hour ago.

792
01:43:23,675 --> 01:43:26,667
Come on, I'm famished.

793
01:43:37,088 --> 01:43:38,953
Thank you.

794
01:43:46,564 --> 01:43:50,466
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.

795
01:43:50,668 --> 01:43:53,296
They're going to extract him
before dawn.

796
01:43:54,005 --> 01:43:55,973
You know, I think
I'll call that a Vesper.

797
01:43:57,375 --> 01:43:59,172
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

798
01:43:59,377 --> 01:44:03,541
No. Because once you've tasted it,
that's all you want to drink.

799
01:44:06,150 --> 01:44:09,244
-I thought that was quite a good line.
-It was a very good line.

800
01:44:10,488 --> 01:44:11,978
But you're laughing at it.

801
01:44:12,323 --> 01:44:16,589
-Not so much it as you.
-Well, that's fine then.

802
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:24,458
I figured out what that is.

803
01:44:26,904 --> 01:44:29,168
It's an Algerian love knot.

804
01:44:29,374 --> 01:44:32,571
Really? I thought it was
just something pretty.

805
01:44:32,777 --> 01:44:34,404
No, you didn't.

806
01:44:35,313 --> 01:44:36,780
Someone gave that to you.

807
01:44:40,485 --> 01:44:42,214
He's a very lucky man.

808
01:44:48,726 --> 01:44:51,559
You can switch off so easily,
can't you?

809
01:44:51,929 --> 01:44:54,124
It doesn't bother you,
killing those people?

810
01:44:54,732 --> 01:44:57,758
Well, I wouldn't be very good
at my job if it did.

811
01:44:58,703 --> 01:45:00,933
I don't believe you.

812
01:45:01,572 --> 01:45:03,733
You've got a choice, you know?

813
01:45:03,941 --> 01:45:05,533
Just because
you've done something...

814
01:45:05,743 --> 01:45:07,870
...doesn't mean
you have to keep doing it.

815
01:45:08,079 --> 01:45:10,980
Why is it people who can't take advice
always insist on giving it?

816
01:45:11,182 --> 01:45:13,150
You think I can't take
my own advice?

817
01:45:14,051 --> 01:45:16,713
I think something is driving you.

818
01:45:17,255 --> 01:45:19,280
And I think I'll never find out
what that is.

819
01:45:25,229 --> 01:45:27,356
Mathis needs me.

820
01:45:28,032 --> 01:45:29,294
Good night.

821
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:30,831
Congratulations again.

822
01:45:50,121 --> 01:45:51,952
Mathis.

823
01:47:43,901 --> 01:47:47,837
I'm afraid your friend Mathis
is really...

824
01:47:49,106 --> 01:47:50,903
...my friend Mathis.

825
01:49:33,678 --> 01:49:36,408
You've taken good care
of your body.

826
01:49:42,953 --> 01:49:45,444
Such a waste.

827
01:50:02,707 --> 01:50:04,538
You know...

828
01:50:04,909 --> 01:50:08,037
...I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.

829
01:50:08,245 --> 01:50:10,440
It's the simplest thing...

830
01:50:10,648 --> 01:50:14,175
...to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.

831
01:50:15,686 --> 01:50:16,846
And of course...

832
01:50:17,054 --> 01:50:20,023
...it's not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge...

833
01:50:20,224 --> 01:50:22,886
...that if you do not yield
soon enough...

834
01:50:23,594 --> 01:50:27,223
...there will be little left
to identify you as a man.

835
01:50:33,304 --> 01:50:35,204
The only question remains...

836
01:50:36,707 --> 01:50:38,868
...will you yield in time?

837
01:50:40,945 --> 01:50:44,073
I want the money.

838
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:06,236
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasn't already.

839
01:51:06,437 --> 01:51:08,803
So all I need from you
is the password.

840
01:51:18,582 --> 01:51:21,813
The password, please.

841
01:51:26,056 --> 01:51:28,354
I've got a little itch...

842
01:51:28,559 --> 01:51:30,424
...down there.

843
01:51:31,195 --> 01:51:32,662
Would you mind?

844
01:51:40,404 --> 01:51:43,805
No! No! No!

845
01:51:44,775 --> 01:51:48,472
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

846
01:51:48,679 --> 01:51:51,113
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

847
01:51:53,050 --> 01:51:54,540
Yeah!

848
01:51:55,786 --> 01:51:59,085
Yes, yes, yes.

849
01:52:04,762 --> 01:52:10,200
Now the whole world's gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.

850
01:52:11,502 --> 01:52:13,493
I died?

851
01:52:13,704 --> 01:52:15,001
-I died?
-Yes.

852
01:52:15,206 --> 01:52:18,175
Because no matter what you do,
I'm not gonna give you the password.

853
01:52:18,375 --> 01:52:20,206
Which means your clients
will hunt you down...

854
01:52:20,411 --> 01:52:23,244
...and cut you into pieces of meat
while you're still breathing.

855
01:52:23,447 --> 01:52:24,846
Because if you kill me...

856
01:52:25,049 --> 01:52:27,108
...there'll be nowhere else to hide.

857
01:52:27,318 --> 01:52:30,116
But you are so wrong!

858
01:52:30,321 --> 01:52:33,313
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend...

859
01:52:33,524 --> 01:52:36,322
...your people would still welcome me
with open arms...

860
01:52:37,862 --> 01:52:41,491
...because they need what I know.

861
01:52:42,733 --> 01:52:44,792
The big picture.

862
01:52:52,710 --> 01:52:54,940
Give me the password...

863
01:52:55,145 --> 01:52:57,079
...and I will at least let her live.

864
01:53:00,751 --> 01:53:03,845
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.

865
01:53:16,934 --> 01:53:19,061
You really aren't going to tell me,
are you?

866
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:21,067
No.

867
01:53:22,907 --> 01:53:24,807
So I think...

868
01:53:29,346 --> 01:53:32,782
...l'll feed you
what you seem not to value.

869
01:53:45,930 --> 01:53:48,194
I'll get the money.

870
01:53:49,099 --> 01:53:51,590
Tell them I'll get the money.

871
01:53:51,802 --> 01:53:56,262
Money isn't as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.

872
01:54:19,897 --> 01:54:21,296
Francesco.

873
01:54:22,232 --> 01:54:24,132
Francesco.

874
01:54:36,847 --> 01:54:38,974
Vesper.

875
01:54:40,851 --> 01:54:42,751
Vesper.

876
01:54:44,888 --> 01:54:46,412
No.

877
01:54:47,224 --> 01:54:48,555
Not him.

878
01:54:48,759 --> 01:54:50,659
Not Mathis.

879
01:54:52,496 --> 01:54:53,656
No.

880
01:54:54,498 --> 01:54:56,523
I'll get the doctor.

881
01:54:59,303 --> 01:55:01,100
Not him.

882
01:55:03,007 --> 01:55:04,167
Any ideas?

883
01:55:07,911 --> 01:55:11,745
-What?
-Why they left the two of you alive.

884
01:55:13,751 --> 01:55:15,184
Where is she?

885
01:55:16,220 --> 01:55:18,120
Sleeping.

886
01:55:18,722 --> 01:55:21,987
Well, I'm supposed
to get you to drink this.

887
01:55:23,093 --> 01:55:24,754
It's just odd...

888
01:55:24,962 --> 01:55:28,864
...killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.

889
01:55:29,066 --> 01:55:32,399
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.

890
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:35,697
Get a look at the killer?

891
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:37,969
No.

892
01:55:39,443 --> 01:55:40,876
Shame.

893
01:55:42,546 --> 01:55:44,275
Drink up.

894
01:55:47,684 --> 01:55:49,845
Anything else you remember?

895
01:55:50,054 --> 01:55:52,079
Anything that can help us?

896
01:55:52,289 --> 01:55:53,916
Help us?

897
01:55:54,124 --> 01:55:56,354
Or help you?

898
01:56:36,733 --> 01:56:37,893
Hello.

899
01:56:38,102 --> 01:56:39,933
Hello.

900
01:56:41,638 --> 01:56:42,935
You all right?

901
01:56:43,574 --> 01:56:45,735
I can't resist waking you.

902
01:56:45,943 --> 01:56:50,573
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you haven't seen me in years.

903
01:56:51,715 --> 01:56:53,706
It makes me feel reborn.

904
01:56:57,454 --> 01:57:00,548
If you'd just been born...

905
01:57:01,225 --> 01:57:03,489
...wouldn't you be naked?

906
01:57:04,261 --> 01:57:06,456
You have me there.

907
01:57:09,133 --> 01:57:11,829
You can have me anywhere.

908
01:57:13,904 --> 01:57:15,428
I can?

909
01:57:15,639 --> 01:57:19,507
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.

910
01:57:20,511 --> 01:57:23,412
Does this mean
that you're warming to me?

911
01:57:23,614 --> 01:57:25,809
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

912
01:57:26,016 --> 01:57:27,449
It's just that not so long ago...

913
01:57:27,651 --> 01:57:31,519
...I would have described
your feelings towards me as....

914
01:57:32,990 --> 01:57:35,618
I'm trying to think
of a better word than "loathing."

915
01:57:36,193 --> 01:57:39,094
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

916
01:57:39,630 --> 01:57:42,121
That is something to be afraid of.

917
01:57:44,902 --> 01:57:48,531
-Hello.
-Oh, perfect timing.

918
01:57:49,973 --> 01:57:52,703
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?

919
01:57:52,910 --> 01:57:54,901
My apologies,
I do not mean to rush...

920
01:57:55,112 --> 01:57:57,103
...but 120 million
is a large sum of money.

921
01:57:57,314 --> 01:58:00,147
It certainly is. You didn't bring
any chocolates with you?

922
01:58:00,350 --> 01:58:02,477
I'm afraid not.

923
01:58:03,687 --> 01:58:06,554
If you would type in
the account number.

924
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:15,029
And now the password.

925
01:58:15,832 --> 01:58:16,992
You can do that.

926
01:58:17,701 --> 01:58:19,760
I would if I knew what it was.

927
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:26,741
V-E-S-P-E-R.

928
01:58:37,588 --> 01:58:39,385
The funds have been transferred.

929
01:58:39,590 --> 01:58:42,457
Sorry for disturbing you.

930
01:58:44,294 --> 01:58:47,525
-Auf Wiedersehen.
-Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

931
01:58:54,104 --> 01:58:55,503
You know, James...

932
01:58:58,108 --> 01:59:01,009
...I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you...

933
01:59:01,211 --> 01:59:04,510
...was your smile
and your little finger...

934
01:59:04,715 --> 01:59:07,445
...you'd still be more of a man
than anyone I've ever met.

935
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:20,523
That's because you know
what I can do with my little finger.

936
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:27,268
-I have no idea.
-But you're aching to find out.

937
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:34,476
You're not going to let me
in there, are you?

938
01:59:35,212 --> 01:59:37,339
You've got your armor back on.

939
01:59:37,547 --> 01:59:38,775
That's that.

940
01:59:40,284 --> 01:59:42,844
I have no armor left.

941
01:59:44,087 --> 01:59:46,578
You've stripped it from me.

942
01:59:47,457 --> 01:59:49,925
Whatever is left of me....

943
01:59:50,394 --> 01:59:53,261
Whatever is left of me...

944
01:59:54,097 --> 01:59:56,065
...whatever I am...

945
01:59:56,266 --> 01:59:58,757
...l'm yours.

946
02:01:00,197 --> 02:01:03,189
I suppose M won't miss me
for a couple of days.

947
02:01:03,934 --> 02:01:05,765
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

948
02:01:05,969 --> 02:01:07,163
Mathis?

949
02:01:07,371 --> 02:01:09,396
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffre's tell?

950
02:01:09,606 --> 02:01:12,040
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

951
02:01:12,609 --> 02:01:14,167
That's how he wiped me out.

952
02:01:14,378 --> 02:01:18,041
Same goes for the implant. Can't say
I'm too sorry about losing that.

953
02:01:18,248 --> 02:01:20,443
I can't believe it.

954
02:01:20,650 --> 02:01:22,242
No, neither could I.

955
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:25,119
I thought he had my back.

956
02:01:25,789 --> 02:01:27,586
But there you go, lesson learned.

957
02:01:28,992 --> 02:01:31,392
Does everyone have a tell?

958
02:01:33,330 --> 02:01:35,059
Yes.

959
02:01:38,001 --> 02:01:39,764
Everyone.

960
02:01:40,170 --> 02:01:42,001
Everyone except you.

961
02:01:46,476 --> 02:01:48,501
I wonder if that's why I love you.

962
02:01:50,547 --> 02:01:52,481
You love me?

963
02:01:53,016 --> 02:01:55,280
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you...

964
02:01:55,485 --> 02:01:57,680
...until one of us
has to find an honest job.

965
02:01:58,321 --> 02:02:02,382
But I think that's gonna have to be you.
I've no idea what an honest job is.

966
02:02:03,293 --> 02:02:04,726
You're serious.

967
02:02:05,695 --> 02:02:07,595
Like you said...

968
02:02:08,165 --> 02:02:09,860
...you do what I do for too long...

969
02:02:10,066 --> 02:02:12,864
...and there won't be any soul
left to salvage.

970
02:02:13,069 --> 02:02:15,936
I'm leaving with
what little I have left.

971
02:02:17,941 --> 02:02:20,034
Is that enough for you?

972
02:04:04,381 --> 02:04:06,281
-Come on.
-No. No.

973
02:04:06,783 --> 02:04:09,980
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

974
02:04:10,186 --> 02:04:12,381
What's the time?

975
02:04:14,624 --> 02:04:16,683
How much do we need
to float for a month?

976
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:18,923
I've got plenty.

977
02:04:19,129 --> 02:04:23,065
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.

978
02:04:26,002 --> 02:04:28,334
You stopped wearing the necklace.

979
02:04:28,538 --> 02:04:31,701
Yeah. It was time.

980
02:04:31,908 --> 02:04:34,638
Time enough to get over someone?

981
02:04:39,416 --> 02:04:42,783
To realize sometimes
you can forget the past.

982
02:04:51,494 --> 02:04:53,394
Though apparently not
your employer.

983
02:04:57,834 --> 02:05:01,065
Back in one month.

984
02:05:02,138 --> 02:05:04,538
Come on. I'll get the money...

985
02:05:04,741 --> 02:05:06,902
...you get supplies.

986
02:05:36,573 --> 02:05:39,007
I'll see you back here
in half an hour.

987
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:05,934
-Hello, M.
-I got your note.

988
02:06:06,136 --> 02:06:07,797
<i>Yes?</i>

989
02:06:08,004 --> 02:06:09,835
We'll talk about that later.

990
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:13,032
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here...

991
02:06:13,243 --> 02:06:15,803
...wondering if you're ever
going to deposit the winnings.

992
02:06:19,516 --> 02:06:22,349
That's a shame.
I didn't think they'd miss it.

993
02:06:22,552 --> 02:06:25,851
<i>Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.</i>

994
02:06:26,056 --> 02:06:28,217
So you'll be depositing it today.

995
02:06:28,558 --> 02:06:31,186
On my way to the bank right now.

996
02:06:31,594 --> 02:06:34,290
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

997
02:06:34,764 --> 02:06:35,924
<i>Hello.</i>

998
02:06:36,132 --> 02:06:39,533
Mr. Mendel? I'm having trouble
accessing the funds in my account.

999
02:06:39,736 --> 02:06:41,567
It was transferred
to the account number...

1000
02:06:41,771 --> 02:06:44,069
...your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

1001
02:06:46,710 --> 02:06:50,111
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.

1002
02:06:52,816 --> 02:06:54,647
-Where?
-The Venice branch, of course.

1003
02:06:54,851 --> 02:06:56,079
St. Mark's Square.

1004
02:06:58,455 --> 02:07:00,150
<i>Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?</i>

1005
02:09:12,856 --> 02:09:14,016
I'll kill her!

1006
02:09:15,024 --> 02:09:16,218
Allow me.

1007
02:13:36,152 --> 02:13:38,120
I'm sorry, James.

1008
02:16:49,779 --> 02:16:52,509
<i>She had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.</i>

1009
02:16:52,715 --> 02:16:54,774
<i>They were very much in love.</i>

1010
02:16:55,184 --> 02:16:58,312
<i>He was kidnapped
by the organization behind Le Chiffre.</i>

1011
02:16:58,521 --> 02:17:03,481
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.

1012
02:17:03,693 --> 02:17:05,058
We should've picked up on it...

1013
02:17:05,261 --> 02:17:07,491
...but sometimes
we're so focused on our enemies...

1014
02:17:07,697 --> 02:17:09,221
...we forget to watch our friends.

1015
02:17:10,866 --> 02:17:12,731
<i>How are you doing?</i>

1016
02:17:13,069 --> 02:17:15,299
She left her cell phone.

1017
02:17:15,504 --> 02:17:17,870
She must have known I'd check it.

1018
02:17:18,674 --> 02:17:20,835
She knew you were you.

1019
02:17:21,911 --> 02:17:24,141
<i>-Well, at least this clears Mathis.
-No.</i>

1020
02:17:24,347 --> 02:17:25,974
-No?
-No.

1021
02:17:26,182 --> 02:17:28,673
We just proved that she's guilty,
not that he's innocent.

1022
02:17:28,884 --> 02:17:31,216
It could've been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

1023
02:17:32,021 --> 02:17:33,784
You don't trust anyone,
do you, James?

1024
02:17:33,989 --> 02:17:35,616
<i>No.</i>

1025
02:17:36,125 --> 02:17:38,389
Then you've learnt your lesson.

1026
02:17:39,195 --> 02:17:41,390
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

1027
02:17:42,131 --> 02:17:43,291
Will do.

1028
02:17:45,568 --> 02:17:46,933
If you do need time....

1029
02:17:47,136 --> 02:17:48,398
<i>Why should I need more time?</i>

1030
02:17:49,538 --> 02:17:52,803
The job's done,
and the bitch is dead.

1031
02:17:53,743 --> 02:17:55,540
James...

1032
02:17:56,178 --> 02:17:59,579
...did you ever ask yourself
why you weren't killed that night?

1033
02:18:00,182 --> 02:18:01,877
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

1034
02:18:02,084 --> 02:18:06,043
<i>She made a deal to spare your life
in exchange for the money.</i>

1035
02:18:06,255 --> 02:18:08,416
<i>I'm sure she hoped
they would let her live.</i>

1036
02:18:09,992 --> 02:18:12,984
But she must have known
she was going to her death.

1037
02:18:14,096 --> 02:18:17,031
<i>And now we'll never know
who was behind this.</i>

1038
02:18:17,233 --> 02:18:19,793
<i>The trail's gone cold.</i>

1039
02:19:47,323 --> 02:19:49,223
<i>-Hello.
-Mr. White?</i>

1040
02:19:49,425 --> 02:19:50,915
<i>We need to talk.</i>

1041
02:19:51,126 --> 02:19:52,991
Who is this?

1042
02:20:23,292 --> 02:20:25,283
The name's Bond.

1043
02:20:25,494 --> 02:20:27,428
James Bond.
