00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:56,030
<i>People will say I'm a monster
for what I've done</i>

2
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,802
<i>maybe they're right .</i>

3
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:03,791
<i>I always thought that I'd have more time.</i>

4
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,873
Dad.

5
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,685
<i>I'm sorry</i>

6
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:11,075
Peter?

7
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:30,697
- He likes to sleep with the light on.
- Mary, let's go.

8
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:35,688
Dad.

9
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:40,043
Be good

10
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:53,244
I have found a safe place for us to spend the night at Lake Geneva.

11
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:56,521
- Are you uploading it?
- To Roosevelt, all of it.

12
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:58,657
Just in case we...

13
00:03:00,356 --> 00:03:01,922
We're going to be fine, Mary.

14
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,445
Did you see his face?
He is never going to understand.

15
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:09,654
Mary, we've been through this.
Our life as we know it is over.

16
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:13,873
We will spend every day from now on
looking over our shoulders...

17
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:16,859
never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

18
00:03:16,943 --> 00:03:20,969
- He's just a little boy.
- I know, I know, It's going to be OK.

19
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:24,672
It's gonna be alright.

20
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:43,439
No rest for the weary, huh?
No, I'm afraid not.

21
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:46,605
Occupational hazard I guess.

22
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:48,805
What is it you're working on?

23
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:55,425
Er...just planning ahead.
Do you think I can speak with the pilot?

24
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:59,479
Something you need?
Perhaps, I can help.

25
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:03,457
I'd just like to radio ahead and make sure
everything's in order for when we land.

26
00:04:06,427 --> 00:04:10,273
I think we both know that's not an option,
Dr. Parker.

27
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:27,393
They say you're a genius.

28
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:32,059
Not if you think you can escape.

29
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,951
It's okay. It's okay.

30
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,017
I got you. Are you okay? Okay?

31
00:05:08,451 --> 00:05:12,391
I'm going to make you safe.
It's done. Breathe...Mary.

32
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:16,306
- Roosevelt.
- What? Roosevelt.

33
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:28,076
It's back up, back up.

34
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,958
It'll be alright okay.
Listen...to me.

35
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:44,970
Upload complete

36
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:45,006
What you got for me today,
New York?

37

<i>- A Police chase is in progress
- Alright, let's get to work.</i>

40
00:07:58,904 --> 00:08:02,212
Say hello to Aleksei Sytsevich.

41
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:35,185
- Spider-Man!
- Hello, pedestrians.

42
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:57,143
Knock, knock.
Mr. Criminal?

43
00:08:57,184 --> 00:09:00,312
Hey! My name is Spider-Man, you can call me
webhead, you can call me amazing,

44
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:02,597
just don't call me late for
dinner, you get it? Okay!

45
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,736
- Not a shaker? Are you a hugger?
- I'm a killer.

46
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,470
Warning! Plutonium-238 is a radioactive
material and is highly explosive.

47
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:18,613
Excuse me.
There's more room on the sidewalk.

48
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:24,080
Dodge, please, dodge!
A little help? A little help, please.

49
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:29,819
You're having problem with your gun?
Let me help you out with that.

50
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,160
Too much work.

51
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:39,060
Er...this is bad,
I'm gonna be right back.

52
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:45,952
Heads, up, watch out. Wooo!

53
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,839
Okay, okay, there you go. You okay?

54
00:09:49,864 --> 00:09:51,493
- You alright?
- You're Spider-Man!

55
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:54,931
Costume gives it away, huh? Look,
this looks pretty important, Max.

56
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:58,082
- Max? How do you know my name?
- It's written on your badge.

57
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:01,629
- I'm a nobody.
- Hey! You're not a nobody, you're somebody.

58
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:03,606
Lick that. Alright, listen to me.

Gotcha, gotcha,

Oh, come on.

Hey wait, come back here.

69
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:22,775
Gotcha.

70
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:36,223
Hey I'm sorry, I'm running a bit
late, I got stuck in some traffic.

71
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:39,930
Your timing is terrible. It started already,
I know I'm sorry where are you?

72

First on Broadway, second on Broadway, third

<i>this years' Valedictorian, please
welcome...Gwen Stacy.</i>

80
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,862
Good morning, esteemed faculty
and families of my fellow graduates.

81
00:12:32,914 --> 00:12:35,555
It's an honor to be standing up
here today.

82
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:46,642
Hello...I told you,
I'm running a bit late.

83
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:49,526
I saw that, Spider.
Really?

84
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:52,105
I know that we all think we're immortal.

85
00:12:52,174 --> 00:12:56,038
We're supposed to feel
that way, we're graduating

86
00:12:56,331 --> 00:12:59,121
but like our brief
4 years in high school...

87
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:04,150
what makes life valuable, is
that it doesn't last forever.

88
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:07,930
What makes it precious is that it ends.

89
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:11,576
We know that now more than ever.

90
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,742
And I say it...

91
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,022
today of all days

92
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:19,375
is to remind us that time is luck.

93
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:26,339
So don't waste it living someone elses' life.

94
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:29,413
Make yours count for something.

95
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:33,269
Fight for what matters to you,
no matter what.

96
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:35,941
'cause even if we fall short...

97
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,662
what better way is there to live?

98
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:39,921
Alright

99
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:53,857
I'll take that, that's my rule.

100
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:03,256
This is not end, Spider

101
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:27,013
Peter Parker

102
00:14:27,473 --> 00:14:29,665
I think I know that guy.

103
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,524
Peter Parker.

104
00:14:34,057 --> 00:14:35,870
Sorry.

105
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,568
Wait, do that again, do that again.

106
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,840
Oh, Pete...Lord says...I almost
stole my car up again over myself.

107
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:57,736
- I'd like to have seen that too.
- No, no, no, this is for you.

108
00:14:57,761 --> 00:15:01,953
- Oh, I am so proud of you.
- You earned it. Sweetheart I'm so proud of you.

109
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:06,640
- I know the first thing your Uncle Ben would say...
- Yea, I know too.

110
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:09,768
"You gotta hurry up, the party's over.
You gotta get a job."

111
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:14,654
Alright, then the second thing he would say:
"Don't just follow the path. Make your own trail."

112
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,782
- Ralph Waldo Emerson...?
- No...

113
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:20,927
- What do you mean no?
- Ben told me he made it up.

114
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:23,842
You really did learn something here.

115
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:29,490
I wish your uncle could have been here.

116
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:34,572
Yea, me too...and my folks.

117
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:37,539
Yea, yea.

118
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:46,615
Alright, you can go.
Come on, and be right back.

119
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:49,356
OK, guys, get together,
get together right now.

120
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,696
- A quick one alright, Cheese...
- Cheese...

121
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:57,418
OK, just gimme 2 seconds.

122
00:15:57,486 --> 00:15:59,973
Don't go too far.
Good to see you. Alright.

123
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:06,973
Did your traffic jam have anything
to do with the Russian mob...

124
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:10,059
and machine guns by any chance?

125
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:13,304
- Why don't you just tell me? what I gonna do?
- I was about to...right after you speech.

126
00:16:13,468 --> 00:16:16,725
- Gwen, honey, family photo.
- Okay.

127
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:20,424
- You coming to dim sum?
- You can't keep me away.

128
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,979
- It's at 8 o'clock. Don't be late.
- I will be OK.

129
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:28,345
And I am going to do my speech for you.

130
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:33,613
- All night, I want to hear it all night long.
- Over and over again, all night long.

131
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:38,685
- That was pretty good.
- Peter, join us.

132
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:44,059
I got to find my aunt, I gotta find my
aunt but I'm going to catch up later. Thank you.

133
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:53,174
<i>You're going to make enemies.
People will get hurt.</i>

134
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:56,486
<i>So will you please promise me something, OK ?</i>

135
00:16:56,695 --> 00:17:00,921
Leave Gwen out of it.

136
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,039
<i>Promise me that.</i>

137
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,618
Peter's outside.

138
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:29,694
Peter.

139
00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:34,467
What is it?

140
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:38,769
What's wrong? Are you alright?

141
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:41,324
I don't know what I'm doing.

142
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,874
It's my father, isn't it?

143
00:17:45,418 --> 00:17:48,900
Yea, I see him everywhere I go.

144
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:53,537
I can't...I don't know what to do.
I can't get him out of my head.

145
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:56,647
- Yea but we'd talked about this.
- I know...Gwen

146
00:17:56,712 --> 00:17:58,377
It's not his choice.

147
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:03,071
Gwen, I promised him that
I would keep away from you

148
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:06,029
and now I'm gonna come
eat dinner with your family.

149
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:09,176
How can I do this?
What does this make me?

150
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:11,890
I don't know, what does that make you?

151
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:14,752
It makes me not able
to live with myself.

152
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,767
- I thought that it made you love me.
- I do love you.

153
00:18:23,496 --> 00:18:25,348
I love you.

154
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:29,314
Then why isn't that enough, huh?

155
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:35,050
Because what if something happens to you,
just like it happened to him because of me.

156
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:38,496
No, wait, wait, wait.

157
00:18:38,555 --> 00:18:40,536
I cannot let that happen.

158
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:44,453
Listen to me, you're Spider-Man...

159
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,352
and I love that

160
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:51,889
but I love Peter Parker more.

161
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:56,670
That's worth it to me.

162
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:59,248
I can't lose you too.

163
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:04,122
Is it because you can't lose me,
we can't be together?

164
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:08,822
Who's there to work out for, Peter?

165
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:13,078
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

166
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:20,320
Wow, you have done this to me...

167
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:24,243
again and again, Peter.

168
00:19:24,987 --> 00:19:27,390
I can't live like this.

169
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:31,740
I break up with you.

170
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:36,134
I break up with you.

171
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:17,709
<i>Good morning, New Yorkers.</i>

172
00:20:17,774 --> 00:20:20,702
<i>Looking for another beautiful day here in the city.</i>

173
00:20:22,237 --> 00:20:25,450
<i>The steady increase in sightings of
Spider-Man has sparked a national debate...</i>

174
00:20:25,514 --> 00:20:28,074
<i>over the role of vigilantes
in America's crime fighting .</i>

175
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:31,930
<i>- How about that Spider-Man...
-  Last night on Manhattan bridge he saved a dozen lives.</i>

176
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,850
<i>We want to hear your calls.</i>

177
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:37,580
<i>I think without Spider-Man,
there'll be no hope for this city..</i>

178
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:42,017
<i>Who do you think paid the bill for all the
damages he caused, huh? It's you and me, taxpayer!</i>

179
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,037
Did you make this?
Yea

180
00:20:44,062 --> 00:20:48,655
This is a wind turbine.
You made this? No way!

181
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:50,779
This is amazing.

182
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:55,093
It's good as new, right? I'll walk you home.

183
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:57,017
- What's your name?
- Jorge.

184
00:20:57,403 --> 00:21:00,011
Jorge, I'm Spider-Man.

185
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:02,809
<i>I don't feel like my kids are
safe with him out there,</i>

186
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:06,090
<i>get out of the way and
let the police do their job.</i>

187
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:10,054
<i>Some folks think that there
might be more than one Spider-man.</i>

188
00:21:11,512 --> 00:21:14,748
<i>What do you think,
one guy or many?</i>

189
00:21:14,938 --> 00:21:17,591
I'd love to know who's behind that mask.

190
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:20,114
- Hey, nice outfit.
- Thanks.

191
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:23,829
<i>We have a caller on the line named
Max, he said he knows Spider-Man.</i>

192
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:27,361
<i>Listen, I'm upset...Spider-Man
to me is being misunderstood.</i>

193
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,732
<i>He's a very, very good person,
He's protecting us.</i>

194
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:33,662
<i>Not only that, he saved my life, one time,
and we sort of became best friends.</i>

195
00:21:35,485 --> 00:21:38,003
- How much?
- You're that Spider guy!

196
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,964
I'm Spider-Bad.

197
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,518
I'm Spider-Bad.

198
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:49,862
<i>This Spider-Man guy, he's not
the police, he's not a fireman.</i>

199
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:53,245
<i>What gives him the right,
to get involved in other people's business</i>

200
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:28,129
Peter, honey, can I come in?

201
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:30,790
No!

202
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:33,463
Peter, the final starts at 9, honey.

203
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:37,072
And you said you'd take my car
into the shop b'coz it keeps dying, remember?

204
00:22:37,342 --> 00:22:40,824
Gimme a second Aunt May, I'm gonna
get the door, just gimme a second.

205
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:43,123
Please just let me in, alright?

206
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:47,755
<i>The final is at 9, are you going
to take my car to the shop?</i>

207
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,666
No, you can't come in. Stay outside,
I'm so naked.

208
00:22:52,398 --> 00:22:56,532
You said you're gonna take my car
into the shop because...

209
00:22:56,557 --> 00:22:59,592
- Are you alright?
- Yea. I'm okay.

210
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,757
I'm just...I'm very naked right now.

211
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:06,678
- What happened to your face, it's filthy!
- It is? Yes.

212
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:11,072
Oh yea, yea, I was cleaning
the chimney.

213
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,904
- We have no chimney.
- What?

214
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,855
- You're late.
- I know, I'm late.

215
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:17,544
Downstairs...Now!

216
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:21,023
- Alright, I'm leaving!
- I'm naked here.

217
00:23:21,244 --> 00:23:24,582
Morning. I love you.
I love you too. Hurry up.

218
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:09,065
Ho ho ho, look who's here?
Spidey!

219
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:13,030
How was your morning?
Aces, Max, aces.

220
00:24:13,106 --> 00:24:16,898
I've been out saving the world,
protecting everybody.

221
00:24:16,962 --> 00:24:20,134
Listen, isn't it somebody's birthday today?

222
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:25,632
That's why you're here.
You remembered my birthday.

223
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:32,245
All the crime fighting you've been doing
and you still take time to come visit little old me, Max.

224
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:34,358
That's...it's amazing.

225
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:39,417
But...of course you would,
why won't you visit me?

226
00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:41,715
We're best friend.

227
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:47,668
What are you doing?
You made me a cake?

228
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,205
People don't get the chance to see
these all small kind things you do for people.

229
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,617
I know what they say about you in the
press but it doesn't matter to me

230
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:57,258
because I know the real you,
because you're amazing.

231
00:24:57,327 --> 00:25:00,590
Wow, that's what the press needs.

232
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:03,718
They should call you "The
Amazing Spider-Man."

233
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:07,827
You like that, Spidey?
I like it a lot, Max.

234
00:25:07,864 --> 00:25:13,725
Good...because today is going
to be amazing.

235
00:25:16,387 --> 00:25:17,920
Circuit 39.

236
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:24,528
I'm not late, Harvey,
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

237
00:25:24,553 --> 00:25:28,666
I just wanna know if you can find another
waitress to replace me

238
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:31,363
because I start my training
rounds at the hospital.

239
00:25:31,394 --> 00:25:35,945
Don't mention this to Peter,
I don't want him to know because he worries.

240
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:41,564
Yea, yea, okay, you got it.
Double shift on Thursday. Okay bye.

241
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,397
- Who was that?
- Harvey.

242
00:25:47,657 --> 00:25:50,716
- Another double shift, huh?
- Sometimes.

243
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:53,272
I got nothing else to do,
I like the girls,

244
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:56,838
I miss Ben gives me a little
extra in the cookie jar.

245
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:02,110
I sold another, another couple of photos
to the Bugle so that outa help.

246
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:05,121
Yea, what really help if that guy
would pay you a fair wage.

247
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:09,500
Oh, James? James would pay me some fair wages,
if it was 1961, he would pay me a fair wage.

248
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,834
Hey, Hey, wait. What are you doing?
What are you doing?

249
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:16,584
- I'm doing my laundry.
- No, I do the laundry.

250
00:26:16,753 --> 00:26:19,872
It's my job, I've been doing your
laundry since you were 6 years old.

251
00:26:19,897 --> 00:26:24,433
I understand that, I'm in college now,
it's time that I took care of my own dirty underwear.

252
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:27,327
The last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red.

253
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:32,437
That was a mistake, cause'
I was washing...the...the American flag, my...can you just please...

254
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:34,797
No one washes the flag.

255
00:26:34,866 --> 00:26:38,806
I do and I wont anymore, forget it, fine,
can I just do my...it's just underwear!

256
00:26:38,975 --> 00:26:43,358
This is my laundry, my home,
my machine. Back off, eat your breakfast.

257
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:47,903
Alright laundry sheriff.
I'll do it later.

258
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:51,553
- I'll do it.
- No, forget it. No, I'll do it some other time, forget it.

259
00:26:53,372 --> 00:26:55,448
- Excuse me.
- Idiot.

260
00:26:57,227 --> 00:26:59,140
I do not get it.

261
00:27:01,293 --> 00:27:04,296
A lot of jam. Come on, come on.

262
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:07,087
- Watch it, buddy.
- Hey, let's go!

263
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,326
<i>Oscorp Industries is proud to announce...</i>

264
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,997
<i>the world's first electromagnetic

265
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:22,995

- "D" line trains were so slow, sir.

269
00:27:35,248 --> 00:27:39,220
Don't you realise that Oscorp is now
responsible for the entire city energy supply?

270
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:42,490
The designs for the power grid
and they use a lot of them

271
00:27:42,498 --> 00:27:46,859
and I noticed that in those power grids were the designs by me.

272
00:27:46,884 --> 00:27:52,323
You designed them? Sure you did
and I'm Spider-Man.

273

You're no Spider-Man. He's the ...?

This's exciting. This guy dress like spiderman.

It must be cool, huh, to have the
whole world look at you like that.

293

You know Spider-Man saved my life one time.

294
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:11,025
Of all the people in the whole
city, he saved me.

295
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:13,757
He said he needed me.

296
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:16,112
That must be really...

00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:44,824
Welcome home.

301
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:57,815
It's dark in there.

302
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:03,429
Your eyes will adjust.
It's better this way.

303
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,011
Dad.

304
00:30:39,675 --> 00:30:44,210
This is not how I imagined
I will die.

305
00:30:44,306 --> 00:30:48,711
Looking at my son and,
seeing a stranger.

306
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,629
You had such potential, Harry.

307
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:00,259
Such fierce intelligence
and yet you thrown it all away.

308
00:31:00,284 --> 00:31:02,750
You threw me away.

309
00:31:03,951 --> 00:31:07,682
You kicked me off to boarding
school when I was 11.

310
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:11,363
On my 16th birthday...

311
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:15,690
you sent me Scotch
or one of your assistants did.

312
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:18,785
I'm pretty sure because the card read:

313
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,834
With compliments, Norman Osborn.

314
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:27,731
I don't expect forgiveness from you anymore

315
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:31,529
and you know what? I don't believe in miracles.

316
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:34,843
How could you possibly understand...

317
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:38,571
that your childhood had to be sacrificed

318
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,050
for something greater?

319
00:31:41,258 --> 00:31:45,130
Not just for me, for you!

320
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,361
Have your hands started to twitch yet?

321
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,285
When you lay awake...
and you feel it coming...

322
00:31:57,346 --> 00:32:02,746
hiding under the skin...
waiting to show itself...

323
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:07,992
to show you who you really are...

324
00:32:11,404 --> 00:32:14,825
Retroviral Hyperplasia.

325
00:32:17,124 --> 00:32:19,136
I never told you...

326
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:22,390
that's genetic.

327
00:32:23,968 --> 00:32:26,393
Our disease,

328
00:32:26,418 --> 00:32:29,411
the Osborn curse

329
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:32,647
and it began at your age.

330
00:32:34,016 --> 00:32:35,872
Let me see it.

331
00:32:36,876 --> 00:32:39,939
Your hand, give it to me.

332
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:50,692
The greatest inheritance
I can give you

333
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:54,024
is not nearly money.

334
00:32:54,120 --> 00:33:02,352
is this...a solemn total volume of my work
everything I did to stay alive.

335
00:33:03,305 --> 00:33:07,003
Maybe you can succeed where I failed.

336
00:33:30,212 --> 00:33:35,685
<i>Mr. Norman Osborn, the
legendary founder and CEO of Oscorp Industries has died.</i>

337
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,332
<i>The Osborn estate has confirmed</i>

338
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:41,415
<i>he is survived by his only son, Harry
Osborn, who is the sole heir</i>

339
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,170
<i>of the Oscorp corporate empire</i>
Harry

340
00:33:44,205 --> 00:33:48,331
<i>Osborn fundamentaly changed the medical
profession's approach to human healing...</i>

341
00:33:48,425 --> 00:33:50,908
<i>and affected the lives of millions.</i>

342
00:33:50,944 --> 00:33:55,302
<i>I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought.</i>

343
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:58,440
<i>"We can do better.
We should do better."</i>

344
00:33:58,475 --> 00:34:04,080
<i>Einstein said the world cannot be changed
without changing our thinking</i>

345
00:34:04,115 --> 00:34:06,930
<i>but change isn't just a slogan.</i>

346
00:34:06,955 --> 00:34:12,691
<i>It begins with hard work. Change begins
with persistence and commitment.</i>

347
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:16,056
Mr. Osborn changed the world

348
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:20,978
and now it's up to each of us to ensure that
his hopes and dreams remain alive

349
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:22,805
but not today.

350
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:25,720
- Today...
- Hello?

351
00:34:25,948 --> 00:34:28,424
<i>- Is this Gwen Stacy?
- Yes, it's, who's calling?</i>

352
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:32,841
<i>I'm calling from the Oxford scholar
program. We've some exciting news.</i>

353
00:34:37,814 --> 00:34:39,669
Oh, Dillon, you stay here.

354
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:42,946
There's a current flow problem in genomics
lab. Why don't you stay and take a look at that.

355
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:45,949
It's my birthday. Everybody else
is leaving, why do I have to stay?

356
00:34:45,977 --> 00:34:49,832
- Because you're special,
- Smythe, I mean Mr. Smythe...

357
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:51,611
Happy birthday.

358
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,939
<i>Bio electrogenesis.</i>

359
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:02,854
<i>The generation of electricity by
living organisms...</i>

360
00:35:02,889 --> 00:35:05,180
Hey guys.

361
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:08,201
Someone loves a party.

362
00:35:08,748 --> 00:35:11,031
You're just a little sick.

363
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:14,059
I got your medicine.

364
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:20,321
And on my birthday.
After all I put together for this company.

365
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:23,125
<i>Warning.</i>

366
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:26,498
<i>- Error in sector 5A
- I know, maybe it's just the...</i>

367
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:31,050
Did you know it's my birthday, Kari? Could
you sing "Happy Birthday" for me?

368
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:33,232
I'll just have to sing for myself.

369
00:35:33,691 --> 00:35:38,428
<i>Gilbert! What? It's Max. Can you shut
down power in sector 32, please?</i>

370
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:41,712
<i>- Forget it I'm out the door.
- What do you mean, Listen I'm up here, it's dangerous.</i>

371
00:35:41,737 --> 00:35:43,504
<i>- Sorry, Max
- Hello?</i>

372
00:35:45,452 --> 00:35:49,695
I'll do it myself
and I'll sing to myself.

373
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:57,492
Happy Birthday...to me.
Happy Birthday...dear Max...

374
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:10,929
Happy Birthday...

375
00:36:12,531 --> 00:36:13,031
to me.

376
00:36:49,218 --> 00:36:52,277
<i>System restored.
Have a nice day.</i>

377
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:59,989
Harry, Oscorps has been under intense public scrutiny
in the wake of Dr. Connors' recent breach of trust.

378
00:37:00,002 --> 00:37:04,788
You mean, people are pisssed off because he
tried to turn everyone in N.Y city into giant lizards?

379
00:37:06,618 --> 00:37:08,144
Given that...

380
00:37:08,379 --> 00:37:12,013
all the animal hybrid program he
was involved in were destroyed...

381
00:37:12,448 --> 00:37:15,423
to restore investor confidence.

382
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:18,898
That is the Osborn way.

383
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:22,709
Whoever's inconvenient around
here, just get rid of it, right?

384
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:26,311
Much of that scrutiny may fall on
you now.

385
00:37:26,534 --> 00:37:31,024
- We felt that plausible deniability was your best option...
- Sure, sure, I get it.

386
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:36,055
20-year-old kid.
200 billion dollar company.

387
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:38,168
What was dad thinking?

388
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:41,552
I mean you're all lawyers...right?

389
00:37:42,197 --> 00:37:46,148
Surely someone must have questioned his
sanity in the end.

390
00:37:46,536 --> 00:37:49,870
Someone must have thought about having
him declared legally incompetent.

391
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:52,879
would have made this conversation
a lot easier.

392
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:55,211
- Harry...
- It's Mr. Osborn.

393
00:37:56,217 --> 00:37:57,936
We're not friends.

394
00:38:03,754 --> 00:38:05,387
Hi.

395
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:11,948
You were his assistant, right?

396
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:18,900
- What is your name?
- Felicia. Felicia.

397
00:38:20,242 --> 00:38:26,128
From now on, everybody at this table
will explore? Felicia

398
00:38:26,235 --> 00:38:29,983
because Felicia works for me.

399
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:33,643
Would anybody like to speak up?

400
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:39,320
Well good then, you can all
keep your job for a little longer.

401
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,681
Sir... There's a Peter Parker...

402
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:54,753
Felicia, I want to see every
file on this list.

403
00:38:56,082 --> 00:38:57,676
Every single one.

404
00:39:05,263 --> 00:39:10,200
Peter Parker.
It's like seeing a ghost.

405
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:12,649
Hey, Harry.

406
00:39:13,044 --> 00:39:14,876
Random.

407
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:18,336
- 10 years.
- It's 8.

408
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,538
Close.

409
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:24,879
- What's up?
- It's on the news, man.

410
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:28,049
I heard about your dad and I wanted
to come and...

411
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:32,504
see you, check it out, see how you're doing.

412
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,668
I'm...umm...I'm with some people.

413
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:41,344
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

414
00:39:41,665 --> 00:39:45,402
I'm sorry, I don't want to intrude,
I know it has been a long time and

415
00:39:45,437 --> 00:39:48,287
I kind of know exactly what
you're going through right now.

416
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:51,445
You were so there for me when my
parents...

417
00:39:51,616 --> 00:39:54,212
That's why I'm here for you.

418
00:39:54,884 --> 00:39:56,515
Thank you.

419
00:39:58,736 --> 00:40:01,197
It's good to see you man.

420
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,476
Good to see you.

421
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:07,009
Sorry about your dad.

422
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,127
You've got your braces off.

423
00:40:16,189 --> 00:40:19,978
and now there's nothing to distract from your...?

424
00:40:23,064 --> 00:40:24,449
There it is.

425
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:27,106
There it is.

426
00:40:27,552 --> 00:40:30,124
Does someone dry your
hair every morning?

427
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:35,193
Umm...you know...one of my main
servants hold the hair dryer

428
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:36,493
but I work the comb.

429
00:40:36,718 --> 00:40:41,536
Okay, so at least I'm not completely
helpless.

430
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:52,405
After graduation I went
to Brazil and Singapore.

431
00:40:52,457 --> 00:40:56,541
- That's right...and then Europe, you know, I went to Europe.
- I saw you.

432
00:40:58,154 --> 00:40:59,364
What do you mean you saw me.

433
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,718
I saw you in some magazine with some French
supermodel, you know what I'm talking about?

434
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:10,538
- Yea, yea, dude, the whole model thing is so exhausting.
- I know.

435
00:41:12,028 --> 00:41:13,691
What?

436
00:41:14,169 --> 00:41:16,071
You got a lady?

437
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:22,524
Er...that's the question.

438
00:41:23,075 --> 00:41:24,788
That's the question.

439
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:29,236
- Nobody?
- No, I don't.

440
00:41:29,858 --> 00:41:32,988
Yea, I don't know...

441
00:41:33,363 --> 00:41:38,500
it's a, er...I don't know, it's complicated.

442
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:41,761
Yea, I don't do complicated.

443
00:41:42,809 --> 00:41:45,861
So what's her name? Who is she?

444
00:41:45,927 --> 00:41:49,167
Her name is Gwen, Gwen Stacy.

445
00:41:49,622 --> 00:41:52,908
- Gwen Stacy?
- She works for you.

446
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:54,779
Really? She works for me?

447
00:41:54,814 --> 00:41:58,428
- She's an intern at Oscorp.
- Is she a model employee?

448
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:05,347
You know, when my father sent away me I tried to
forget everything about this place.

449
00:42:06,796 --> 00:42:09,059
I guess that kind of includes you.

450
00:42:12,472 --> 00:42:15,470
You don't have to explain anything to me, man.

451
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,694
We both got dumped.

452
00:42:21,554 --> 00:42:24,297
Did you ever figure out why your parents bailed?

453
00:42:27,424 --> 00:42:30,015
My dad left a briefcase.

454
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:32,886
Thats all I got, a briefcase full of junk.

455
00:42:32,922 --> 00:42:37,536
- Whatever, I don't know. I try not to think about it.
- How's that working out for you?

456
00:42:37,737 --> 00:42:39,594
Perfectly.

457
00:42:45,368 --> 00:42:48,513
Dude, that's horrible.

458
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:50,549
It's just the wrist. It's
just all in the wrist, buddy.

459
00:42:50,862 --> 00:42:54,383
<i>You can do it with some strength.</i>

460
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:58,790
Yea, right you got to admit though,
things have gotten a little crazy around here man.

461
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:01,338
<i>Giant lizards, and...</i>

462
00:43:01,573 --> 00:43:03,890
Spider-Guy.

463
00:43:05,843 --> 00:43:08,652
Just one guy,
just one Spider-Man,

464
00:43:08,778 --> 00:43:12,597
or woman.
We don't know...for sure.

465
00:43:13,035 --> 00:43:16,533
Whatever dude. What's with Spandex
rescuing kittens from trees?

466
00:43:17,414 --> 00:43:19,506
So impressed.

467
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:23,414
- The guy like to give people hope.
- For what?

468
00:43:23,452 --> 00:43:26,468
Maybe eventually everything's gonna
be alright.

469
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:29,528
I wish I had time for eventually.

470
00:43:32,886 --> 00:43:37,616
- Who was it?
- Maxwell Dillon, electrical engineer.

471
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:40,592
No associates or friends to speak of.

472
00:43:40,628 --> 00:43:44,186
He submitted specs for the grid,
that we...appropriated...

473
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:47,440
caused it invisible.

474
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:52,444
Wall Street is nervous enough of
that child, Harry, taking over.

475
00:43:52,479 --> 00:43:54,787
We got to find a way to get him out.

476
00:43:54,822 --> 00:43:59,266
In the meantime if the press gets hold of this
accident, our stock will cradle.

477
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:03,735
So make sure that this Mr. Dillon
stays invisible.

478
00:44:04,886 --> 00:44:08,249
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

479
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:16,501
Hey.

480
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,482
Move!

481
00:45:58,024 --> 00:45:58,524
Hey!

482
00:46:04,682 --> 00:46:06,425
You look amazing.

483
00:46:07,368 --> 00:46:10,523
I'm sorry for this spontaneous...?
it's kind of...

484
00:46:10,558 --> 00:46:15,264
No, I...spontaneous is alright,
you know.

485
00:46:15,336 --> 00:46:19,644
Well, I just figured it was time,

486
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:23,691
you know...time we try to be friends.

487
00:46:27,657 --> 00:46:30,473
Friends, yea, that's...

488
00:46:31,224 --> 00:46:32,794
great.

489
00:46:32,828 --> 00:46:35,087
Just don't want this to be complicated.

490
00:46:35,122 --> 00:46:39,331
- I just said that to someone I hate complicated.
- Keep it simple.

491
00:46:40,235 --> 00:46:45,421
Okay great, great, yea, yea, alright
but I mean...

492
00:46:46,777 --> 00:46:52,060
if we were to be friends, I think
we gotta establish some ground rules.

493
00:46:52,095 --> 00:46:54,073
- Some ground rules?
- Yes, some ground rules,

494
00:46:54,616 --> 00:46:57,444
- Like that.
- Like what?

495
00:46:58,642 --> 00:47:01,218
Look...look, that laugh, that laugh.

496
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:03,001
That's off the table.

497
00:47:03,036 --> 00:47:07,298
- My laugh's off the table?
- You gotta figure out a more annoying laugh.

498
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:11,220
That's still adorable.

499
00:47:11,479 --> 00:47:15,085
That was not adorable.
What're you doing...

500
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:19,901
- Okay, I've got a ground rule.
- Oh, you, what? What's it.

501
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:23,243
Er...don't tell me that I look amazing

502
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:27,594
with your big brown doe eyes, OK?

503
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:30,589
I'm really serious about that one.

504
00:47:31,553 --> 00:47:33,485
- Oh no...
- What?

505
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,963
- I've just figured out the next ground rule.
- What?

506
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:38,726
No more of this.

507
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:42,791
- No more...no more this nose rub that you do.
- This? Don't think I've to?

508
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,285
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

509
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,400
This is killing me, I gotta...you just
stay in my face with my ground rules, I'm out.

510
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,031
Come on!

511
00:47:53,232 --> 00:47:55,703
First we get ice cream, then I'm out.

512
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:36,290
Umm, yea, I did that...

513
00:48:36,415 --> 00:48:41,883
and I got completely addicted to this
place that has Korean meatballs.

514
00:48:41,944 --> 00:48:44,243
- Yea... Have you been there?
- No, no... It's mind-blowing.

515
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:46,845
That place is at 6th, I know,
you love it there.

516
00:48:49,197 --> 00:48:50,707
How do you know that?

517
00:48:53,685 --> 00:48:55,488
How do you know I love it there?

518
00:48:56,438 --> 00:48:57,538
Cos' umm...

519
00:49:00,032 --> 00:49:01,707
Cos' you told me.

520
00:49:04,872 --> 00:49:06,885
It just opened last month.

521
00:49:10,561 --> 00:49:12,980
Have you been following me?

522
00:49:17,953 --> 00:49:21,056
I knew it. How often?

523
00:49:24,826 --> 00:49:27,806
Just once a day, sometimes.

524
00:49:30,112 --> 00:49:31,830
Sometimes more.

525
00:49:37,411 --> 00:49:40,175
Oh boy, why?

526
00:49:44,154 --> 00:49:47,291
- You trying to keep me safe?
- Yea.

527
00:49:48,598 --> 00:49:52,575
No, that's the closest
I can get still being with you.

528
00:50:04,654 --> 00:50:06,876
I'm moving to England.

529
00:50:15,198 --> 00:50:17,422
- What?
- Yea.

530
00:50:18,876 --> 00:50:23,134
I have a, um...a first scholarship to Oxford

531
00:50:23,296 --> 00:50:25,034
in molecular medicine

532
00:50:25,059 --> 00:50:28,835
and it's between me and this other kid and
there's this oral exam we've to do

533
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:32,841
and he's like a freshman
in college but he's 14

534
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:36,727
and it could be him
but might be me, I hope it's me

535
00:50:36,763 --> 00:50:40,180
and then I, I gotta move to England

536
00:50:42,675 --> 00:50:44,516
and I'm really excited.

537
00:50:45,985 --> 00:50:47,935
That's...er...

538
00:50:50,518 --> 00:50:52,240
England?

539
00:51:51,825 --> 00:51:54,131
Station, I need a 10-85.

540
00:51:54,296 --> 00:51:57,815
Send out the units to the
southend corner of Duffy Square.

541
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:03,597
Everybody get out of the way, please.
Get out of the way!

542
00:52:03,443 --> 00:52:07,001
Sir, get your hands away
from the cable, right now!

543
00:52:07,004 --> 00:52:09,599
Sir, get your hands away from the cables!

544
00:52:09,634 --> 00:52:11,913
Let me see your hands, please!

545
00:52:13,894 --> 00:52:16,064
You stay right where you are.
Do not move.

546
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:18,998
Freeze! Get down, on the ground!

547
00:52:36,745 --> 00:52:38,565
Get down on the ground, now!

548
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:41,555
- Stop.
- Get down on the ground, now!

549
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,415
It's not my fault. Stop.

550
00:52:44,487 --> 00:52:47,098
Please...

551
00:52:52,193 --> 00:52:53,964
My goodness.

552
00:52:55,016 --> 00:52:57,802
They see me...they see me...

553
00:52:59,637 --> 00:53:03,083
They see me...they see me..

554
00:53:15,298 --> 00:53:18,047
- On the ground, now!
- No...stop. Don't do that.

555
00:53:18,082 --> 00:53:19,735
Please.

556
00:53:19,848 --> 00:53:22,264
- It's over, freak.
- Wait, it's not my fault.

557
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,517
It's not my fault.

558
00:53:27,286 --> 00:53:29,515
I said, stop!

559
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:37,924
I'm glad you're not one of those
cops that ride a horse.

560
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,220
All team members...hold your fire and wait for
my call.

561
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,716
All unit Hold your fire, I repeat, hold
your fire and stay down.

562
00:53:55,551 --> 00:53:59,219
- Stop, stop it!
- Yo, Sparkle!

563
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:02,610
Hey...how are you doing?

564
00:54:02,775 --> 00:54:06,961
- It's you?
- Yea, I know it's me, who are you?

565
00:54:07,556 --> 00:54:11,975
- You don't remember me?
- No, should I?

566
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,208
I walked into the street, the car
almost hit me. You swung me up.

567
00:54:16,244 --> 00:54:20,003
You saved me.
You said you needed me.

568
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:24,178
- The guy, you're the guy with the blue prints...
- Yes, blue prints.

569
00:54:24,212 --> 00:54:28,937
Yes, I remember you, of course I remember
you, you're my eyes and ears.

570
00:54:29,106 --> 00:54:32,000
- Er...what's your name again?
- How could you forget me?

571
00:54:32,165 --> 00:54:35,770
- Oh, I do, I know it, I know it, don't tell me...
- It's Max. Is it Max?

572
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:37,146
Yes.

573
00:54:37,282 --> 00:54:41,294
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you with the...you look different.

574
00:54:41,328 --> 00:54:43,081
How are you?

575
00:54:43,115 --> 00:54:47,591
- I don't know what's going on with me.
- I can see, I...I believe you.

576
00:54:47,971 --> 00:54:52,939
It's strange...the power that
I got so much.

577
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:55,130
I got so much anger.

578
00:54:55,164 --> 00:54:58,175
Excuse me. I can see that, I can see you
don't want to be here, I can see you're scared

579
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,883
cos' you don't know what's happening to you.
I can see that you don't want to hurt anybody.

580
00:55:02,281 --> 00:55:04,890
- It's going to be alright.
- I got a clear shot, standing by.

581
00:55:04,925 --> 00:55:06,847
- I don't want them shooting me anymore.
- They're not going to shoot you.

582
00:55:06,883 --> 00:55:08,850
You guys, this is my buddy Max.

583
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:13,343
I told you about Max.
No one shoots at Max!

584
00:55:13,398 --> 00:55:16,559
You and me, fancy you and me talking. Whoa...
Stay right there, stay right there.

585
00:55:16,584 --> 00:55:19,487
Just be careful with the grid,
it's the electricity.

586
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:23,440
I just...I just wanted them to see me.

587
00:55:23,605 --> 00:55:25,923
<i>If he makes a move, you take that shot.</i>

588
00:55:25,958 --> 00:55:30,303
How about you come with me, go somewhere we can talk,
away from all these people...okay?

589
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:34,572
No, no...stop!

590
00:55:57,482 --> 00:56:00,312
Spidey...Spidey...

591
00:56:02,374 --> 00:56:04,447
You stupid freak!

592
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:12,640
dummy!

593
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,640
<i>He lied to me, he shot me...</i>

594
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,404
Shut up.

595
00:56:25,129 --> 00:56:27,347
You're so selfish.

596
00:56:27,372 --> 00:56:29,259
Stay with me Max.

597
00:56:29,294 --> 00:56:32,016
- You set me up.
- No...I didn't set you up.

598
00:56:32,551 --> 00:56:36,163
- You lied to me.
- No, I'm trying to help you, let me help you.

599
00:57:30,807 --> 00:57:32,837
It's my birthday.

600
00:57:32,871 --> 00:57:36,503
Now it's time for me to light my
candles.

601
00:58:53,317 --> 00:58:55,559
Do we have visual on Spider-Man?

602
00:58:56,453 --> 00:58:59,315
Does anyone...have visual on Spider-Man?

603
00:59:09,153 --> 00:59:11,770
That's enough.

604
00:59:12,495 --> 00:59:15,627
- Mike. Big John.
- Nice job!

605
00:59:15,664 --> 00:59:20,272
Nice work fellas. It's a
pleasure doing business with you.

606
00:59:27,378 --> 00:59:29,961
Spider-Man...

607
00:59:35,891 --> 00:59:37,657
England?

608
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:40,494
Really?

609
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:51,771
Good talk.

610
01:00:09,751 --> 01:00:14,203
Our coverage of this breaking story begins
with Jessica Abo at the scene.

611
01:00:14,228 --> 01:00:18,214
That's right. We're standing here with two eyewitnesses
who are going to tell us what they just saw.

612
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:21,846
So tell us. How do you think Spider-Man did it.
How do you think he beat this creature.

613
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:25,974
Yea, it got to be rubberised, Spideys suit
that's, that's why he didn't get electrocuted.

614
01:00:26,499 --> 01:00:28,648
Probably some kind of neoprene.
That's what I'll use, honestly...

615
01:00:28,983 --> 01:00:33,346
Thank you very much for the two of you, as you you can tell
so many questions remain unanswered..

616
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:31,543
Online polls show a sudden uptake in public
sentiment in favour of the web-crawler.

617
01:02:31,612 --> 01:02:35,411
Tonight it would seem New York city owes him a debt of gratitude.

618
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,331
Next generation military body armor.

619
01:03:09,455 --> 01:03:13,420
Features include enhanced
mobility, battlefield injury repair.

620
01:03:13,488 --> 01:03:15,879
Direct nervous system interface.

621
01:03:24,712 --> 01:03:28,451
So the common household spider,
umm..unlike human cells,

622
01:03:28,959 --> 01:03:31,801
they contain the power to self-heal

623
01:03:32,169 --> 01:03:34,914
from severe infection, tissue damage.

624
01:03:34,939 --> 01:03:39,431
and so we used radioactive isotope
with compatible human DNA...

625
01:03:41,237 --> 01:03:45,463
Welcome...to Dr. Jallings science
investigator.

626
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:48,268
Today we're going to be talking about
electricity.

627
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,182
Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic current.

628
01:03:51,607 --> 01:03:54,268
Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges.

629
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:57,449
The more powerful the battery, the
bigger the charge it can withstand.

630
01:03:58,065 --> 01:04:02,179
But if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge,

631
01:04:02,236 --> 01:04:06,742
the battery might explode!
Explode!

632
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:12,211
Conducting experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.

633
01:04:12,278 --> 01:04:15,450
- You're not invincible.
- I think I need a bigger battery!

634
01:04:56,407 --> 01:04:59,675
- Hello?
- Pete, its me.

635
01:05:00,613 --> 01:05:05,041
Hey, Harry, what time is it?

636
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:09,122
Late, early, I don't know.
I've been up all night.

637
01:05:09,585 --> 01:05:12,349
- I need to see you.
- You alright...?

638
01:05:12,478 --> 01:05:14,238
Not really Pete.

639
01:05:14,406 --> 01:05:18,640
I'm dying...but I think you can help
save my life.

640
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:24,686
You're looking at the world's first
Human-Spider hybrids.

641
01:05:24,794 --> 01:05:27,931
The hope is to extract the venom
from their glands

642
01:05:28,056 --> 01:05:33,289
and turn that into a cure, an agent
that heals diseased cells.

643
01:05:33,317 --> 01:05:35,712
And if I can be cured...

644
01:05:35,924 --> 01:05:40,935
Imagine what this could do for other
diseases like Alzheimer's even cancer.

645
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:47,259
They never made it to
human trials.

646
01:05:47,697 --> 01:05:51,344
14 years of research and nothing
to show for it.

647
01:05:54,354 --> 01:05:56,535
Except maybe this.

648
01:06:03,746 --> 01:06:07,715
- Spider-Man.
- What about him?

649
01:06:08,313 --> 01:06:11,331
He was bitten by one of
those things that worked.

650
01:06:11,912 --> 01:06:15,598
I don't know how and I
don't know why...but

651
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:22,171
he can do everything else a spider can,
including self-heal.

652
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:24,463
I need to find him.

653
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,695
I need his blood.

654
01:06:41,554 --> 01:06:46,517
You need Spider-Man's blood?

655
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:54,761
- It will save my life.
- It may not, Harry.

656
01:06:54,995 --> 01:06:57,031
It may not be that simple.

657
01:06:57,130 --> 01:07:00,552
- You saw what happened to Curt Connors, right?
- Connors was weak.

658
01:07:00,577 --> 01:07:02,505
This is me, Peter.

659
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:07,787
I don't think you can just set up a
van and have him donate it.

660
01:07:07,944 --> 01:07:12,456
I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive about people shoving needles...and

661
01:07:12,935 --> 01:07:14,498
Probably sensitive?

662
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:19,461
Okay, well then, maybe you can just sensitively tell me where he is

663
01:07:19,524 --> 01:07:22,879
- and I will just go ask him myself.
- What?

664
01:07:26,051 --> 01:07:30,325
- You took his picture.
- So? You know him.

665
01:07:30,595 --> 01:07:36,021
Harry, I took a picture from a long way,
I use a long lens, I don't know him.

666
01:07:37,623 --> 01:07:40,742
- When we were together, you said at the river
- About...?

667
01:07:42,227 --> 01:07:44,859
about how he gives people hope.

668
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:48,458
Come on.

669
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:53,468
Central Server accessed

670
01:08:07,382 --> 01:08:09,718
Just say yes.

671
01:08:15,856 --> 01:08:18,348
Don't turn your back on me.

672
01:08:19,146 --> 01:08:22,662
I don't want to end up like my father, Peter.

673
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:25,678
Please.

674
01:08:26,901 --> 01:08:29,136
- Peter, please.
- I can't.

675
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,906
I'm going to try and find Spider-Man.

676
01:08:54,101 --> 01:08:57,036
- Hey, what's the security doing here?
- That's so weird.

677
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,116
Hey, Miss Stacy.

678
01:09:26,516 --> 01:09:29,813
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

679
01:09:39,851 --> 01:09:42,656
She's not here.
Check another floor.

680
01:09:43,622 --> 01:09:46,089
- Are you in trouble?
- Yea. Who's that guy?

681
01:09:46,113 --> 01:09:49,241
There was an accident,
I need you to know Oscorp, they're covering it up

682
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,719
and I found out. That guy
from Times Square last night,

683
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:56,240
I met him. He was an
electrical engineer in the building

684
01:09:56,309 --> 01:09:59,271
and he loves Spider-Man by the way, otherwise...

685
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:03,213
I didn't get that last night because I got the feeling
that he wanted to kill me with his electrical devise.

686
01:10:03,229 --> 01:10:05,585
That's exactly kind of how it feels like to love you.

687
01:10:06,106 --> 01:10:09,337
I was searching for him in the computer and all files were erased .

688
01:10:09,503 --> 01:10:12,188
- It's completely erased.
- That's Oscorp.

689
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:17,388
- What about you, why are you here?
- Harry, Osborn? he's dying.

690
01:10:17,931 --> 01:10:19,625
- What do you mean he's dying?
- He's dying.

691
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:24,850
And he thinks the only thing going to save
his life is my blood, Spider-Man's blood.

692
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:27,575
As far as I know, if I gave it to
him, it could kill him.

693
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,447
I'm saying worse.

694
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,071
This is the maintenance closet,
Gwen.

695
01:10:34,658 --> 01:10:37,593
This is the most cliche hiding place
you could have chosen.

696
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:39,513
I'm...sorry.

697
01:10:39,525 --> 01:10:44,053
- This is the stupidest hiding place.
- Take us to the Bahamas hiding place.

698
01:10:44,178 --> 01:10:48,034
I don't want to talk to you about
England I guess is because...I don't...

699
01:10:57,802 --> 01:11:00,906
- You just kissed me.
- I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.

700
01:11:01,448 --> 01:11:03,039
How do you like it?

701
01:11:03,521 --> 01:11:07,297
- It felt a little rush.
- I know, I know.

702
01:11:07,378 --> 01:11:10,860
This is the plan. You get to the elevator,
I'm going to distract them, okay? Okay

703
01:11:43,263 --> 01:11:45,440
I'm sorry...I'm all thumbs today.

704
01:11:50,313 --> 01:11:52,293
- Gwen Stacy.
- Oh my God!

705
01:11:56,890 --> 01:12:00,768
- Er...umm...I'm Harry.
- Yea...

706
01:12:01,615 --> 01:12:05,420
- I'm an old friend of Peter's.
- Yea, I know who you are. Sorry.

707
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:07,333
I was kind of rushing...

708
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:12,326
No, I'm sorry he never introduced us.
I thought you two had broken up.

709
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:18,513
Oh...yea, yes, we had, it's...

710
01:12:18,717 --> 01:12:20,645
Complicated.

711
01:12:21,012 --> 01:12:25,878
- Complicated.
- He's Peter. Everything is always complicated with Peter.

712
01:12:28,016 --> 01:12:32,142
- Yea, yea, it's...you're right.
- But that's why I need you.

713
01:12:33,467 --> 01:12:35,024
Right?

714
01:12:36,903 --> 01:12:40,079
To help him make his choices
clear.

715
01:12:43,235 --> 01:12:47,896
- Nice to meet you, Harry.
- Yea, it' such a pleasure, Gwen.

716

You had been in a terrible accident.

718
01:13:48,629 --> 01:13:53,214
I'm Dr. Kafka.
I'm here to help you.

719
01:13:53,576 --> 01:13:55,379
Of course you are, Doc'.

720
01:13:56,176 --> 01:14:00,326
That's why you prepared a
military grade, Biostimulate electrode.

721
01:14:00,898 --> 01:14:05,651
High intensity capacitors.
The kind they make at Oscorp.

722
01:14:05,844 --> 01:14:08,625
All of this because you're trying to help me.

723
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,272
You are correct.

724
01:14:10,288 --> 01:14:12,300
I'm here to study you,

725
01:14:12,469 --> 01:14:17,206
to understand what you are, why you are

726
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:19,761
and I'll get results.

727
01:14:24,878 --> 01:14:26,973
I always do.

728
01:14:29,028 --> 01:14:33,499
You do realize you locked me in a
prison...an advance cell...

729
01:14:33,765 --> 01:14:37,524
all the electricity...

730
01:14:39,763 --> 01:14:44,291
I can feel it in the walls,
I can feel it in my veins.

731
01:14:45,337 --> 01:14:48,896
No matter what you do, Doc' ,
you can't contain it.

732
01:14:49,571 --> 01:14:53,315
It's a force of nature, like me.

733
01:15:00,249 --> 01:15:02,893
- You want to know how powerful I am?
- Yea.

734
01:15:02,993 --> 01:15:05,464
Oh, so do I!

735
01:15:09,293 --> 01:15:13,152
I'm dying...to know.

736
01:15:13,223 --> 01:15:18,836
Doc' , but you better make damn sure you
kill me this time because if you don't...

737
01:15:19,461 --> 01:15:21,513
I'm gonnna kill the light.

738
01:15:21,531 --> 01:15:26,252
Everyone in this city will know
how it feels to live in my world.

739
01:15:27,143 --> 01:15:32,186
A world without power.
A world without mercy.

740
01:15:32,255 --> 01:15:35,793
A world without Spider-Man.

741
01:15:35,818 --> 01:15:40,097
And everyone will be able to see me
for what I truly am.

742
01:15:40,683 --> 01:15:42,696
And who are you?

Very impressive, Electro.

747

Lockdown began.

748
01:16:18,867 --> 01:16:20,570
Aunt May?

749
01:16:25,008 --> 01:16:28,723
- What are you doing?
- When did you do this?

750
01:16:37,794 --> 01:16:40,435
There's something you're not
telling me, Aunt May.

751
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:43,907
Every time I mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

752
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:47,434
I know you're not telling me something. You lie to me.

753
01:16:47,459 --> 01:16:51,001
- I know you love me... I don't.
- I know you love me but you do.

754
01:16:52,006 --> 01:16:56,124
Aunt May, Aunt May, you've to tell me,
Aunt May, it's my father.

755
01:16:56,285 --> 01:16:57,911
Yes, he was your father...

756
01:16:58,219 --> 01:17:02,772
that didn't seem to stop him
from leaving you here.

757
01:17:04,066 --> 01:17:06,230
I need the truth.

758
01:17:07,921 --> 01:17:10,776
The truth is that your parents left you here, on our door-step.

759
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:15,344
And you're this little boy whose wholeworld was
turned upside down with no explanation.

760
01:17:15,513 --> 01:17:18,828
We did the best, we could.

761
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:20,743
Your Uncle Ben, he and I.

762
01:17:20,918 --> 01:17:24,475
Who else was going to care for you and
protect you and worries about you?

763
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,910
Your father? No.

764
01:17:27,378 --> 01:17:31,712
I was the one who wiped your nose
and made you brush your teeth

765
01:17:31,737 --> 01:17:34,463
and do your homework and washed
your dirty underwear. Me!

766
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:39,638
Your stupid, nonscientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet...

767
01:17:39,663 --> 01:17:44,625
who has to take nursing classes, with 22 year old
kids, so I can pay for you to go to college

768
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:48,256
and I don't know how to do
this without Ben. I don't know how

769
01:17:49,053 --> 01:17:52,280
and you're dreaming about your perfect father

770
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:55,174
who was never here? No!

771
01:17:56,346 --> 01:17:59,469
No, I wont tell you.
You're my boy.

772
01:17:59,794 --> 01:18:04,731
As far as I'm concerned, you're my boy.
And I won't hurt you.

773
01:18:13,168 --> 01:18:16,839
I'm your boy.
You're my everything.

774
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:24,259
You're enough. You're more than enough.
That's not what this is about. Don't get that twisted.

775
01:18:25,452 --> 01:18:28,620
- I love you so much.
- I know.

776
01:18:33,124 --> 01:18:37,584
It's okay. It's okay.

777
01:18:39,521 --> 01:18:41,099
Aunt May...

778
01:18:44,006 --> 01:18:46,187
I need to know.

779
01:18:50,845 --> 01:18:52,419
Alright.

780
01:18:55,674 --> 01:18:57,896
I'll tell you everything I know.

781
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:03,552
- But It will hurt you.
- Okay.

782
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:09,901
A few days after the funeral...

783
01:19:10,031 --> 01:19:13,807
Two government men came to see us.

784
01:19:15,756 --> 01:19:18,690
They said, the genetic research

785
01:19:18,715 --> 01:19:22,379
that your father was doing with
Norman Osborn was very valuable

786
01:19:22,705 --> 01:19:27,483
and that people would pay a lot for it
and thats why he ran off with it.

787
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:31,445
They said he was a traitor.
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

788
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:36,494
They told us he betrayed his best
friend, all of us, for the money.

789
01:19:41,204 --> 01:19:43,449
I don't...I don't get it.
No...this doesn't make sense.

790
01:19:43,474 --> 01:19:47,205
Yes, I know.
I didn't believe it either. I didn't believe it.

791
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,648
- This doesn't make any sense..
- Peter... I don't know.

792
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:57,032
For so long, I would play it over and over in
my head what had I missed, what had I missed.

793
01:19:57,057 --> 01:20:03,019
He was just a normal unassuming guy. He wore
the same ratty lab coat for 20 years...

794
01:20:03,044 --> 01:20:06,014
He took the D train to work,
at 7 every morning...

795
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:08,361
came home at 6 every night.

796
01:20:09,331 --> 01:20:10,841
I don't know.

797
01:20:11,037 --> 01:20:14,605
Maybe everyone has a part of
himself they hide...

798
01:20:15,513 --> 01:20:17,977
even from the people they love.

799
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:35,332
Mr. Osborn.

800
01:20:40,122 --> 01:20:44,515
Look up.
I think you're looking for me.

801
01:20:46,831 --> 01:20:49,052
I cannot believe my eyes.

802
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:51,290
Spider-Man.

803
01:20:58,609 --> 01:21:01,366
Just the man I wanted to see.

804
01:21:03,471 --> 01:21:09,689
- You...err...talked to Peter?
- Yeap.

805
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:19,027
I want to help you, Mr. Osborn.
I really, really do.

806
01:21:20,114 --> 01:21:23,849
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

807
01:21:23,974 --> 01:21:27,874
- Excuse me?
- It's too dangerous.

808
01:21:28,587 --> 01:21:32,249
If our blood isn't compatible,
you could die.

809
01:21:32,652 --> 01:21:34,455
I'm already dying.

810
01:21:35,295 --> 01:21:40,040
- Your blood can't make me die more.
- But it could do something worse.

811
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:43,219
Okay.

812
01:21:45,182 --> 01:21:46,800
Alright, how much?

813
01:21:47,325 --> 01:21:49,112
- How much what?
- How much do you want?

814
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:53,829
Maybe a boat, a plane or
money? How much do you want?

815
01:21:54,455 --> 01:21:57,767
- I don't want your money.
- Come on! Everybody wants my money!

816
01:21:58,765 --> 01:22:00,540
I don't.

817
01:22:03,864 --> 01:22:06,254
I thought...I thought you're suppose to save people.

818
01:22:06,927 --> 01:22:10,618
I thought that's what you do,
is you save peoples' lives.

819
01:22:11,345 --> 01:22:13,692
You just gonna let me die.

820
01:22:13,717 --> 01:22:16,985
I'm trying to protect you, right now.

821
01:22:17,665 --> 01:22:20,181
You're trying to protect yourself.

822
01:22:20,224 --> 01:22:24,920
Look...we just need a bit more time

823
01:22:25,145 --> 01:22:27,762
I do not have time! Get out!

824
01:22:34,654 --> 01:22:36,289
I'm sorry.

825
01:22:44,632 --> 01:22:47,038
You're a fraud, Spider-Man!

826
01:23:03,451 --> 01:23:06,470
- Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
- Hi, I'm running late right now.

827
01:23:07,085 --> 01:23:09,769
No, no...it's just  going to take a second.

828
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,477
Give me a minute, just give me one minute,
I'm just going to say one thing then I'm gone.

829
01:23:13,502 --> 01:23:14,552
Everything is a mess!

830
01:23:14,577 --> 01:23:17,261
My dad, my mum,
everything my father do...lies!

831
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:20,759
Lies, lies, lies.
Nothing make any sense anymore.

832
01:23:20,911 --> 01:23:24,434
So here we are. I got to figure what I'm going to
do with Harry. Of course I want to save him, you know.

833
01:23:24,951 --> 01:23:26,767
How hard is it to save him...cos' he's my best pal.

834
01:23:27,155 --> 01:23:31,901
What if my blood works? But what if it
doesn't? I don't know. I got no idea.

835
01:23:34,506 --> 01:23:36,305
I got nothing.

836
01:23:36,365 --> 01:23:39,343
The only thing I keep coming back to...
Gwen is...

837
01:23:39,906 --> 01:23:43,515
Miss Stacy, shall I take you
upstairs?

838
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:45,912
Yes, I'm so sorry.

839
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:50,591
I'm so sorry..I'm already late...
Can I have just one more minute?

840
01:23:51,891 --> 01:23:53,750
Thank you, I'm sorry.

841
01:23:54,888 --> 01:24:00,897
- Where are we?
- I've to be...er...I'm at...my last interview for Oxford, right now.

842
01:24:02,623 --> 01:24:05,099
- Oxford? I didn't know.
- Yea.

843
01:24:07,568 --> 01:24:11,006
OK, well, I'm sorry to bother you,
er...umm...my fair lady...

844
01:24:11,893 --> 01:24:15,399
but madame, madame but er...who am I?
I mean, who am I? I am John Hopkins.

845
01:24:15,424 --> 01:24:20,346
I'm one of the young professors at Harvard
and I'm trying to get her to be in my...

846
01:24:21,218 --> 01:24:23,949
to be part of my team, for a while now

847
01:24:24,018 --> 01:24:27,455
and she is the best person I know
and a scientific genius

848
01:24:28,135 --> 01:24:32,782
- and...anyway, "God save the Queen" I'm sorry that I made things...
- Excuse me, Peter!

849
01:24:33,155 --> 01:24:37,656
Peter, what do you want to say to me?
What's the one thing?

850
01:24:41,921 --> 01:24:43,763
I have to go to England for a year.

851
01:24:45,777 --> 01:24:47,403
It's important to me.

852
01:24:51,564 --> 01:24:55,251
I know, I know we're on different path right now.

853
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:57,494
You know...I don't know.

854
01:24:57,519 --> 01:25:04,663
We were just going different ways.
I gotta go. I gotta go.

855
01:25:07,266 --> 01:25:07,766
Gwen.

856
01:25:10,581 --> 01:25:12,409
Good luck.

857
01:26:32,876 --> 01:26:37,771
"Roosevelt's secret  station:
Track 61, a secret subterranean extension of New York's

858
01:26:38,137 --> 01:26:40,906
"D" line train under Pershing Square

859
01:26:40,957 --> 01:26:44,688
was originally built to transport President Franklin Roosevelt
away from the public eye...

860
01:26:44,713 --> 01:26:48,190
to keep his polio hidden
from the American people."

861
01:26:57,667 --> 01:26:58,279
Mr. Osborn.

862
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,779
You alright? Is there anything I can
get you or...?

863
01:27:04,904 --> 01:27:08,265
No, not unless you can bring
those spiders back to life.

864
01:27:08,676 --> 01:27:11,903
- Spiders?
- The ones that they destroyed.

865
01:27:13,079 --> 01:27:16,266
"To restore investors' confidence."

866
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:21,552
Go home, Felicia.
Take the day off.

867
01:27:23,208 --> 01:27:23,708
Harry!

868
01:27:26,623 --> 01:27:30,439
I think there may be another way,
to get what you're looking for...

869
01:27:32,741 --> 01:27:37,059
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security's head.

870
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:43,321
Before they destroyed the spiders,
they had the venom extracted.

871
01:27:47,803 --> 01:27:49,336
What are you saying?

872
01:27:49,404 --> 01:27:55,300
That way they could comply with the lawsuits but
still keep the data in case whenever it became useful.

873
01:27:56,725 --> 01:27:59,908
- Where is it?
- Somewhere in the building.

874
01:28:00,778 --> 01:28:04,384
Somewhere off the books
called "Special Projects".

875

<i>Special Projects.

<i>Accessing Ravenscroft archive.</i>

<i>...and then I'm going to kill the light,</i>

879
01:28:38,293 --> 01:28:42,911
so everyone in this city will discover
how it feels to live in my world.

880
01:28:42,936 --> 01:28:47,825
<i>A world without power.
A world without Spider-Man.</i>

01:28:52,805 --> 01:28:55,529
He's busy. You can't go in there. He's busy.

883
01:28:55,562 --> 01:28:59,010
- What did you do?
- A more relevant question is what did you do?

884
01:28:59,686 --> 01:29:03,089
An employee is killed and your
first action as CEO, you covered it up!

885
01:29:03,157 --> 01:29:07,987
No, you covered it up and then you
buried him in the bug house using my name.

886
01:29:08,156 --> 01:29:11,769
Ravenscroft is a time warning institution
devoted to mental improvement.

887
01:29:12,321 --> 01:29:17,256
- You're experimenting on people in there.
- Progress has its stepping stones.

888
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:20,887
Now, in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you have been...

889
01:29:20,895 --> 01:29:24,106
how do I put this gently...
fired.

890
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:26,026
You're not going to bury me too.

891
01:29:26,254 --> 01:29:29,323
Looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

892
01:29:30,283 --> 01:29:35,125
It's only a matter of time.
You're going to die a horrible death,

893
01:29:35,282 --> 01:29:37,362
like your father.

894
01:29:37,921 --> 01:29:42,380
The difference is,
no one is going to miss you.

895
01:29:43,925 --> 01:29:46,385
- Get him out.
- Wait, wait!

896
01:29:54,133 --> 01:29:56,254
I know my way out.

897
01:32:40,797 --> 01:32:43,196
My name is Richard Parker.

898
01:32:43,481 --> 01:32:47,913
Whatever lies will be told about me,
I would like the world to know the truth.

899
01:32:48,049 --> 01:32:51,362
<i>Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research</i>

900
01:32:51,531 --> 01:32:56,478
when Norman Osborn made a deal with
a foreign military organization

901
01:32:56,602 --> 01:32:59,202
to continue funding my research.

902
01:32:59,211 --> 01:33:01,952
And I discovered what they were going to use it for.

903
01:33:01,977 --> 01:33:05,884
Weapons, biological weapons of course. So I refused.

904
01:33:05,953 --> 01:33:09,442
And now to eliminate me from the picture,

905
01:33:09,608 --> 01:33:13,592
Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me

906
01:33:13,758 --> 01:33:17,363
in order to take control of my work.

907
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:22,355
Can I help you?

908
01:33:22,524 --> 01:33:26,548
Yea, you can open the gate.
I'm Harry Osborn.

909
01:33:26,673 --> 01:33:30,574
There's a patient that I specially would like to see.

910
01:33:30,782 --> 01:33:33,717
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn, Oscorp.

911
01:33:33,874 --> 01:33:36,805
Sorry sir, without a yellow badge,
you can't even pass this point.

912
01:33:40,257 --> 01:33:45,539
Well, it doesn't matter because there is
something else that Norman doesn't know.

913
01:33:47,008 --> 01:33:51,869
The human DNA that I implanted in
the spiders

914
01:33:53,423 --> 01:33:55,090
was my own.

915
01:33:57,448 --> 01:34:01,683
Which means that without me,
without my bloodline,

916
01:34:01,847 --> 01:34:06,081
Oscorp can never replicate or
continue my experiments.

917
01:34:06,363 --> 01:34:08,879
Keep Electro incubated,

918
01:34:09,347 --> 01:34:13,542
400 milligrams of sodium
and phenobarbital,

919
01:34:15,004 --> 01:34:19,053
I've...I've destroyed as much as possible from the archives

920
01:34:19,063 --> 01:34:22,094
but I didn't have time
to kill all the spiders.

921
01:34:22,598 --> 01:34:25,323
So as a scientist, my choice is very clear now.

922
01:34:25,532 --> 01:34:29,304
I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can

923
01:34:29,353 --> 01:34:31,365
but as a father

924
01:34:31,390 --> 01:34:34,798
it means, I may not see my boy
again.

925
01:34:36,414 --> 01:34:41,793
and nothing is as
important to me as my son, Peter.

926
01:34:42,008 --> 01:34:43,727
Nothing in this world.

927
01:34:44,243 --> 01:34:48,557
But I have a responsibility to protect
the world from what I've created

928
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:51,649
and protect him from what
I know Osborn is capable of.

929
01:34:52,635 --> 01:34:55,066
People will say I'm a monster

930
01:34:56,048 --> 01:34:58,020
for what I've done.

931
01:34:59,324 --> 01:35:01,207
Maybe they're right.

932
01:35:03,379 --> 01:35:06,986
I always thought that I'd have more time.

933
01:35:07,162 --> 01:35:10,555
- Dad...Dad!...
- I'm sorry.

934
01:35:28,764 --> 01:35:31,209
Sedation...off...

935
01:35:37,802 --> 01:35:42,327
I'm gonna get you out.
Alright but we don't have much time.

936
01:35:42,627 --> 01:35:47,071
- Who are you?
- I'm Harry Osborn. I want to make you a deal.

937
01:35:49,330 --> 01:35:52,602
- I should kill you.
- Come on.

938
01:35:53,065 --> 01:35:57,299
Think big, Max.
I'm not the one you want.

939
01:35:57,464 --> 01:36:01,961
You want Spider-Man
and I can give him to you.

940
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:07,652
But...I need something first.

941
01:36:09,117 --> 01:36:11,378
I need you to get me to Oscorp.

942
01:36:11,415 --> 01:36:15,052
Get you in? You own it.

943
01:36:16,063 --> 01:36:18,579
Not anymore.
Oscorp betrayed us both.

944
01:36:18,704 --> 01:36:22,928
So I can't get in there without you and
you can't get out of here without me.

945
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:26,301
- What've you done?
- Someone pulled an alarm in the ISO unit...

946
01:36:26,326 --> 01:36:29,127
Get a containment team in there now!

947
01:36:30,016 --> 01:36:31,951
You can't possibly know what I want.

948
01:36:31,983 --> 01:36:35,758
You submitted the design for the grid
and they stole it and now you want it back.

949
01:36:35,759 --> 01:36:37,473
You just wanna take back what's yours!

950
01:36:37,911 --> 01:36:42,935
- How?
- All the power is in the city, Max, and its right at your fingertips.

951
01:36:43,377 --> 01:36:45,377
Once you shut down the grid...

952
01:36:45,402 --> 01:36:49,342
Spider-Man will come to you and I want you to make him bleed!

953
01:36:51,304 --> 01:36:53,015
Break it! Break it!

954
01:36:55,402 --> 01:36:57,745
Max, we don't have much time.

955
01:36:57,780 --> 01:36:58,596
Go... go... go.

956
01:36:59,655 --> 01:37:03,294
- Give me one reason why I should trust you?
- Because I need you!

957
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:09,081
- You need me?
- Yes, I need you.

958
01:37:09,106 --> 01:37:13,215
You are my only chance that
I have at surviving.

959
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:16,743
- You need me?
- Yes, I need you.

960
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:19,923
I need you...please, please!

961
01:37:21,532 --> 01:37:24,844
- I know what its like to be thrown away..
- Please...Max!

962
01:37:24,869 --> 01:37:27,631
I need you! I need you!

963
01:38:23,207 --> 01:38:24,885
You want to be my friend?

964
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:27,588
I thought we were already friends?

965
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:31,359
I had a friend once.

966
01:38:31,737 --> 01:38:33,890
It didn't work out.

967
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:36,023
Yea, me too.

968
01:38:37,190 --> 01:38:40,131
Then let's go catch a spider.

969
01:38:42,765 --> 01:38:45,240
You have one new voice message.

970
01:38:47,587 --> 01:38:50,473
Hi, Peter, it's me.

971
01:38:51,486 --> 01:38:55,296
I...I got into Oxford. Woo-hoo.

972
01:38:56,967 --> 01:38:58,702
It's very exciting.

973
01:38:58,724 --> 01:39:04,440
I came by your house a little bit
ago and I..you weren't there and so

974
01:39:04,916 --> 01:39:07,311
I'm on my way to the airport
right now

975
01:39:07,336 --> 01:39:10,345
because there's this early summer
class I found out about

976
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:13,517
and I thought that it would
somehow

977
01:39:13,852 --> 01:39:17,877
be easier, I guess, this way.

978
01:39:18,504 --> 01:39:24,737
I think that maybe it's time to
let this go...

979
01:39:24,804 --> 01:39:30,717
and that's not because I don't love you,
it's actually because I do.

980
01:39:31,546 --> 01:39:33,533
So, umm...goodbye.

981
01:39:47,161 --> 01:39:50,053
- We have to move now!
- Why? What's happening?

982
01:40:02,943 --> 01:40:04,842
Remember me?

983
01:40:08,985 --> 01:40:12,507
Oh my oh my, how the tables have
turned.

984
01:40:13,274 --> 01:40:17,825
I know it's hard to admit but how
spectacular

985
01:40:17,854 --> 01:40:21,994
- remove this desk, am I right?
- Right, that's right.

986
01:40:25,888 --> 01:40:28,245
OK, so , Fairy Godmother,

987
01:40:28,326 --> 01:40:31,341
it's time to create me a wish.

988
01:40:31,366 --> 01:40:36,713
- I want in...to special...
- How dare you come back in here?

989
01:40:36,765 --> 01:40:41,921
You recalcitrant, unworthy, defective, urchin, freak!

990
01:40:44,898 --> 01:40:49,383
Oh...God I'm sorry, that's just not the answer we were looking for.

991
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:06,477
"Clear."

992
01:41:06,711 --> 01:41:09,687
Welome back to the bonus round.

993
01:41:12,162 --> 01:41:14,733
Let's take a walk, shall we?

994
01:41:18,324 --> 01:41:22,137
The grid is all yours.

995
01:41:53,514 --> 01:41:56,436
Spider-Man, give it to me.

996
01:42:01,812 --> 01:42:05,202
- What is all these stuff?
- The future.

997
01:42:18,982 --> 01:42:21,092
Load one up.

998
01:42:24,128 --> 01:42:28,643
It won't work.
We're in heavy diagnostic test.

999
01:42:28,668 --> 01:42:32,824
- Apart from human trials...
- I thought that should be already on human trials...

1000
01:42:32,863 --> 01:42:35,988
you're just too stupid to know it.

1001
01:42:37,527 --> 01:42:40,612
Do it. Now.

1002
01:42:59,977 --> 01:43:02,469
You had it all this time!

1003
01:44:18,447 --> 01:44:20,018
Critical Injury Detected

1004
01:44:20,043 --> 01:44:21,687
Healing Protocol Activated

1005
01:44:31,362 --> 01:44:33,133
It's Spider-Man!

1006
01:44:38,783 --> 01:44:42,221
- Stop the cab.
- Wait, I aint even moving!

1007
01:45:14,937 --> 01:45:17,324
- Did you get my message?
- What's the message?

1008
01:45:17,349 --> 01:45:19,698
- The message over there.
- Oh that! It was you?

1009
01:45:19,705 --> 01:45:21,892
- Don't do that.
- I couldn't make it up.

1010
01:45:21,961 --> 01:45:24,143
I tell you what it says, it says 'I love you'

1011
01:45:26,117 --> 01:45:27,795
because I love you.

1012
01:45:28,842 --> 01:45:31,486
No offense but you're wrong.

1013
01:45:31,611 --> 01:45:35,591
What would that be? You're wrong about us being
on different path.  We're not on different path, you're my path!

1014
01:45:36,898 --> 01:45:39,179
I know I'm not always going to be my best

1015
01:45:40,248 --> 01:45:43,771
and I know there's so many reasons
why we shouldn't be together, I know that.

1016
01:45:43,844 --> 01:45:45,783
Well, I'm tired of them all.

1017
01:45:48,228 --> 01:45:50,495
I'm tired of every single one of it.

1018
01:45:50,983 --> 01:45:53,249
If I'm gonna to make a choice,

1019
01:45:54,828 --> 01:45:56,494
then I choose you.

1020
01:45:58,818 --> 01:46:00,505
So...

1021
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:03,344
here's my thought.

1022
01:46:03,991 --> 01:46:05,533
England.

1023
01:46:06,628 --> 01:46:08,330
Both of us.

1024
01:46:09,846 --> 01:46:13,914
I'm following you now.
I'm just going to follow you everywhere.

1025
01:46:14,316 --> 01:46:16,603
I'm just going to follow you
the rest of my life.

1026
01:46:17,546 --> 01:46:20,858
I mean...they got crime there...in England.

1027
01:46:21,081 --> 01:46:23,637
They got tons of crime, it seems.

1028
01:46:23,687 --> 01:46:27,764
- Tons...
- Yea, they got...Jack the Ripper.

1029
01:46:29,090 --> 01:46:33,005
They haven't caught Jack the Ripper yet, can you believe that?

1030
01:46:51,071 --> 01:46:53,383
What the hell is that?

1031
01:47:03,153 --> 01:47:05,223
Is that Max?

1032
01:47:05,248 --> 01:47:08,150
He must have cut the power to the whole city.

1033
01:47:20,324 --> 01:47:22,755
- Totally black!
- Hey, I need tech-ops up here right now!

1034
01:47:22,959 --> 01:47:26,021
Phones are down. Somebody
go down and grab tech-ops...

1035
01:47:26,046 --> 01:47:27,920
Hey... write down what you remember,
people.

1036
01:47:27,945 --> 01:47:30,647
There's gotta be some kind
of a "blackout plan", right?

1037
01:47:31,223 --> 01:47:34,558
- Some kind of backup?
- There's an emergency resides at the power plant.

1038
01:47:34,781 --> 01:47:37,186
If he got the transmission lines,

1039
01:47:37,211 --> 01:47:39,321
- they never gonna get this back up.
- How am I going to stop him?

1040
01:47:39,346 --> 01:47:41,622
Every time I get close to him,
he fries my web-shooter.

1041
01:47:41,647 --> 01:47:44,459
- Okay, have you tried him
- Yes, I tried everything, rubber, plastic...

1042
01:47:44,484 --> 01:47:48,256
- Did you try magnetizing him?
- I didn't...try magnetizing him.

1043
01:47:48,679 --> 01:47:50,860
Okay, well, remember eighth grade
Science class?

1044
01:47:51,285 --> 01:47:54,099
If you magnetize a nail with a battery...

1045
01:47:54,124 --> 01:47:56,325
- You cause an electric charge.
- Yes...

1046
01:47:58,261 --> 01:48:02,085
New York approach...this is Pan National 273 on approach...

1047
01:48:02,110 --> 01:48:04,088
How do you hear?

1048
01:48:04,187 --> 01:48:07,709
- Approach, do you copy?
- Radio is working, it's not us.

1049
01:48:14,675 --> 01:48:19,456
Do not panic, everyone, please return to vehicle!

1050
01:48:19,581 --> 01:48:23,227
Go back to your car, remain calm!

1051
01:48:24,652 --> 01:48:27,377
Do not panic!
Everyone return to your vehicle! Go to your home!

1052
01:48:28,212 --> 01:48:30,309
- Officer!
- Spider-Man!

1053
01:48:30,610 --> 01:48:35,101
- My father was Captain George Stacy at your precinct,
- Yea, I know who he was. What can we do for you?

1054
01:48:35,102 --> 01:48:38,331
- Jumper cables! Jumper cables?
- Yes and...copper wire.

1055
01:48:38,659 --> 01:48:42,894
- Am I talking louder than I usually talk right now?
- Yes.

1056
01:48:43,283 --> 01:48:45,931
- You're still doing fine.
- Alright, do it!

1057
01:48:49,224 --> 01:48:52,114
Did you get it?
Try...try...Hurry...hurry...

1058
01:48:52,324 --> 01:48:56,348
- Okay, it works , good.
- And that, is why you were number two in Midtown. Rubbing in Okay.

1059
01:48:58,699 --> 01:49:00,458
- I gotta go.
- I'm coming with you.

1060
01:49:00,627 --> 01:49:03,252
- Gwen, you're not coming with me.
- Yes I am. Come on...it's too dangerous.

1061
01:49:03,277 --> 01:49:06,209
I'm coming with you I see the specs
and I know how to reset the entire system.

1062
01:49:06,274 --> 01:49:09,377
Gwen I'm coming with you.
You know that you need me.

1063
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:12,308
Then come with me.
Shut that thing.

1064
01:49:12,385 --> 01:49:14,590
Sorry, I love you.
Don't hate me.

1065
01:49:17,514 --> 01:49:21,076
We gotta work with this. They're still not back with the generator.
Get me engineering!

1066
01:49:21,459 --> 01:49:25,753
- I need a respirator right now!
- I'll get the battery operated. I get hang on!

1067
01:49:50,073 --> 01:49:52,339
Can you see me now, Spider-Man?

1068
01:49:52,673 --> 01:49:56,671
It's time to meet our destiny.

1069
01:50:11,625 --> 01:50:16,991
Tower, we're experiencing some kind of electrical disturbance.
Instruments are going haywire, radar is down.

1070
01:50:17,323 --> 01:50:20,070
We're flying blind out here,
do you copy?

1071
01:50:24,197 --> 01:50:26,633
Tower, repeat, we're "standby" only,
what is happening?

1072
01:50:27,589 --> 01:50:30,195
Sir, there're two inbound flights on intersecting path!

1073
01:50:30,196 --> 01:50:32,551
Time to impact?
4 and a half minutes.

1074
01:50:32,552 --> 01:50:34,186
Clock it... Clock it right now.

1075
01:50:47,550 --> 01:50:51,788
You're too late, Spider-Man.
I designed this power grid.

1076
01:50:51,913 --> 01:50:55,559
Now I'm gonna take back
what is rightfully mine.

1077
01:50:55,894 --> 01:50:58,116
I want control of everything.

1078
01:50:58,329 --> 01:51:03,871
- And I will be like a God to them.
- A God named "Sparkles?"

1079
01:51:13,925 --> 01:51:17,618
Not this time. Is that all you got?
Come on!

1080
01:51:37,128 --> 01:51:38,703
Come on!

1081
01:51:42,408 --> 01:51:44,386
You ready to give up?

1082
01:51:54,341 --> 01:51:56,857
Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy.

1083
01:52:07,242 --> 01:52:11,911
Shake it off. This is your bones,
muscles and your organs.

1084
01:52:15,373 --> 01:52:15,873
Oh boy!

1085
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:26,281
I hate this song!

1086
01:52:45,932 --> 01:52:49,432
Spider-Man, bet you never
saw this coming...

1087
01:52:55,868 --> 01:52:57,525
Really?

1088
01:52:57,544 --> 01:53:00,538
You wired me to a car,
what are you, a little caveman?

1089
01:53:00,867 --> 01:53:04,138
You tie me up to go off to war?
I know how to help you!

1090
01:53:04,635 --> 01:53:08,366
- What're you doing here?
- I know the grid best. I can reset the system.

1091
01:53:08,699 --> 01:53:12,680
You can't be here right now. I'm not messing
around. You can't be here right now. this is insane!

1092
01:53:12,802 --> 01:53:15,862
Guess what
Nobody makes my decisions for me, alright? Nobody!

1093
01:53:15,913 --> 01:53:17,879
This is my choice, okay?

1094
01:53:18,635 --> 01:53:21,026
- My choice...
- Go! Mine!

1095
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:23,397
Now how do we stop him?

1096
01:53:23,667 --> 01:53:27,188
Okay, so he uses electric. He's like a battery.
So what happens when you overcharge a battery?

1097
01:53:27,397 --> 01:53:30,920
- It explodes. Right!
- So we use his power against him, perfect!

1098
01:53:30,945 --> 01:53:34,735
Okay, I think I can reconnect the power line
but what I need you to do, I need you to reset the system.

1099
01:53:34,736 --> 01:53:40,070
- Okay when I say you turn that power on, you turn it on.
- No matter what. Peter... No matter what.

1100
01:53:44,592 --> 01:53:46,294
Go! Go!

1101
01:54:37,849 --> 01:54:39,902
60 seconds to impact.

1102
01:55:14,707 --> 01:55:17,457
Now, Gwen, do it now...!

1103
01:55:37,318 --> 01:55:39,081
<i>Overload</i>

1104
01:55:43,033 --> 01:55:44,711
Unit 687.

1105
01:55:54,681 --> 01:55:58,211
This is La Guardia tower. Turn
immediately to heading 280.

1106
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:02,894
Incoming traffic, I repeat 280.

1107
01:56:20,182 --> 01:56:22,448
Okay people, back to work, let's
land these planes.

1108
01:56:22,613 --> 01:56:24,247
I'll be back.

1109
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:29,596
Thank God, alright! Alright,
we're back, everyone, lets go.

1110
01:57:05,090 --> 01:57:07,281
Are you still able to make it to your fight?

1111
01:57:15,805 --> 01:57:17,907
Gwen, stay there.

1112
01:57:43,521 --> 01:57:44,021
Peter.

1113
01:57:45,515 --> 01:57:48,702
When you said Spider-Man said no,

1114
01:57:49,135 --> 01:57:53,205
you meant "you" said "no"

1115
01:57:53,438 --> 01:57:56,129
Harry, what did you do?

1116
01:57:56,217 --> 01:57:58,273
What you made me do.

1117
01:57:58,413 --> 01:58:02,947
You were my friend and you betrayed me!

1118
01:58:03,127 --> 01:58:06,689
No, I was trying to protect you.

1119
01:58:07,315 --> 01:58:10,961
- Look at me!
- Hey. it's gonna be okay. This is gonna be alright.

1120
01:58:11,024 --> 01:58:14,876
You give people no hope.
You take it away.

1121
01:58:15,037 --> 01:58:18,724
- No, Harry.
- I'm going to take away yours!

1122
01:58:18,817 --> 01:58:20,476
No, Gwen...run...

1123
01:58:22,611 --> 01:58:24,394
Harry, Harry put her down!

1124
01:58:40,566 --> 01:58:42,153
Harry, stop this right now.

1125
01:58:42,178 --> 01:58:45,407
This isn't you, Harry, this is
not you. Harry, put her down!

1126
01:58:46,342 --> 01:58:48,354
- Harry!
- Harry's dead!

1127
01:58:48,379 --> 01:58:51,438
Harry, this is between you and me.
You wanna fight?

1128
01:58:51,544 --> 01:58:53,640
Fight me, let her go!

1129
01:59:05,419 --> 01:59:07,488
You okay?

1130
01:59:11,957 --> 01:59:14,700
I got you, I'm going to put you down right now.

1131
02:02:03,456 --> 02:02:04,966
Breathe!

1132
02:02:17,356 --> 02:02:19,368
You okay?

1133
02:02:29,182 --> 02:02:33,814
Stay with me, stay with me,
stay with me, you stay with me.

1134
02:02:43,003 --> 02:02:43,503
Gwen!

1135
02:02:46,598 --> 02:02:49,198
Gwen...no, please!

1136
02:02:51,617 --> 02:02:53,523
Please!

1137
02:03:00,012 --> 02:03:02,238
I can't do...

1138
02:05:05,007 --> 02:05:07,136
Leave us.

1139
02:05:10,822 --> 02:05:12,794
You made progress?

1140
02:05:12,819 --> 02:05:16,171
I laid down and find several worthy candidates.

1141
02:05:16,285 --> 02:05:18,422
Now that Spider-Man's gone...

1142
02:05:18,591 --> 02:05:21,775
the city will never be the same.

1143
02:05:22,229 --> 02:05:24,745
Oh...I'm counting on that.

1144
02:05:24,909 --> 02:05:27,848
Speaking of progress,
you're looking better.

1145
02:05:28,810 --> 02:05:30,657
It comes and goes.

1146
02:05:32,332 --> 02:05:33,926
Tell me more.

1147
02:05:34,269 --> 02:05:38,128
- How many men did you have in mind?
- I want to keep it small.

1148
02:05:38,293 --> 02:05:41,735
Everything you need is already at Oscorp.

1149
02:05:43,569 --> 02:05:47,594
<i>Access granted.
Welcome, Mr. Fiers.</i>

1150
02:05:47,632 --> 02:05:51,704
- Who is our first volunteer?
- Aleksei Sytsevich.

1151
02:05:51,728 --> 02:05:53,990
Apparently serving a
life sentence.

1152
02:05:54,162 --> 02:05:57,892
He is most eager to join us.

1153
02:05:58,535 --> 02:06:00,137
<i>Good.</i>

1154
02:06:00,578 --> 02:06:02,590
<i>Start with him.</i>

1155
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:08,226
<i>Russian ganster Aleksei Sytsevich was broken out of a
classified penetentiary known simply as 'The Vault'</i>

1156
02:06:08,469 --> 02:06:10,064
by an unknown team of men.

1157
02:06:10,395 --> 02:06:13,164
It's yet another example of
increased criminal activity

1158
02:06:13,189 --> 02:06:16,500
since the disappearance of Spider-Man
5 months ago.

1159
02:06:16,525 --> 02:06:19,845
The webslingers absence has
left a hole in the heart of the city.

1160
02:06:19,970 --> 02:06:24,329
Believe it or not even the New York city Police
Department has joined the chorus of New Yorkers

1161
02:06:24,554 --> 02:06:27,005
in hoping for the return of the webslinger.

1162
02:06:27,030 --> 02:06:29,969
The entire world seems to be asking
the same question:

1163
02:06:30,073 --> 02:06:32,171
Where is Spider-Man?

1164
02:06:33,131 --> 02:06:35,606
Too bad without that spider-guy.

1165
02:06:37,515 --> 02:06:40,816
Too bad he disappeared, seems like
everybody really needs him.

1166
02:06:42,461 --> 02:06:44,124
Where you going?

1167
02:06:44,937 --> 02:06:47,618
- I'm not sure.
- Peter...

1168
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:50,053
Where are you going?

1169
02:06:59,251 --> 02:07:00,826
I don't know.

1170
02:07:02,649 --> 02:07:04,367
You know what? It's so funny...

1171
02:07:05,252 --> 02:07:08,101
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organised and

1172
02:07:08,168 --> 02:07:12,990
been putting some of Ben's stuff...in boxes

1173
02:07:13,424 --> 02:07:17,195
It's funny that the heavier the box gets,
the lighter I feel.

1174
02:07:17,807 --> 02:07:20,429
You throwing his stuff away?

1175
02:07:21,712 --> 02:07:24,856
No, no, God no. I couldn't do that.
It's a part of me.

1176
02:07:25,714 --> 02:07:28,648
I'm just...finding...

1177
02:07:29,790 --> 02:07:31,300
a better place for it.

1178
02:07:35,035 --> 02:07:37,519
I'm gonna take one last look...

1179
02:07:37,863 --> 02:07:40,611
and then I'm gonna put it where it belongs.

1180
02:07:58,951 --> 02:08:00,622
Gwen's speech.

1181
02:08:05,294 --> 02:08:09,488
It is easy to feel hopeful
on a beautiful day like today.

1182
02:08:10,404 --> 02:08:13,298
But there will be dark days ahead of us too.

1183
02:08:14,479 --> 02:08:17,337
There will be days when you
feel all alone

1184
02:08:19,551 --> 02:08:22,026
and that's when hope is needed
most.

1185
02:08:23,491 --> 02:08:25,548
No matter how bad it gets

1186
02:08:26,385 --> 02:08:30,450
or how lost you feel, you must promise me

1187
02:08:30,659 --> 02:08:34,016
that you will hold on to hope.

1188
02:08:35,521 --> 02:08:37,292
Keep it alive.

1189
02:08:37,653 --> 02:08:40,642
We have to be greater
than what we suffer.

1190
02:08:40,766 --> 02:08:44,666
My wish for you is to become hope.

1191
02:08:44,925 --> 02:08:46,937
People need that.

1192
02:08:47,543 --> 02:08:52,194
And even if we fail, what better way
is there to live.

1193
02:08:53,331 --> 02:08:55,344
As we look around here today,

1194
02:08:55,509 --> 02:08:58,737
that all of the people who help
make us who we are,

1195
02:08:59,409 --> 02:09:02,324
I know it feels like we're
saying 'goodbye'

1196
02:09:02,844 --> 02:09:08,610
But we'll carry a piece of each other into
everything that we do next

1197
02:09:09,806 --> 02:09:12,824
to remind us of who we are

1198
02:09:14,671 --> 02:09:16,475
and if we were meant to be,

1199
02:09:18,821 --> 02:09:23,265
you had a great 4 years with
you. I'll miss you all very much.

1200
02:09:45,412 --> 02:09:47,330
Let's go! Move it!

1201
02:10:00,380 --> 02:10:04,783
<i>I'm here live on Park Avenue 56th
Street where it's complete chaos.</i>

1202
02:10:05,292 --> 02:10:09,193
<i>A man in some sort of weaponised
armored suit is wreaking havoc on midtown</i>

1203
02:10:13,058 --> 02:10:18,383
I'm Rhino.
I told you I would be back.

1204
02:10:36,532 --> 02:10:40,484
Hold your fire.
Everybody hold your fire.

1205
02:10:47,335 --> 02:10:49,732
Kid, you got to get...

1206
02:10:51,047 --> 02:10:52,847
Look, New York.

1207
02:10:52,943 --> 02:10:55,311
Spider-Man is back.

1208
02:10:56,488 --> 02:10:58,500
That's my baby.

1209
02:11:01,544 --> 02:11:03,681
Brave boy, huh.

1210
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:06,114
Does Aleksei scares you, little
boy?

1211
02:11:23,642 --> 02:11:25,421
Hey, Spider-Man.

1212
02:11:35,412 --> 02:11:39,607
- I knew you'd come back.
- Yea, thanks for stepping up for me.

1213
02:11:39,623 --> 02:11:42,246
You are the bravest kid
I've ever seen.

1214
02:11:42,247 --> 02:11:45,102
I'm gonna take care of this jerk, you go take care of your mom...okay?

1215
02:11:45,181 --> 02:11:47,697
Alright, get out of here, go, go.

1216
02:11:54,785 --> 02:11:58,376
Will you fight me,
will you fight me now?

1217
02:11:59,337 --> 02:12:02,879
On behalf of the fine people of New
York city and real rhinos everywhere...

1218
02:12:02,904 --> 02:12:06,187
I ask you to turn your mechanised
paws in the air!

1219
02:12:06,212 --> 02:12:10,531
Never! I can crush you!
I can destroy you!

1220
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:13,509
- You're gonna have me come down there so that you can kill me?
- Yes!

1221
02:12:13,678 --> 02:12:16,941
I'll be right there. Ah...there's
no place like home.
