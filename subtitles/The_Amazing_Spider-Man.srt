1
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,317
...two, one.

2
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:07,944
Ready or not, here I come.

3
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,646
Hey, Dad?

4
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:27,857
Dad!

5
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:32,213
<i>You'll stay with Aunt May...</i>

6
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,174
...and Uncle Ben for a little while.

7
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,509
- I wanna go with you.
- No.

8
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,016
Doesn't like crust
on his sandwiches...

9
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:45,435
...and he likes to sleep
with a little light on.

10
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:47,729
- Mary. Come on, come on.
- Oh, God.

11
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:53,443
Dad.

12
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,987
Be good.

13
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:14,589
Sorry.

14
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:16,591
Morning, Flash.

15
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:21,638
Good morning, Parker.

16
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,979
Hey. It's Peter, right?

17
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:33,233
I really like your photos.

18
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,026
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

19
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,152
Listen...

20
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:37,654
...are you busy Friday night?

21
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:46,162
Cool. Can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

22
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:48,331
You know, I really wanna frame
a good one...

23
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:49,582
...for his birthday.

24
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,836
That's really nice of you.
Wow, that's such a nice thought.

25
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,338
Yeah, I'll have a look at the old...

26
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:57,257
- The old schedule.
- Okay.

27
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,551
Parker.

28
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:01,761
- Yes, sir?
- You want to keep that skateboard?

29
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:03,429
- Yeah.
- Keep it off the ground.

30
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:04,931
- Sure. Yeah.
- Wheels up.

31
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:06,224
Like that?

32
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,101
- That's it.
- Okay.

33
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:35,628
<i>Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!</i>

34
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:37,172
<i>Eat it! Eat it!</i>

35
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,883
<i>Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!</i>

36
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,468
Eat your vegetables, Gordon.
Come on!

37
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,095
Come on!

38
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:45,430
Hey, Parker, come on.

39
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:46,973
Get a picture of this.

40
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,310
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.

41
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,437
- Come on.
- Gordon, don't eat it.

42
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:53,646
Take the picture.

43
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:55,273
Put him down, Flash.

44
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,025
Take the picture.

45
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:59,777
Put him down, Eugene!

46
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:04,157
Hey, man.

47
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:06,659
Come on!

48
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:07,493
Get up, Parker!

49
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:10,914
Get up!

50
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,707
Come on! Come on!

51
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:13,541
Get up!

52
00:06:16,503 --> 00:06:17,837
Still not taking the picture.

53
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:19,672
Stay down, Parker!

54
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:21,674
Who wants one more?

55
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:23,426
- One more!
- Flash!

56
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:25,303
Flash...

57
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,347
...we still on for after school today?

58
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:28,640
My house, 3:30?

59
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,016
I hope you did homework.

60
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:31,684
Last time, I was...

61
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,478
...disappointed in you.

62
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:35,730
- Okay, move.
- No, how about we go to class?

63
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:37,106
How about it?

64
00:06:39,943 --> 00:06:41,486
Whatever.

65
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,471
I thought that was great
what you did.

66
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:10,473
It was stupid...

67
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,225
...but it was great.

68
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:14,102
You should go to...

69
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:16,020
...the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

70
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:19,065
What's your name?

71
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:20,733
You don't know my name?

72
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,902
No, I know your name.

73
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,779
I want to know
if you know your name.

74
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:28,074
Peter.

75
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:31,327
- Parker. Peter Parker.
- Okay. Okay, good.

76
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,587
I'd still go to the nurse though.

77
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,005
You're Gwen, right?

78
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,381
Gwen Stacy.

79
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:45,383
All right.

80
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,303
Hey.

81
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,387
I'm making...

82
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,264
...spaghetti and meatballs tonight.

83
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:54,100
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.

84
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:57,979
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

85
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:00,190
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

86
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:01,900
What happened to your face?

87
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,444
I'm all right. Just-- I fell, skating.

88
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:06,196
It's all right.

89
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:08,907
Ben Parker, don't you even...

90
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:12,035
...think about leaving
that filthy box in my kitchen.

91
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:13,244
My bowling trophies.

92
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,954
Oh, well, then, by all means...

93
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:16,623
...leave that box in my kitchen.

94
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:18,249
- What happened to you?
- He fell.

95
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,211
Why you kids ride those things,
I'll never know.

96
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:22,962
Because it's stupid and dangerous.

97
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:24,756
Remember when we were stupid?

98
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:25,924
No.

99
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,218
- Trust me, we were.
- All right. Good to know.

100
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:29,302
Where's the flood?

101
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:30,970
Follow me. I'll show you.

102
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:32,347
- You serious?
- Yes.

103
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:34,140
All right.

104
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,976
<i>It's the condenser tray.</i>

105
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:40,730
Too much water for the condenser tray
or the heat exchange tubing.

106
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:42,815
This has got to be the fill line.

107
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:45,360
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

108
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:46,861
Can you fix it?

109
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:50,281
No, not tonight.
I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.

110
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,867
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

111
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:56,579
How's the other guy look?

112
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:01,292
Come on.
I know a right cross when I see one.

113
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:05,255
Yes or no?
Do I have to call somebody's father?

114
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:06,714
No, no.

115
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:07,966
All right.

116
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:10,218
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

117
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:13,680
I pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.

118
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:16,933
Before you come up, see if...

119
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,519
...there's anything else worth saving.
- Okay.

120
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:38,663
- Plumbers don't fix appliances.
- Yes, they do.

121
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,415
They fix pipes and pump things.

122
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:42,417
If you ask them to--

123
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:49,382
I forgot all about that thing.

124
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:50,425
It was your dad's.

125
00:09:50,592 --> 00:09:52,427
- Yeah.
- He asked us to keep it safe.

126
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:59,851
He saw it in the window of that
leather shop over on 9th Avenue.

127
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:03,688
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old kid
need with a briefcase?

128
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,648
And guess who sold it to him.

129
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:07,483
- I don't know.
- Your mother.

130
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,735
That's how they met.

131
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:10,695
He asked you to...

132
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,822
...keep this safe?
There's nothing in here.

133
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:14,741
Have you looked?
There's nothing here.

134
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:17,035
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.

135
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,704
Yeah, I know.

136
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:26,711
Who's that?

137
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:28,421
Do you know who that is?

138
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:29,923
Some guy who worked with...

139
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:31,216
...your dad, I guess.

140
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:38,014
Just take this off the table, all right?

141
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:41,226
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.

142
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:43,269
- Now.
- All right.

143
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:44,437
Go on.

144
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:21,683
<i>I need you to be a good boy.</i>

145
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,976
Where are you going?

146
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:24,310
There's something...

147
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:26,479
...your mom and I have to do.

148
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:24,871
What is this?

149
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,001
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."

150
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,422
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

151
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,224
Come in.

152
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:45,725
You okay?

153
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:48,228
- Yeah. What's up?
- Oh, my God.

154
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:49,687
You look just like him.

155
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:52,649
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

156
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,988
Listen...

157
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:00,615
...I don't have much education.

158
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:02,242
You know that, Peter.

159
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,079
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

160
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:08,831
What I'm trying to say is...

161
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:11,751
...I know it's been rough
for you without your dad.

162
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,087
And I know we don't talk
much about them.

163
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:16,172
- Yeah, it's all right.
- No, it is not...

164
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:17,715
...all right.

165
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:21,386
I wish I could change it, but I can't.

166
00:13:23,263 --> 00:13:24,639
Curt Connors.

167
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:28,059
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

168
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:30,562
They worked together for years
and they were close.

169
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:33,106
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

170
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,233
He never even called.

171
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,609
Not once.

172
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:40,738
Go figure.

173
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:45,326
She's pretty.

174
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:51,791
Uncle Ben.

175
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,209
What?

176
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:55,295
You're a pretty great dad.

177
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:52,644
Excuse me.

178
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,603
What?

179
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,355
Can I help you?

180
00:14:55,522 --> 00:14:57,190
I don't know. I'm here to see...

181
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:58,816
...Dr. Connors.
- Right.

182
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,860
You'll find yourself to the left.

183
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,447
You are here for the internship?

184
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:06,699
Yeah. Yeah.

185
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:07,951
Okay.

186
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:09,994
You'll find your badge to the left.

187
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,876
Having trouble finding yourself?

188
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:18,545
No. Yeah, I got it.

189
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:21,881
Okay...

190
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:23,925
...Mr. Guevara.

191
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:29,180
<i>Welcome to Oscorp.</i>

192
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:32,183
<i>Born from the mind of our founder,
Norman Osborn...</i>

193
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,020
<i>...the Oscorp Tower houses
108 floors of innovation.</i>

194
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:41,192
<i>Our scientific minds are pushing the
boundaries of defence, biomedical...</i>

195
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:44,153
<i>...and chemical technologies.
The future lies within.</i>

196
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:45,613
Welcome to Oscorp.

197
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,073
I'm Gwen Stacy, a senior...

198
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,116
...at Midtown Science...

199
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:49,701
...and head intern to Dr. Connors.

200
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:52,036
I'll be with you
for the duration of your visit.

201
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:53,872
Where I go, you go.

202
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:55,748
That's the rule. Remember that...

203
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:57,375
...all will be fine.
- Come on!

204
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:58,918
- If you forget that--
- Listen!

205
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:00,003
Look, listen.

206
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,754
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here.

207
00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:03,006
Just tell them...

208
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:04,215
...Rodrigo Guevara is here!

209
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:05,550
My name's Rodrigo!

210
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:08,553
I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget.

211
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:10,096
Shall we?

212
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:19,731
Come around this way.

213
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:25,111
Good afternoon, Gwen.

214
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:26,237
Dr. Connors.

215
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,156
Welcome.

216
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:31,117
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

217
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:33,536
Yes, in case you're wondering,
I'm a southpaw.

218
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:34,954
I'm not a cripple...

219
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:38,458
...I'm a scientist, and the world's
foremost authority on herpetology.

220
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,377
That's reptiles,
for those of you who don't know.

221
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:43,004
Like the Parkinson's patient...

222
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:45,882
...who watches on in horror
as her body...

223
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:49,469
...slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration...

224
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:53,473
...whose eyes grow dimmer each day,
I long to fix myself.

225
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,477
I want to create a world
without weakness.

226
00:16:57,644 --> 00:17:00,605
Anyone care to venture a guess
just how?

227
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:01,981
Yes.

228
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:03,107
Stem cells?

229
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:04,859
Promising. But the solution...

230
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:07,820
...I'm thinking of is more radical.

231
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:11,658
- No one?
- Cross-species genetics.

232
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,125
Person gets Parkinson's...

233
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:23,670
...when the brain cells
that produce dopamine...

234
00:17:23,837 --> 00:17:25,839
...start to disappear.

235
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:27,674
But a zebra fish has the ability...

236
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:30,051
...to regenerate cells on command.

237
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,136
If you could give this ability...

238
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:35,181
...to the woman you're talking about,
that's that. She's...

239
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:37,559
She's curing herself.

240
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,603
Yeah, you just have to look past
the gills on her neck.

241
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,358
And you are...?

242
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:49,404
He's one of Midtown Science's...

243
00:17:49,571 --> 00:17:51,072
...best and brightest.
- Really?

244
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,240
Second in his class.

245
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:55,201
- Second?
- Yeah.

246
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:56,202
Sure about that?

247
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:57,829
I'm pretty sure.

248
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:05,211
I'm afraid duty calls. I'll leave you in the
more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

249
00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:07,255
Nice meeting you all.

250
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:11,885
If you'd like to gather round.

251
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:14,053
<i>Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.</i>

252
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:17,640
<i>Our planet's tree of life is immense.</i>

253
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:19,350
<i>At Oscorp's...</i>

254
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:21,227
<i>-...Cross-Species Division...
- Hi.</i>

255
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:24,397
<i>...we endeavour to explore
exciting new methods...</i>

256
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:27,025
What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?

257
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:31,321
Oh, yeah.

258
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:32,739
What are you doing here?

259
00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:34,073
I work here. I don't.

260
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,825
I was gonna say I work here...

261
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:39,204
...but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that I don't.

262
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,246
You following me?

263
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:43,541
No, I'm not following you, no.
I had no idea you worked here.

264
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,918
Why would you be here?

265
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:46,920
I just snuck in because...

266
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:48,505
I love science.

267
00:18:48,671 --> 00:18:50,465
- You love it.
- I'm passionate about it.

268
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:52,258
So you snuck in--?

269
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:54,594
- I have to lead this tour group.
- I know.

270
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:57,680
I'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.

271
00:18:57,847 --> 00:19:00,099
- I promise you I won't.
- Stay with the group.

272
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:04,229
All right, guys? I'm gonna take you
to the bioreactor room now.

273
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:09,526
Sorry. Yo.

274
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:12,028
Sorry.

275
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:39,050
We received the results from
the mRNA sequences this morning.

276
00:21:39,217 --> 00:21:42,011
They were disappointing.

277
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:48,935
Define "disappointing."

278
00:21:49,102 --> 00:21:50,436
Another dead end.

279
00:21:50,603 --> 00:21:52,272
It's the decay rate algorithm.

280
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,941
- And this is to be expected.
- Expected?

281
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:56,442
You said you were close.

282
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:58,778
We are close,
but it's gonna take time.

283
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:00,154
He doesn't have time.

284
00:22:00,321 --> 00:22:02,615
Norman Osborn is dying,
Dr. Connors.

285
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:04,409
Save him.

286
00:22:06,703 --> 00:22:08,580
Or we'll both lose our heads.

287
00:22:26,973 --> 00:22:28,433
All right, give me the badge.

288
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:31,978
Give it to me.

289
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:37,025
Sorry.

290
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,296
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.

291
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:43,049
I didn't mean to do that.

292
00:23:43,216 --> 00:23:44,634
I didn't mean to...

293
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:46,553
ldidn't-- I didn't--

294
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:49,055
Get your hand off her!

295
00:23:49,222 --> 00:23:50,890
I'm trying to get my...

296
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:55,478
Are you kidding?

297
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:56,437
I'm sorry.

298
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:57,814
Are you kidding me?

299
00:23:58,398 --> 00:24:00,108
- Hey, get him, Rudy!
- Hey!

300
00:24:03,403 --> 00:24:04,571
Ma". I'm sorry!

301
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:05,822
Man, are you all right?

302
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:10,285
- Take him down!
- Come on.

303
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,497
Get him, man! Get him!

304
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:18,543
No, man, no. Not my board.

305
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,003
Please, dude, don't--

306
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:23,006
Sorry!

307
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,969
Sorry. Sorry.

308
00:24:28,136 --> 00:24:29,429
I'm so sorry.

309
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:35,935
<i>Coney Island, next stop.</i>

310
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:38,062
<i>Next and final stop, Coney Island.</i>

311
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:50,742
Hey.

312
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,244
Hey. HEY-

313
00:24:53,411 --> 00:24:54,621
Sorry. I'm late.

314
00:24:54,787 --> 00:24:56,456
- I got--
- We've been so worried.

315
00:24:56,623 --> 00:24:57,749
I know. I'm sorry.

316
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:59,250
Watch out!

317
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,509
That's a fly, Peter.

318
00:25:11,638 --> 00:25:13,223
Yeah.

319
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,687
I'm so sorry...

320
00:25:19,854 --> 00:25:21,022
...I kept you guys UP-

321
00:25:21,189 --> 00:25:24,526
I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible...

322
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:26,486
...and I'm hungry.

323
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:32,575
Meatloaf.

324
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,329
Drinking?

325
00:25:36,496 --> 00:25:37,539
What's this?

326
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:39,082
I don't think so.

327
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:40,917
This is your meatloaf.

328
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:45,171
This beats all other meat loafs.

329
00:25:46,464 --> 00:25:48,466
Something is very wrong.

330
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:50,134
Yeah.

331
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:52,345
Nobody likes your meatloaf.

332
00:25:58,518 --> 00:26:00,019
I got it.

333
00:26:03,523 --> 00:26:05,859
He took the frozen
macaroni and cheese.

334
00:26:06,568 --> 00:26:07,861
I noticed that.

335
00:26:08,945 --> 00:26:11,656
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like my meatloaf?

336
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:14,117
You could have said that to me
37 years ago.

337
00:26:14,284 --> 00:26:16,953
How many meat loafs
have I made for you?

338
00:29:08,124 --> 00:29:08,875
Peter.

339
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:11,377
What are you doing?

340
00:29:11,544 --> 00:29:13,046
'M...

341
00:29:14,172 --> 00:29:15,131
Homework.

342
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:16,841
Be careful.

343
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:18,593
Sure.

344
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:29,229
Dr. Connors.

345
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:32,732
You don't remember me. I--

346
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:34,150
The intern from the other day.

347
00:29:34,734 --> 00:29:36,402
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

348
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:38,863
I'm sure you're very nice,
but this is a home.

349
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,366
I ask you to make an appointment
with my office.

350
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:42,909
I'm Richard Parker's son.

351
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,376
Peter?

352
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:54,671
I'm afraid...

353
00:29:54,838 --> 00:29:58,132
...I can't help you much. I don't know
why they left or where they...

354
00:29:58,299 --> 00:29:59,050
...were going.

355
00:30:01,845 --> 00:30:03,304
Good reflexes.

356
00:30:03,471 --> 00:30:04,848
Thank you.

357
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:11,938
- Thank you.
- I read your book.

358
00:30:12,105 --> 00:30:13,565
Yeah.

359
00:30:13,731 --> 00:30:14,899
It's something, you know.

360
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:16,860
So you really think...

361
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:19,737
...it's possible, cross-species genetics?
- Yes, of course.

362
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,365
Your father and I
were mocked for our theories.

363
00:30:22,532 --> 00:30:25,285
Not just in the community at large,
but at Oscorp, as well.

364
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:27,579
They called us mad scientists.

365
00:30:28,621 --> 00:30:31,082
And then your father
bred the spiders...

366
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:32,625
...and everything changed.

367
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:34,460
The results were
beyond encouraging.

368
00:30:34,627 --> 00:30:36,588
They were spectacular.

369
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:41,718
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.

370
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:43,845
Including my own.

371
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:45,930
Then it was over.

372
00:30:46,806 --> 00:30:49,726
He was gone.

373
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:52,395
Took his research with him.

374
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:56,065
And I knew without him, I...

375
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:05,241
I----

376
00:31:06,826 --> 00:31:08,995
I was angry.

377
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:13,249
So I stayed away from you...

378
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:15,335
...and your family.

379
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:17,420
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

380
00:31:25,803 --> 00:31:27,430
Say...

381
00:31:28,056 --> 00:31:29,182
Say it worked.

382
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:31,518
Say you got it to work.

383
00:31:32,018 --> 00:31:35,980
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

384
00:31:36,856 --> 00:31:39,025
What could the side effects be?

385
00:31:42,654 --> 00:31:45,823
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

386
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:47,617
The problem was always--

387
00:31:47,784 --> 00:31:49,202
The decay rate algorithm?

388
00:31:52,121 --> 00:31:53,665
- Right.
- Right.

389
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,209
Can I...?

390
00:31:56,376 --> 00:31:58,044
Of course.

391
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:21,901
Extraordinary.

392
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:24,362
How did you come up with this?

393
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,663
Peter, how about coming
to see me at the Tower...

394
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,748
...one day after school?
- Yeah.

395
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:39,711
Thank you.

396
00:33:00,565 --> 00:33:01,357
Number one, Reggie.

397
00:33:01,524 --> 00:33:02,442
Run it, buddy.

398
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:04,152
Let's go. Reggie-

399
00:33:07,572 --> 00:33:08,323
Rejected!

400
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:12,702
You did that on purpose, Flash!

401
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:14,954
I should've.
You better watch your back.

402
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:20,585
Hey.

403
00:33:22,462 --> 00:33:23,421
All right?

404
00:33:30,178 --> 00:33:30,970
Give it up.

405
00:33:36,476 --> 00:33:37,560
Come on, man.

406
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:40,480
One sec.

407
00:33:43,816 --> 00:33:46,277
- Come on, man.
- Why don't you take it from me?

408
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,699
That's right. Take it.

409
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:53,493
Go ahead. Take it.

410
00:34:14,472 --> 00:34:15,306
Just take it.

411
00:34:17,684 --> 00:34:19,853
All right, how about this?

412
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:21,688
All right?

413
00:34:21,855 --> 00:34:22,772
How about that?

414
00:34:27,026 --> 00:34:29,153
- Come on, Flash.
- Flash, stop playing, man.

415
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,447
- Take it from him!
- Come on, Flash. Take it.

416
00:34:31,614 --> 00:34:32,949
Yo, Flash, let's go.

417
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:34,617
- Let's go!
- Do it, Flash.

418
00:34:34,784 --> 00:34:36,536
- Stop playing, man.
- Let's go, Flash.

419
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:38,371
- What are you doing?
- What's up?

420
00:34:40,123 --> 00:34:40,915
What you doing?

421
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,045
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!

422
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:01,227
Peter's behaviour is just...

423
00:35:01,394 --> 00:35:02,187
...unacceptable.

424
00:35:02,353 --> 00:35:03,229
<i>They won't make us pay...</i>

425
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:06,232
-...for the backboard.
- I don't care about the backboard.

426
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:08,109
- Was that true?
- What?

427
00:35:08,276 --> 00:35:10,069
What I heard in there just now.

428
00:35:10,236 --> 00:35:13,198
Did you humiliate that boy?

429
00:35:14,073 --> 00:35:15,241
Yeah, I did.

430
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:17,410
- But--
- But what?

431
00:35:17,577 --> 00:35:19,037
- This guy deserved it.
- Did he?

432
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:20,914
- Yeah.
- Is he the kid that hit you?

433
00:35:23,249 --> 00:35:24,501
Is he?

434
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:26,503
Yeah, yeah, but...

435
00:35:26,669 --> 00:35:28,755
So all this is about getting even.

436
00:35:29,255 --> 00:35:32,759
If so, I guess you must feel pretty good
about yourself now, right?

437
00:35:32,926 --> 00:35:33,927
Am I right or wrong?

438
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:37,514
Yeah, I thought so.

439
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:40,475
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours...

440
00:35:40,642 --> 00:35:42,602
...I had to change shifts at work...

441
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:46,439
...so you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:00. Understood?

442
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:48,399
- Is that understood?
- Yeah.

443
00:35:48,566 --> 00:35:50,276
Okay, good.

444
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:53,738
She looks familiar.

445
00:35:56,282 --> 00:35:57,742
The girl on your computer.

446
00:35:58,409 --> 00:35:59,577
Yeah.

447
00:35:59,702 --> 00:36:02,705
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.

448
00:36:03,414 --> 00:36:05,124
Don't forget Aunt May.

449
00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:10,630
Okay.

450
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,219
He's a character.

451
00:36:16,344 --> 00:36:17,387
That's my uncle.

452
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:19,597
He's a pathological liar.

453
00:36:19,764 --> 00:36:21,140
He thought you were someone else.

454
00:36:21,307 --> 00:36:23,810
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?

455
00:36:23,977 --> 00:36:27,105
I took a photo of the debate team,
and you're in the debate team.

456
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:28,982
- Right.
- So...

457
00:36:29,148 --> 00:36:31,484
...he must have seen--
I was touching up stuff.

458
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:33,820
- Touching up stuff?
- Come on.

459
00:36:34,487 --> 00:36:36,656
I was... I'm not gonna answer that.

460
00:36:38,741 --> 00:36:41,244
- Did you get expelled?
- No, no.

461
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:43,621
I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.

462
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:49,878
So you want to-- I don't know...?

463
00:36:51,379 --> 00:36:52,172
Want to what?

464
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,048
I don't know.

465
00:36:54,215 --> 00:36:55,925
Just...

466
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:03,641
I don't know-- We could...

467
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:06,603
We could do something else,
or we could--

468
00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:09,230
- If you don't feel like, we could--
- Yeah.

469
00:37:09,397 --> 00:37:10,940
- Yeah?
- Yeah, either one.

470
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:14,485
- Really?
- Sure.

471
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:16,196
Okay.

472
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:17,697
All right, good. Sounds good.

473
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:18,823
Cool.

474
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:20,867
Okay.

475
00:37:21,034 --> 00:37:23,369
- I can't right now, I can't right now.
- Yeah, no.

476
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:25,705
- I'm so busy right now.
- I know, me too.

477
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:30,877
But maybe...

478
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:33,213
- Yeah, just, you know...
- Some other...

479
00:37:33,379 --> 00:37:35,048
- Time, all right.
- Okay.

480
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:36,883
- Bye.
- All right.

481
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:07,515
We have protein structure, rDNA...

482
00:39:07,682 --> 00:39:09,767
...chromatography,
transgenics testing...

483
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:13,188
...that's X-ray video. That's the only
one on the planet. We have...

484
00:39:13,605 --> 00:39:16,149
- Human line testing over--
- I remember that.

485
00:39:16,316 --> 00:39:17,984
I've seen that before.

486
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:19,444
The Ganali device.

487
00:39:19,611 --> 00:39:22,322
Yeah, I remember a picture of that
in my dad's office.

488
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:24,991
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

489
00:39:25,116 --> 00:39:28,620
It creates a cloud which can be dispersed
over a neighbourhood, even a city.

490
00:39:28,745 --> 00:39:32,165
Theoretically, you could
cure polio in an afternoon.

491
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,334
That's incredible.

492
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:37,754
Well, others disagreed. What if
the device were loaded with a toxin?

493
00:39:37,921 --> 00:39:39,923
What if you wanted to opt out?
You can't...

494
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:43,510
...run away from a cloud after all,
so here it lies, gathering dust.

495
00:39:44,344 --> 00:39:46,971
What you see here
is a computer model of a lizard.

496
00:39:47,138 --> 00:39:50,350
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted...

497
00:39:50,517 --> 00:39:53,019
...that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

498
00:39:53,186 --> 00:39:55,021
You can imagine my envy.

499
00:39:55,188 --> 00:39:57,106
We're trying to harness
this capability...

500
00:39:57,273 --> 00:39:59,526
...and transfer it
into our host subject:

501
00:39:59,692 --> 00:40:01,945
Freddy the three-legged mouse.

502
00:40:02,987 --> 00:40:05,156
Enter the algorithm now.

503
00:40:08,368 --> 00:40:09,327
Need to take that?

504
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:16,125
<i>System ready...</i>

505
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:17,877
<i>...for gene insertion.</i>

506
00:40:18,044 --> 00:40:19,671
Okay.

507
00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:21,589
Check.

508
00:40:23,466 --> 00:40:24,676
See what I'm trying to do?

509
00:40:24,843 --> 00:40:26,719
- Preempt the proteins.
- The immune response.

510
00:40:26,886 --> 00:40:28,054
<i>Beginning trials.</i>

00:40:52,078 --> 00:40:53,705
Extraordinary.

524
00:40:57,876 --> 00:40:59,752
And thank you.

525
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:01,629
Meet Fred and Wilma...

526
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:03,089
...our three-legged...

527
00:41:03,256 --> 00:41:04,382
...mice.

528
00:41:07,468 --> 00:41:08,511
Here you go.

529
00:41:10,346 --> 00:41:12,015
HEY. buddy. I got you.

530
00:41:13,725 --> 00:41:14,642
Okay.

531
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:16,895
Careful, don't want to stick you
by mistake.

532
00:41:17,061 --> 00:41:18,938
Human trials aren't until next week.

533
00:41:21,858 --> 00:41:22,734
There.

534
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:31,868
Hey.

535
00:41:32,035 --> 00:41:34,412
Hey, I thought you...

536
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,497
Didn't you forget something?

537
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,416
What?

538
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:42,420
Now, don't answer that,
but I'm glad to know it's working.

539
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:47,383
You owe your aunt
an apology bigtime.

540
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:50,386
Be a man.

541
00:41:50,512 --> 00:41:52,263
Get in there and apologise.

542
00:41:55,725 --> 00:41:57,227
I'm sorry, Aunt May, I...

543
00:41:57,352 --> 00:41:58,686
Honestly, you don't have...

544
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:00,438
...to apologise to me. It's your--

545
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:02,398
- The hell he doesn't.
- Ben.

546
00:42:03,274 --> 00:42:05,151
Look, I'm sorry, I got distracted.

547
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:07,237
- Oh, he got distracted.
- Yeah.

548
00:42:07,403 --> 00:42:10,532
Your aunt, my wife,
had to walk 12 blocks alone...

549
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:14,160
...in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station...

550
00:42:14,327 --> 00:42:15,578
...because you got distracted.

551
00:42:15,745 --> 00:42:17,413
Ben, sweetheart, honestly...

552
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,624
...I am completely capable
of walking home--

553
00:42:19,749 --> 00:42:21,835
You will not defend this boy!

554
00:42:22,001 --> 00:42:23,294
- I'm not defending--
- You are!

555
00:42:23,419 --> 00:42:25,964
- Listen to me, son.
- Yeah, go ahead.

556
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,674
You're a lot like your father.

557
00:42:27,841 --> 00:42:30,343
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing...

558
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:33,638
...but your father lived by a philosophy,
a principle, really.

559
00:42:33,805 --> 00:42:37,141
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people...

560
00:42:37,308 --> 00:42:39,769
...you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

561
00:42:39,936 --> 00:42:41,521
That's what's at stake here.

562
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:42,689
Not choice.

563
00:42:42,856 --> 00:42:44,858
Responsibility.

564
00:42:47,026 --> 00:42:49,529
That is nice. That's great.

565
00:42:50,446 --> 00:42:52,657
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

566
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:55,743
- What?
- Where is he?

567
00:42:56,077 --> 00:42:57,871
Where's my dad?

568
00:42:58,037 --> 00:43:01,541
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me himself?

569
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,042
Oh, come on, how dare you?

570
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:04,919
How dare I? How dare you?

571
00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:10,550
Where you going?

572
00:43:10,717 --> 00:43:12,510
Peter, come back here, please.

573
00:43:22,061 --> 00:43:25,190
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He'll be all right.

574
00:43:38,203 --> 00:43:39,204
Peter!

575
00:43:41,873 --> 00:43:43,416
Peter?

576
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,423
Peter!

577
00:43:55,512 --> 00:43:56,471
It's $2.07.

578
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:00,975
It's $2.07.

579
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:02,477
Yeah. No, I know.

580
00:44:02,644 --> 00:44:05,480
Yeah, you're holding up the line. No.

581
00:44:05,605 --> 00:44:07,941
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

582
00:44:09,025 --> 00:44:10,276
- What?
- You can leave...

583
00:44:10,485 --> 00:44:13,112
...a penny anytime,
you have to spend 10 dollars...

584
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:15,198
...to take a penny.
It's store policy.

585
00:44:15,365 --> 00:44:17,784
- You're holding up my line.
- I don't have 2 cents.

586
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,619
You can't afford milk, step aside.

587
00:44:19,786 --> 00:44:22,038
Daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?

588
00:44:22,205 --> 00:44:23,540
We're talking about 2 cents.

589
00:44:23,706 --> 00:44:24,749
Just step aside, kid.

590
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:32,674
Really?

591
00:44:45,812 --> 00:44:47,438
Yo, not cool, bro.

592
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:51,317
Hey, man, stop!

593
00:44:51,442 --> 00:44:52,944
Somebody stop that guy!

594
00:44:53,111 --> 00:44:54,487
Hey, kid, little help?

595
00:44:54,612 --> 00:44:56,030
Not my policy.

596
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,657
Somebody stop that dude!

597
00:44:58,658 --> 00:44:59,325
Hey!

598
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:00,785
Hey, stop!

599
00:45:01,911 --> 00:45:03,580
Somebody stop that dude!

600
00:45:12,255 --> 00:45:13,131
Hey!

601
00:45:43,661 --> 00:45:45,538
Oh, God, oh, God.

602
00:45:45,705 --> 00:45:47,248
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

603
00:45:47,874 --> 00:45:49,501
Call an ambulance!

604
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:52,086
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

605
00:45:52,712 --> 00:45:54,380
Oh, God, oh, my God.

606
00:45:58,051 --> 00:45:59,761
On, God.

607
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:04,516
No.

608
00:46:06,684 --> 00:46:08,645
Oh, Jesus.

609
00:46:12,565 --> 00:46:16,528
Witnesses gave a description to the
sketch artist. I need you to take a look.

610
00:46:20,907 --> 00:46:22,742
No, I don't know him.

611
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:26,454
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives...

612
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:28,581
...are on it.
We'll see what they turn up.

613
00:46:28,748 --> 00:46:30,416
Okay.

614
00:46:35,964 --> 00:46:37,382
Can I have that?

615
00:46:37,549 --> 00:46:38,925
Sure.

616
00:46:41,261 --> 00:46:43,221
There's one other thing.
He has a star...

617
00:46:43,388 --> 00:46:44,138
<i>tattooed...</i>

618
00:46:44,305 --> 00:46:45,557
<i>...on his left hand.</i>

619
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:17,547
<i>Peter, I know things
have been difficult lately...</i>

620
00:47:18,006 --> 00:47:19,841
<i>...and I'm sorry about that.</i>

621
00:47:20,425 --> 00:47:22,635
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

622
00:47:38,776 --> 00:47:40,445
Hey, Parker.

623
00:47:41,446 --> 00:47:43,573
- Not today.
- Come on, I just want to talk.

624
00:47:48,828 --> 00:47:50,663
It feels better, right?

625
00:47:51,664 --> 00:47:53,166
Look, your uncle died.

626
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:55,293
I'm sorry.

627
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,920
I get it.

628
00:47:57,337 --> 00:47:58,880
I'm sorry.

629
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:00,840
Okay?

630
00:48:07,138 --> 00:48:08,389
Peter.

631
00:48:51,933 --> 00:48:53,059
Stay away from him.

632
00:48:53,226 --> 00:48:54,227
- You understand?
- Hey!

633
00:48:54,394 --> 00:48:55,812
- Stay away from Joey.
- Hey!

634
00:48:58,064 --> 00:48:59,357
You like beating on girls?

635
00:48:59,691 --> 00:49:01,067
You like beating on old men?

636
00:49:01,234 --> 00:49:01,901
Hey, pal...

637
00:49:02,068 --> 00:49:02,861
...keep walking.

638
00:49:03,027 --> 00:49:05,446
- You're in the wrong place.
- When were you in Queens?

639
00:49:06,072 --> 00:49:07,282
I asked you a question.

640
00:49:07,448 --> 00:49:08,366
Nicky, no!

641
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:09,242
That the gun?

642
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:10,493
You gonna kill me too?

643
00:49:12,495 --> 00:49:13,621
Hey! Stop it!

644
00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:15,456
Hey. get off!

645
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:17,876
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!

646
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,252
Back up!

647
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,046
This guy is crazy!

648
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:23,923
Get him!

649
00:49:28,428 --> 00:49:30,680
Get back here, man! Get him!

650
00:49:37,437 --> 00:49:38,271
Follow him!

651
00:49:41,983 --> 00:49:43,651
- Go around, man!
- I'll follow you!

652
00:49:53,036 --> 00:49:53,786
Go, go, go!

653
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:56,331
There he is!

654
00:49:56,497 --> 00:49:57,332
Can't get away!

655
00:50:13,973 --> 00:50:15,808
<i>He has a star tattooed
on his left hand.</i>

656
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:28,571
Oh, yeah?

657
00:50:28,738 --> 00:50:29,739
Come on!

658
00:50:37,163 --> 00:50:38,706
I know what you look like!

659
00:50:38,873 --> 00:50:40,667
You hear me?

660
00:50:41,084 --> 00:50:43,461
I've seen your face!

661
00:51:21,207 --> 00:51:22,876
Is that all you got?

662
00:51:24,544 --> 00:51:26,045
Just take it, take it.

663
00:51:31,384 --> 00:51:34,220
<i>Engineered from
genetically enhanced spiders...</i>

664
00:51:34,387 --> 00:51:38,808
<i>...Oscorp's BioCable tensile strength
is unparalleled. We're just beginning...</i>

665
00:51:38,975 --> 00:51:42,729
<i>...to understand all the potential
industrial applications.</i>

666
00:51:42,896 --> 00:51:46,399
<i>A single pellet can safely store
several hundred metres...</i>

667
00:51:46,566 --> 00:51:48,401
<i>...of the lightweight cable.</i>

668
00:51:57,368 --> 00:51:58,161
Mother...

669
00:52:55,677 --> 00:53:00,348
<i>Attention, all units in the confines
of Precinct 13, receiving a 10-30...</i>

670
00:53:00,515 --> 00:53:02,809
<i>...on West 19th Street
and Broadway.</i>

671
00:53:02,976 --> 00:53:05,728
<i>Assailant is Caucasian male,

672
00:53:05,895 --> 00:53:08,815
<i>...170 to 180 pounds...</i>

673
00:53:08,982 --> 00:53:10,358
<i>...shoulder-length blond hair.</i>

674
00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:13,152
<i>Last seen on foot
heading eastbound on 19th Street.</i>

675
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,047
Hey.

676
00:53:41,806 --> 00:53:42,849
You got a description?

677
00:53:43,016 --> 00:53:44,225
Well, no, he wears a mask.

678
00:53:44,851 --> 00:53:46,019
A mask?

679
00:53:46,186 --> 00:53:47,353
Most of his victims...

680
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,899
...are suspects with serious rap sheets.
They're calling him a vigilante.

681
00:53:51,065 --> 00:53:53,443
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

682
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,237
Help me, somebody! Arrest me!

683
00:53:56,404 --> 00:53:57,530
Get me out of here.

684
00:53:58,948 --> 00:54:00,283
Hey, look!

685
00:54:11,419 --> 00:54:13,379
Spandex. Spandex.

686
00:54:14,172 --> 00:54:15,173
Everything...

687
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,216
...spandex.

688
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:18,718
Extraordinary velocity vector
is a function...

689
00:54:18,885 --> 00:54:20,720
...of both mass and acceleration.

690
00:54:20,887 --> 00:54:22,680
Come on,
you know better than anyone...

691
00:54:22,847 --> 00:54:25,308
...the weight on any pendulum
has no effect on speed.

692
00:54:25,475 --> 00:54:29,229
It doesn't affect frequency,
but it's totally a factor in momentum.

693
00:55:05,598 --> 00:55:07,058
Hey, Aunt May.

694
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:09,561
Yeah.Eggs?

695
00:55:09,727 --> 00:55:10,979
Organic, got it.

696
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:11,437

697
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,722
In the future,
if you're gonna steal cars...

698
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:47,849
...don't dress like a car thief, man.

699
00:55:48,016 --> 00:55:49,559
What are you? You a cop?

700
00:55:50,393 --> 00:55:54,647
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

701
00:55:54,814 --> 00:55:56,316
You know, you're...

702
00:55:57,066 --> 00:55:58,484
You've got a mind...

703
00:55:58,651 --> 00:56:00,111
...of the true scholar, sir.

704
00:56:00,278 --> 00:56:02,655
I was going more for the guys
who do the luge.

705
00:56:03,198 --> 00:56:04,324
Good thinking.

706
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,034
Get out the window.

707
00:56:06,201 --> 00:56:07,493
There you go. You got it.

708
00:56:15,919 --> 00:56:17,337
Crotch!

709
00:56:20,173 --> 00:56:22,509
- Just let me go.
- Is that a real knife?

710
00:56:22,675 --> 00:56:23,843
Yes, it's a real knife.

711
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,512
My weakness, it's small knives.

712
00:56:25,678 --> 00:56:27,263
- Just let me go.
- Anything but...

713
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,349
...knives! Oh, it's so simple.

714
00:56:29,516 --> 00:56:30,975
- That was cool.
- What is this?

715
00:56:31,142 --> 00:56:33,728
Webbing I developed.
I don't think you want to know.

716
00:56:33,895 --> 00:56:34,562
Let me go!

717
00:56:36,481 --> 00:56:38,191
Okay, one second.
Hold on, one second.

718
00:56:38,358 --> 00:56:39,484
Knock it off, man. No!

719
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:43,029
Come on, let me go. Stop it!

720
00:56:43,863 --> 00:56:44,906
That isn't funny.

721
00:56:45,073 --> 00:56:46,533
- It is kind of funny.
- Help!

722
00:56:57,418 --> 00:56:58,878
This could've gone a lot worse.

723
00:56:59,045 --> 00:57:01,005
Now hold still.

724
00:57:06,553 --> 00:57:07,887
Boys in blue here.

725
00:57:08,054 --> 00:57:10,557
- Yo, I got him.
- Freeze!

726
00:57:10,723 --> 00:57:12,559
- He's not going anywhere.
- Don't move.

727
00:57:12,725 --> 00:57:13,726
You serious?

728
00:57:13,893 --> 00:57:15,061
Who are you?

729
00:57:15,478 --> 00:57:17,188
No one grasps
the concept of the mask.

730
00:57:17,355 --> 00:57:18,147
Freeze!

731
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:22,735
I just did 80 percent of your job.

732
00:57:23,278 --> 00:57:24,028
And that?

733
00:57:24,195 --> 00:57:25,113
That's how you repay me?

734
00:57:28,741 --> 00:57:29,909
Hold it right there!

735
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,973
Well, that was fun.

736
00:57:53,433 --> 00:57:55,059
Bus! Hey there, everybody.

737
00:57:59,022 --> 00:58:00,148
What are you doing?

738
00:58:04,736 --> 00:58:05,820
Hey, watch out.

739
00:58:05,987 --> 00:58:07,113
I'm swinging here.

740
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,781
I'm swinging here.

741
00:58:23,922 --> 00:58:26,674
So 38 of New York's finest...

742
00:58:26,841 --> 00:58:30,011
...versus one guy in a unitard.

743
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:32,138
Am I correct?

744
00:58:46,152 --> 00:58:47,695
You don't have to wait up for me.

745
00:58:47,862 --> 00:58:49,155
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

746
00:58:49,322 --> 00:58:50,323
Yes, I do.

747
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:51,824
- Okay.
- Where were you?

748
00:58:51,991 --> 00:58:53,034
I was out.

749
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:55,161
Did you get the eggs?

750
00:58:56,704 --> 00:58:58,206
Nope. Forgot the eggs.

751
00:58:58,373 --> 00:58:59,582
I'm gonna get them now.

752
00:58:59,749 --> 00:59:01,334
No, you most certainly will not.

753
00:59:01,501 --> 00:59:03,503
Not at this hour.

754
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:07,215
Look at me, Peter.

755
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:11,553
Take off the damn hood
and look at me.

756
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:22,355
Peter. Where do you go?

757
00:59:22,522 --> 00:59:23,982
Who does this to you?

758
00:59:24,148 --> 00:59:25,942
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

759
00:59:26,109 --> 00:59:28,111
- Please tell me.
- Aunt May, please...

760
00:59:28,278 --> 00:59:30,321
...please, please go to sleep.

761
00:59:30,488 --> 00:59:33,533
I can't sleep.
Don't you understand? I can't sleep.

762
00:59:45,044 --> 00:59:47,547
Peter, listen to me.

763
00:59:48,256 --> 00:59:49,465
Secrets have a cost.

764
00:59:49,632 --> 00:59:51,176
They're not for free.

765
00:59:51,342 --> 00:59:53,553
Not now, not ever.

766
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:03,229
Cross-species genetics
is finally working.

767
01:00:03,563 --> 01:00:06,733
I've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.

768
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,484
It's a miracle.

769
01:00:08,651 --> 01:00:10,236
No, it's hard work and promise.

770
01:00:10,403 --> 01:00:14,324
- It's a step closer to the primate lab.
- He doesn't have time for every little step.

771
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:15,408
Little?

772
01:00:15,575 --> 01:00:17,118
I just mean he can't wait.

773
01:00:17,285 --> 01:00:18,953
Well, he'll have to.

774
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:21,039
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

775
01:00:21,206 --> 01:00:22,081
That's not what...

776
01:00:22,248 --> 01:00:23,082
...I'm saying-

777
01:00:23,249 --> 01:00:24,417
So, what are you saying?

778
01:00:25,084 --> 01:00:27,378
You have to start human trials.

779
01:00:28,087 --> 01:00:28,838
Now.

780
01:00:29,005 --> 01:00:31,174
No, I don't, and no, I won't.

781
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:33,301
- Well, then he's going to die.
- People die.

782
01:00:34,594 --> 01:00:36,513
Even Norman Osborn.

783
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:37,680
We are not finished.

784
01:00:37,847 --> 01:00:39,432
Human trials?

785
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,185
Where are you going
to find the people to volunteer?

786
01:00:42,352 --> 01:00:44,938
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a flu shot.

787
01:00:45,104 --> 01:00:47,982
I might think the Veterans Hospital
is a place to start.

788
01:00:48,149 --> 01:00:49,484
You've gotta be kidding me.

789
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:51,694
I don't think I am.

790
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:00,453
It's a little late for
shock and indignation.

791
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:01,746
About 15 years late.

792
01:01:01,955 --> 01:01:03,790
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

793
01:01:03,957 --> 01:01:05,458
Richard Parker wore it well.

794
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:08,461
On you, it's a cheap suit,
as it was then.

795
01:01:08,628 --> 01:01:10,088
I had nothing to do with that.

796
01:01:10,255 --> 01:01:11,798
Is that what you told his son?

797
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:18,763
I don't know what you're saying.

798
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:21,474
You don't know,
or you don't wanna know?

799
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,311
I'll remind you what happened.

800
01:01:25,478 --> 01:01:28,940
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

801
01:01:31,317 --> 01:01:34,487
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

802
01:01:35,488 --> 01:01:37,240
I----

803
01:01:44,873 --> 01:01:46,499
I won't.

804
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:50,336
Fine.

805
01:01:54,924 --> 01:01:57,635
The formula is ours now anyway.

806
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,598
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

807
01:02:01,764 --> 01:02:03,308
I'm shutting you down.

808
01:02:03,474 --> 01:02:06,394
Have your office cleared out
by the morning.

809
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:10,064
Your toys can be taken away too,
you know.

810
01:02:12,192 --> 01:02:13,276
Right, Freddy?

811
01:02:28,499 --> 01:02:29,542
- Hey.
- Hi.

812
01:02:29,709 --> 01:02:30,502
How's it going?

813
01:02:30,668 --> 01:02:31,878
Where you headed?

814
01:02:32,879 --> 01:02:35,423
- Monday, B track.
- Oh, it's Thursday.

815
01:02:35,924 --> 01:02:37,550
- It's Thursday?
- What happened?

816
01:02:37,717 --> 01:02:39,385
- What?
- Your eye, it looks bruised.

817
01:02:39,552 --> 01:02:40,803
Oh, yeah, no, I don't...

818
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:42,597
Maybe I got a rash or...

819
01:02:42,764 --> 01:02:44,557
It's bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?

820
01:02:46,809 --> 01:02:48,520
Do you like branzino?

821
01:02:49,562 --> 01:02:50,897
Like, a fish

822
01:02:51,064 --> 01:02:52,899
No, no. I know. I know.

823
01:02:53,066 --> 01:02:55,276
Well, if you want...

824
01:02:55,443 --> 01:02:59,948
...you can come to this address
at 8:00 tonight.

825
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:02,408
My mom's making branzino.

826
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:04,327
So...

827
01:03:04,536 --> 01:03:05,370
It's apartment...

828
01:03:05,537 --> 01:03:07,872
...2016. I didn't write that part down.

829
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:09,374
I don't know why I...

830
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:11,376
- I'll remember it.
- Oh, okay.

831
01:03:11,543 --> 01:03:12,919
2016.

832
01:04:20,987 --> 01:04:22,322
Hi.

833
01:04:23,656 --> 01:04:24,908
How did you get out there?

834
01:04:25,783 --> 01:04:27,327
The fire escape.

835
01:04:28,494 --> 01:04:29,996
Your doorman's intimidating.

836
01:04:30,914 --> 01:04:32,540
It's 20 storeys.

837
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:34,334
Yeah. It's all right.

838
01:04:38,505 --> 01:04:40,507
- This is your room.
- Yes, this is my room.

839
01:04:40,673 --> 01:04:42,342
Books.

840
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:44,010
Shoes.

841
01:04:44,636 --> 01:04:46,137
Oh, hey...

842
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:48,556
I got your mom...

843
01:04:48,723 --> 01:04:50,099
...these.

844
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:51,351
Oh, lovely.

845
01:04:51,518 --> 01:04:53,186
- Beautiful, right?
- Beautiful.

846
01:04:53,353 --> 01:04:54,729
They were nice.

847
01:04:54,896 --> 01:04:56,689
- No, they're beautiful.
- I'm sorry.

848
01:04:56,856 --> 01:04:59,609
No, it's impressive.
They actually held together very well.

849
01:04:59,776 --> 01:05:01,319
I'm gonna keep these.

850
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:03,530
You have your suit in there?

851
01:05:06,574 --> 01:05:08,243
My Suit?

852
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:10,787
It's for dinner. Are you gonna--?

853
01:05:10,954 --> 01:05:12,080
Are you gonna wear that?

854
01:05:12,247 --> 01:05:13,248
- That's--
- Hey, hon.

855
01:05:18,878 --> 01:05:19,796
You must be Peter.

856
01:05:19,963 --> 01:05:21,798
Dad, this is Peter.

857
01:05:24,467 --> 01:05:25,677
Nice to meet you, sir.

858
01:05:26,886 --> 01:05:28,012
Nice to meet you.

859
01:05:28,179 --> 01:05:29,764
Dinner's ready.

860
01:05:30,557 --> 01:05:31,891
Hope you like branzino.

861
01:05:32,058 --> 01:05:33,601
Who doesn't?

862
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:34,454
<i>Emma, it's Curt.</i>

863
01:06:35,205 --> 01:06:37,415
<i>- Is he there?
- I'm afraid not, doctor.</i>

864
01:06:37,582 --> 01:06:40,418
<i>The car is taking him
to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.</i>

865
01:06:40,585 --> 01:06:41,794
No. He can't, Emma.

866
01:06:41,961 --> 01:06:44,255
You have to stop him. He--

867
01:06:44,422 --> 01:06:46,841
<i>I would, but I always lose him
on the bridge.</i>

868
01:06:47,008 --> 01:06:49,969
<i>I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns
your call as soon as possible.</i>

869
01:06:59,979 --> 01:07:03,316
I'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. I'm in a hurry.

870
01:07:03,483 --> 01:07:05,527
You want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?

871
01:07:05,693 --> 01:07:06,945
Bridge! Take the bridge.

872
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:08,446
All right, we'll do that.

873
01:07:08,613 --> 01:07:09,697
Hey, you all right...

874
01:07:09,864 --> 01:07:10,615
...back there?

875
01:07:11,533 --> 01:07:12,200
You tweaking...

876
01:07:12,367 --> 01:07:13,576
...man?

877
01:07:14,702 --> 01:07:16,329
Just drive.

878
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:18,122
Okay.

879
01:07:24,379 --> 01:07:25,880
You're having trouble there?

880
01:07:26,047 --> 01:07:27,715
The head goes on the other--

881
01:07:27,882 --> 01:07:29,425
Help Gwen's friend with his fish.

882
01:07:29,592 --> 01:07:30,802
On, I...

883
01:07:30,969 --> 01:07:32,053
I got no idea.

884
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,763
First time.

885
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,515
- Branzino.
- George.

886
01:07:35,682 --> 01:07:38,434
- Tell us about your day.
- Did you catch that spider guy yet?

887
01:07:38,601 --> 01:07:40,186
No, we didn't catch him yet.

888
01:07:40,353 --> 01:07:42,230
But we will. He's an amateur...

889
01:07:42,397 --> 01:07:45,108
...who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

890
01:07:45,275 --> 01:07:47,151
He's clumsy, he leaves clues...

891
01:07:47,318 --> 01:07:48,695
...but he's still dangerous.

892
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:51,030
He's assaulting people?

893
01:07:52,866 --> 01:07:53,867
I'm not sure.

894
01:07:54,033 --> 01:07:55,493
I mean, I saw that video...

895
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,620
...with him and the car thief, and...

896
01:07:57,787 --> 01:08:00,915
I think most people
would say that he was...

897
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:03,042
...providing a public service.

898
01:08:03,751 --> 01:08:05,712
Most people would be wrong.

899
01:08:07,005 --> 01:08:10,466
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

900
01:08:10,633 --> 01:08:11,885
So why wasn't he then?

901
01:08:15,889 --> 01:08:16,931
Let me illuminate you.

902
01:08:17,098 --> 01:08:19,726
The car thief was leading us
to the people who run...

903
01:08:19,893 --> 01:08:22,103
...the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.

904
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:25,273
It's called strategy.
I'm sure you're aware of the term?

905
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,942
- You've heard about that in school?
- Yeah.

906
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:28,985
Good.

907
01:08:29,152 --> 01:08:30,403
<i>I know.</i>

908
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:33,239
- He didn't know you had a plan.
- You seem to know...

909
01:08:33,406 --> 01:08:35,158
...a lot about this.
Know something we don't?

910
01:08:35,325 --> 01:08:37,619
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm not on anyone's side.

911
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:39,162
I saw a video on the lnternet--

912
01:08:39,329 --> 01:08:40,872
You saw the video on the Internet.

913
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:43,249
- Well, then the case is closed.
- Well, no.

914
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:44,375
If you watch the video--

915
01:08:44,542 --> 01:08:46,002
Maybe send you a link?

916
01:08:46,169 --> 01:08:47,837
It looks like he's trying to help.

917
01:08:48,004 --> 01:08:50,882
On the Internet he's being made out
to look like a hero.

918
01:08:51,049 --> 01:08:51,716
No, no.

919
01:08:51,883 --> 01:08:53,593
I'm not saying he's a hero.

920
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,095
- What are you trying to say?
- He's trying to help.

921
01:08:56,262 --> 01:08:57,597
He's trying to do something
the police can't.

922
01:08:57,764 --> 01:08:59,140
Something the police can't?

923
01:08:59,307 --> 01:09:00,850
- I don't know.
- What do you think we do?

924
01:09:01,017 --> 01:09:02,560
Sit around eating doughnuts...

925
01:09:02,727 --> 01:09:04,521
...with our thumbs
planted up our asses?

926
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:06,731
- George. George.
- Daddy.

927
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:07,649
- Up your what?
- Howard.

928
01:09:07,815 --> 01:09:09,651
He stands for what you stand for.

929
01:09:09,817 --> 01:09:11,361
Protecting innocent people
from bad guys.

930
01:09:11,528 --> 01:09:13,613
I stand for law and order.
That's what I stand for.

931
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:15,365
Okay? I wear a badge.

932
01:09:15,532 --> 01:09:18,576
This guy wears a mask
like an outlaw.

933
01:09:18,743 --> 01:09:21,287
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same...

934
01:09:21,454 --> 01:09:23,623
...like he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

935
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:26,793
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

936
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,795
Let's get some air, Peter.

937
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,589
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Yes, we do.

938
01:09:33,967 --> 01:09:35,802
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry...

939
01:09:35,969 --> 01:09:38,221
...if I insulted you.
It was not my intention.

940
01:09:38,429 --> 01:09:41,724
- You're welcome.
- Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.

941
01:09:41,891 --> 01:09:43,977
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

942
01:09:45,687 --> 01:09:48,231
- Dad.
- Yeah?

943
01:09:54,988 --> 01:09:56,906
Well, that was something.

944
01:09:58,366 --> 01:10:01,452
I'm sorry. I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.

945
01:10:01,619 --> 01:10:04,247
No, I wouldn't
have let him arrest you

946
01:10:09,002 --> 01:10:11,713
- What happened to your face?
- I wanna tell you something.

947
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:14,841
Okay.

948
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:21,264
I've been bitten...

949
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,477
So have I.

950
01:10:31,941 --> 01:10:33,359
Okay.

951
01:10:34,861 --> 01:10:37,363
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

952
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:39,282
I gotta tell you this thing about...

953
01:10:39,449 --> 01:10:42,285
...the vigilante and the car thief.
- Oh, okay.

954
01:10:42,452 --> 01:10:44,120
What?

955
01:10:44,287 --> 01:10:46,539
- No, no, no.
- I don't want to talk about that.

956
01:10:46,706 --> 01:10:48,374
Forget that.
I won't talk about that.

957
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:50,793
- I'm gonna talk about me, okay?
- What about you?

958
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,797
It's impo-- I wish I could just--

959
01:10:54,964 --> 01:10:56,216
I can't. It's hard to say.

960
01:10:56,382 --> 01:10:57,383
Just say it.

961
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:59,677
- I don't know.
- Say it.

962
01:11:02,514 --> 01:11:03,806
What? What?

963
01:11:07,268 --> 01:11:08,978
What?

964
01:11:13,024 --> 01:11:14,901
Okay, then forget it.

965
01:11:23,034 --> 01:11:24,494
You...?

966
01:11:33,127 --> 01:11:35,255
- You're Spider-Man.
- Shut up.

967
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:41,761
Gwen?

968
01:11:43,012 --> 01:11:44,347
Gwen...

969
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:47,308
Your father wants you to come inside.

970
01:11:47,725 --> 01:11:48,935
Okay.

971
01:11:49,102 --> 01:11:50,103
- Okay?
- Yeah.

972
01:11:52,897 --> 01:11:53,940
Gwen.

973
01:11:54,065 --> 01:11:55,775
I'm coming.

974
01:12:27,265 --> 01:12:29,058
Oh, I'm in trouble.

975
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:29,517

976
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:53,458
Will you please...

977
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:55,502
...find out what is going on, Alfred?

978
01:13:02,926 --> 01:13:03,801
Excellent.

979
01:13:07,096 --> 01:13:08,097
Hey!

980
01:13:10,892 --> 01:13:12,227
Hey! What is that?

981
01:13:12,352 --> 01:13:14,270
- Oh, my God!
- I don't know!

982
01:13:14,395 --> 01:13:15,855
Get back in the car!

983
01:13:20,944 --> 01:13:22,320
Help!

984
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:24,906
Help!

985
01:14:05,029 --> 01:14:07,240
Incoming!

986
01:14:28,219 --> 01:14:28,928
Somebody help!

987
01:14:29,762 --> 01:14:31,431
Help me! My kid is trapped!

988
01:14:41,191 --> 01:14:42,358
I want my dad!

989
01:14:42,692 --> 01:14:43,735
Dad!

990
01:14:43,902 --> 01:14:45,278
'HeY,hey,hey
- Help!

991
01:14:45,445 --> 01:14:46,112
L-ley, buddy.

992
01:14:46,237 --> 01:14:47,447
- It's okay.
- Get away.

993
01:14:48,406 --> 01:14:49,532
- Help!
- Hey, look.

994
01:14:51,075 --> 01:14:52,952
Just a normal guy, all right?

995
01:14:54,662 --> 01:14:55,538
Wanna hold this?

996
01:14:57,248 --> 01:14:58,041
Hold my mask.

997
01:14:58,625 --> 01:14:59,584
All right.

998
01:15:01,127 --> 01:15:02,587
What's your name?

999
01:15:02,754 --> 01:15:03,546
Jack?

1000
01:15:04,464 --> 01:15:06,132
- Yes.
- Let's get you out of here.

1001
01:15:07,509 --> 01:15:09,260
Okay, stay very still.

1002
01:15:09,427 --> 01:15:10,261
All right.

1003
01:15:10,428 --> 01:15:11,679
Okay, I got you.

1004
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:16,768
Okay, look.

1005
01:15:16,935 --> 01:15:18,561
I'll undo the belt. You hold on...

1006
01:15:18,728 --> 01:15:20,772
...to that seat in front of you.
On three?

1007
01:15:21,022 --> 01:15:23,691
- All right.
- Okay, one, two, three.

1008
01:15:25,818 --> 01:15:27,987
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

1009
01:15:28,154 --> 01:15:29,864
All right, okay.

1010
01:15:43,461 --> 01:15:44,838
Jack, climb now.

1011
01:15:45,004 --> 01:15:46,631
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1012
01:15:52,011 --> 01:15:54,013
Put it on, the mask.

1013
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:55,598
It's gonna make you strong.

1014
01:15:56,182 --> 01:15:57,517
Jack, trust me.

1015
01:15:57,684 --> 01:15:58,643
Put it on.

1016
01:15:59,435 --> 01:16:02,063
There you go. That's it.
That's it, buddy.

1017
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:03,356
Okay, now, climb.

1018
01:16:03,523 --> 01:16:04,524
Come on, Jack.

1019
01:16:08,278 --> 01:16:08,945
Do me a favour.

1020
01:16:09,112 --> 01:16:10,613
A little faster, okay, bud?

1021
01:16:10,864 --> 01:16:13,199
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

1022
01:16:13,366 --> 01:16:14,450
That's it. Keep coming.

1023
01:16:14,617 --> 01:16:16,035
Keep it coming.

1024
01:16:16,202 --> 01:16:17,245
Keep coming.

1025
01:16:18,162 --> 01:16:19,497
No!

1026
01:16:34,137 --> 01:16:35,847
Jack. Oh, God.

1027
01:16:36,014 --> 01:16:37,515
Thank God.

1028
01:16:39,225 --> 01:16:40,560
You okay?

1029
01:16:43,605 --> 01:16:45,064
My son. My son.

1030
01:16:45,899 --> 01:16:47,025
Oh, my son.

1031
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:48,943
My son.

1032
01:16:53,406 --> 01:16:54,490
Who are you?

1033
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:58,411
Spider-Man.

1034
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:47,460
Beautiful.

1035
01:17:55,635 --> 01:17:56,678
Settle down, guys.

1036
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:59,305
Settle down, boys. Settle down.

1037
01:17:59,472 --> 01:18:01,641
- Come on.
- Listen. At approximately...

1038
01:18:01,808 --> 01:18:05,270
...9 p.m. last night, an incident
took place on the Williamsburg Bridge.

1039
01:18:05,812 --> 01:18:07,647
<i>Much of what occurred
is speculation...</i>

1040
01:18:07,814 --> 01:18:10,608
<i>...at this point.
However, several eyewitnesses...</i>

1041
01:18:10,775 --> 01:18:14,195
<i>...to the crime, as well as
our own preliminary findings, have...</i>

1042
01:18:14,362 --> 01:18:15,488
<i>...positively placed...</i>

1043
01:18:15,655 --> 01:18:17,323
<i>...one individual at the scene.</i>

1044
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:18,950
<i>Which is why, this morning...</i>

1045
01:18:19,117 --> 01:18:20,535
<i>...I am issuing a warrant...</i>

1046
01:18:20,702 --> 01:18:24,038
<i>...for the masked vigilante
known as Spider-Man.</i>

1047
01:18:29,961 --> 01:18:33,673
<i>And lastly, city council members met
with homeowners and airport officials...</i>

1048
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,508
<i>...in the first of four meetings...</i>

1049
01:18:42,807 --> 01:18:44,184
It's so beautiful.

1050
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:46,186
Knows how to bite though.

1051
01:18:46,352 --> 01:18:48,104
Who else knows about this?

1052
01:18:48,271 --> 01:18:49,147
Just you.

1053
01:18:49,314 --> 01:18:50,565
Really?

1054
01:18:53,026 --> 01:18:54,944
Hey, you don't...

1055
01:18:55,695 --> 01:18:58,281
You don't believe what the police
are saying, do you?

1056
01:18:59,157 --> 01:19:00,658
Of course not.

1057
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:04,037
Does it scare you?

1058
01:19:04,204 --> 01:19:06,039
What you can do?

1059
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:09,876
No.

1060
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,086
No.

1061
01:19:13,046 --> 01:19:15,173
What did that thing
on the bridge look like?

1062
01:19:15,715 --> 01:19:18,176
It was real big.
Too big to be human.

1063
01:19:18,551 --> 01:19:20,094
You gotta lay low.

1064
01:19:20,887 --> 01:19:22,263
No, can't do that.

1065
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:24,015
You've got to.

1066
01:19:24,849 --> 01:19:26,351
I mean, why...?

1067
01:19:26,643 --> 01:19:29,145
Because of last night.

1068
01:19:29,312 --> 01:19:31,314
Those people on the bridge.

1069
01:19:31,481 --> 01:19:35,485
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

1070
01:19:37,111 --> 01:19:37,820
So...

1071
01:19:37,987 --> 01:19:39,656
...I gotta go after it.

1072
01:19:41,157 --> 01:19:42,200
That's not your job.

1073
01:19:43,618 --> 01:19:45,203
Maybe it is.

1074
01:19:50,124 --> 01:19:51,668
I really liked kissing you.

1075
01:19:54,295 --> 01:19:55,797
You're an amazing kisser.

1076
01:19:58,591 --> 01:19:59,759
Well, you know, it was--

1077
01:19:59,926 --> 01:20:01,928
It was good for me too.

1078
01:20:04,597 --> 01:20:06,224
Yeah?

1079
01:20:15,608 --> 01:20:16,776
Who did that?

1080
01:20:38,506 --> 01:20:39,507
Hello!

1081
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,352
It's not nice to snoop.

1082
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:56,149
I gave everyone the week off.

1083
01:20:58,359 --> 01:20:59,068
Yeah.

1084
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,654
Shouldn't you be at school?

1085
01:21:03,406 --> 01:21:05,450
No, I got a free track.

1086
01:21:05,617 --> 01:21:07,619
I wanted to ask you a question.

1087
01:21:08,328 --> 01:21:09,370
How would a predator...

1088
01:21:09,537 --> 01:21:10,830
...track a reptile?

1089
01:21:10,955 --> 01:21:13,833
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top...

1090
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,251
...of their food chain.

1091
01:21:15,418 --> 01:21:16,920
Kings of their domain.

1092
01:21:17,086 --> 01:21:18,588
They gotta have vulnerabilities.

1093
01:21:18,755 --> 01:21:21,299
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

1094
01:21:24,844 --> 01:21:26,137
Just asking a question.

1095
01:21:26,304 --> 01:21:29,140
I got school stuff.

1096
01:21:29,307 --> 01:21:31,309
Biology profiles to do.

1097
01:21:31,726 --> 01:21:33,978
So because of the cold blood...

1098
01:21:34,145 --> 01:21:36,064
...would they react to changes
in temperatures?

1099
01:21:36,231 --> 01:21:37,607
You'd have to catch one first.

1100
01:21:38,525 --> 01:21:41,819
Did you know there's a rumour
of a new species in New York?

1101
01:21:41,986 --> 01:21:43,488
Beautiful and quite large.

1102
01:21:44,656 --> 01:21:46,616
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

1103
01:21:46,783 --> 01:21:48,785
No, it's not yet classified.

1104
01:21:51,746 --> 01:21:53,748
But it can be aggressive...

1105
01:21:54,666 --> 01:21:55,583
...if threatened.

1106
01:22:03,341 --> 01:22:04,592
Doc, you all right?

1107
01:22:04,759 --> 01:22:07,387
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

1108
01:22:07,554 --> 01:22:09,097
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1109
01:22:09,264 --> 01:22:12,016
Afraid I have to ask you to leave.
I have a new project...

1110
01:22:12,183 --> 01:22:14,602
...I'm working on.
I need to be alone.

1111
01:22:15,228 --> 01:22:17,522
Good. Good, good.

1112
01:22:18,064 --> 01:22:19,899
Good.

1113
01:22:20,483 --> 01:22:23,403
Don't worry, Mr. Parker.
I'll be back.

1114
01:22:24,404 --> 01:22:26,531
Wonderful things are coming.

1115
01:22:27,782 --> 01:22:29,576
Wonderful things.

1116
01:22:44,132 --> 01:22:45,425
Fred?

1117
01:22:50,221 --> 01:22:52,432
Mr. Mayor,
if there was a giant dinosaur...

1118
01:22:52,599 --> 01:22:55,101
...running around
you would be the first to know.

1119
01:22:55,226 --> 01:22:57,812
So tell your son
he can rest easy, all right?

1120
01:22:57,979 --> 01:23:00,023
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

1121
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:02,400
Okay. Bye-bye-

1122
01:23:02,525 --> 01:23:04,444
Mr. Parker, why are you...

1123
01:23:04,569 --> 01:23:06,446
...not in school?
- Got a free track.

1124
01:23:06,613 --> 01:23:07,864
Okay, well, I do not.

1125
01:23:08,031 --> 01:23:09,282
So make your point quickly.

1126
01:23:09,449 --> 01:23:11,826
Fine, there may not be a dinosaur
running around.

1127
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:14,287
There is something more dangerous,
and I know who.

1128
01:23:14,454 --> 01:23:16,039
- You know who?
- Dr. Curtis Connors.

1129
01:23:16,206 --> 01:23:17,582
- He's a biochemist.
- Of Oscorp?

1130
01:23:17,749 --> 01:23:19,250
- That's right.
- Dr. Connors...

1131
01:23:19,417 --> 01:23:21,419
...who's my daughter's mentor.
Is that who?

1132
01:23:21,586 --> 01:23:22,795
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1133
01:23:22,962 --> 01:23:26,257
Recently, Dr. Connors gave Gwen
a college recommendation.

1134
01:23:26,424 --> 01:23:28,468
It was beautiful.
When I read it, I cried.

1135
01:23:28,593 --> 01:23:30,803
You would have me believe
that he...

1136
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:33,181
...is running around dressed up
like a dinosaur?

1137
01:23:33,348 --> 01:23:37,018
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur.
He has transformed himself into a lizard.

1138
01:23:40,271 --> 01:23:41,814
Let me ask you a question.

1139
01:23:41,981 --> 01:23:45,109
Do I look like the mayor
of Tokyo to you?

1140
01:23:45,235 --> 01:23:47,737
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

1141
01:23:47,904 --> 01:23:50,949
This man has worked for his whole life
on cross-species genetics.

1142
01:23:51,115 --> 01:23:54,661
He lost an arm, he tried to grow it back,
but the equation was imbalanced.

1143
01:23:54,827 --> 01:23:57,288
He has turned into a lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

1144
01:23:57,455 --> 01:24:01,167
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

1145
01:24:01,334 --> 01:24:03,795
Okay. All right, I get it.

1146
01:24:04,671 --> 01:24:05,713
Here's what we'll do.

1147
01:24:06,172 --> 01:24:08,967
You'll go back to hanging out
with the citizens of Tokyo.

1148
01:24:09,133 --> 01:24:11,344
I'm gonna go back
to protecting the citizens...

1149
01:24:11,511 --> 01:24:13,555
...of this fine, fair city of ours.

1150
01:24:13,721 --> 01:24:15,974
Sergeant Butler,
please escort Mr. Parker...

1151
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:19,102
...back to school.
- Captain Stacy, I'm not messing around.

1152
01:24:19,269 --> 01:24:22,313
Just bring him in. Just call him in.
You have to call him in.

1153
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,107
He is a danger to everybody.

1154
01:24:24,274 --> 01:24:26,526
- Just, please, listen to me.
- Let's go.

1155
01:24:30,864 --> 01:24:32,198
Jimmy.

1156
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:36,286
Get me everything we have
on Dr. Curtis Connors.

1157
01:24:36,411 --> 01:24:38,997
- Okay? Right away.
- Yeah.

1158
01:24:39,038 --> 01:24:39,455

1159
01:25:04,397 --> 01:25:06,357
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors.

1160
01:25:06,524 --> 01:25:08,067
Current temperature: 89.7.

1161
01:25:08,234 --> 01:25:09,694
Steady for 48 hours.

1162
01:25:09,861 --> 01:25:12,363
Blood panels reveal
lymphocyte and monocyte readings...

1163
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:14,199
...consistent with subject's past.

1164
01:25:19,954 --> 01:25:21,623
Clotting rate vastly improved.

1165
01:25:21,789 --> 01:25:23,291
Marked enhancement...

1166
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:24,792
...in muscle response...

1167
01:25:24,959 --> 01:25:26,336
...strength and elasticity.

1168
01:25:34,177 --> 01:25:36,262
Eyesight similarly improved.

1169
01:25:36,429 --> 01:25:38,932
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

1170
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:46,189
This is no longer about curing ills.

1171
01:25:46,731 --> 01:25:48,107
This is about...

1172
01:25:48,233 --> 01:25:49,359
...finding perfection.

1173
01:25:58,618 --> 01:26:00,703
In attempt to redress
regenerative relapse...

1174
01:26:00,828 --> 01:26:04,624
...dosage has been increased
to 200 milligrams.

1175
01:27:39,427 --> 01:27:41,179
You stopped me once.

1176
01:27:42,013 --> 01:27:44,390
You won't stop me again.

1177
01:27:46,392 --> 01:27:49,395
I'm getting stronger every day!

1178
01:28:28,142 --> 01:28:29,686
Oh, that sucked.

1179
01:28:41,114 --> 01:28:42,782
Peter Parker.

1180
01:29:00,466 --> 01:29:02,010
Come in.

1181
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:05,805
You should maybe...

1182
01:29:05,972 --> 01:29:07,807
...consider coming in
through the lobby.

1183
01:29:09,434 --> 01:29:12,478
Also, my father is under
the impression...

1184
01:29:12,604 --> 01:29:15,481
...that you require psychiatric attention.
- Oh, really?

1185
01:29:15,732 --> 01:29:17,317
Peter.

1186
01:29:17,817 --> 01:29:18,860
What happened?

1187
01:29:18,985 --> 01:29:20,361
You should see the other guy.

1188
01:29:22,197 --> 01:29:26,618
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

1189
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,785
Hey, Gwen, honey.

1190
01:29:27,952 --> 01:29:28,870
Do you want cocoa?

1191
01:29:29,037 --> 01:29:30,163
Howard's making some.

1192
01:29:34,751 --> 01:29:36,169
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.

1193
01:29:36,336 --> 01:29:38,004
Honestly, I'm 17 years old.

1194
01:29:38,171 --> 01:29:39,005
Okay.

1195
01:29:39,172 --> 01:29:43,218
I remembered somebody saying her
fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.

1196
01:29:43,384 --> 01:29:44,844
Well, that's impractical.

1197
01:29:44,969 --> 01:29:46,429
And fattening.

1198
01:29:49,682 --> 01:29:50,767
Chocolate house.

1199
01:29:53,645 --> 01:29:55,438
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's good.

1200
01:29:55,605 --> 01:29:58,399
I can't have cocoa right now
because I'm work--

1201
01:29:58,525 --> 01:30:01,653
I'm doing this...

1202
01:30:01,819 --> 01:30:03,446
I have cramps.

1203
01:30:04,322 --> 01:30:06,366
I feel kind of pukey and just sort of...

1204
01:30:06,533 --> 01:30:08,826
- Like, emotional. I keep crying.
- It's okay. Good.

1205
01:30:08,952 --> 01:30:10,703
- Good.
- It's brutal.

1206
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:12,914
You don't want to know.

1207
01:30:13,081 --> 01:30:14,249
- It's, like, bad.
- Got it.

1208
01:30:14,415 --> 01:30:16,376
- Thanks, Daddy.
- All right.

1209
01:30:41,484 --> 01:30:43,903
Easy, Bug BOY

1210
01:30:44,654 --> 01:30:46,072
What'd you call me?

1211
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,996
I'm going to be all right.

1212
01:30:53,162 --> 01:30:55,874
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

1213
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:59,752
I know what this is.

1214
01:30:59,919 --> 01:31:01,254
What is it?

1215
01:31:02,172 --> 01:31:05,341
Every day, for as long
as I can remember, my father...

1216
01:31:05,508 --> 01:31:06,968
...has left every morning...

1217
01:31:07,135 --> 01:31:09,804
...and he's put a badge on his chest...

1218
01:31:09,971 --> 01:31:12,265
...and strapped a gun to his hip.

1219
01:31:14,934 --> 01:31:17,312
And every day,
for as long as I can remember...

1220
01:31:17,478 --> 01:31:19,939
...I haven't known if he was
gonna make it home.

1221
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:31,326
<i>L</i> 901 you

1222
01:31:32,577 --> 01:31:33,745
Okay?

1223
01:31:36,456 --> 01:31:37,457
Okay?

1224
01:31:39,042 --> 01:31:41,127
I gotta stop him, though.

1225
01:31:41,794 --> 01:31:44,714
I have to, because I created him.

1226
01:31:48,009 --> 01:31:49,469
What do you mean?

1227
01:31:50,887 --> 01:31:52,972
I gave him an equation...

1228
01:31:55,517 --> 01:31:57,644
...that made all of this possible.

1229
01:32:05,276 --> 01:32:08,154
Something my father
had been working on, you know.

1230
01:32:08,321 --> 01:32:11,324
Secretly. Now I realise
why he kept it a secret.

1231
01:32:14,118 --> 01:32:16,579
Point is, this is my responsibility.

1232
01:32:19,916 --> 01:32:22,085
I have to fix it.

1233
01:32:25,171 --> 01:32:26,840
Peter.

1234
01:32:27,882 --> 01:32:29,592
Hey.

1235
01:32:32,887 --> 01:32:35,014
Let's get out of here.

1236
01:32:35,181 --> 01:32:36,975
Let's just get out of here.

1237
01:32:37,141 --> 01:32:38,852
Just for a minute. Can we?

1238
01:32:39,561 --> 01:32:41,521
- No. No.
- Yeah. Yes.

1239
01:32:41,688 --> 01:32:42,856
- Yes.
- No.

1240
01:32:43,022 --> 01:32:44,190
Yes.

1241
01:32:44,357 --> 01:32:46,860
If my parents see me leaving,
I'm dead.

1242
01:32:51,447 --> 01:32:53,533
Your parents aren't
gonna see you leaving.

<i>...humanity on an evolutionary scale.</i>

1263
01:35:04,539 --> 01:35:06,541
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

1264
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:25,101
All these souls...

1265
01:35:25,268 --> 01:35:26,519
...lost and alone.

1266
01:35:26,686 --> 01:35:27,562
I can save them.

1267
01:35:27,729 --> 01:35:29,355
I can cure them.

1268
01:35:29,522 --> 01:35:31,107
There's no need to stop me...

1269
01:35:31,274 --> 01:35:32,192
...Peter.

1270
01:35:41,743 --> 01:35:43,828
You're not thinking straight, doc.

1271
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:49,167
Stop this. This isn't you.

1272
01:35:54,339 --> 01:35:55,298
Let's talk this out.

1273
01:35:56,424 --> 01:35:57,175
Doc!

1274
01:36:03,264 --> 01:36:04,307
Oh, boy.

1275
01:36:09,896 --> 01:36:10,939
You don't want to talk?

1276
01:36:11,773 --> 01:36:13,316
There you go.

1277
01:36:16,945 --> 01:36:18,154
Don't...

1278
01:36:18,947 --> 01:36:20,532

...hurt you!

1281
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:32,377
That is disgusting.

01:36:42,428 --> 01:36:43,805
Gwen.

1283
01:37:07,745 --> 01:37:09,956
- I'm gonna throw you out the window.
- What?

1284
01:37:23,178 --> 01:37:24,220
Somebody's been...

1285
01:37:24,387 --> 01:37:26,055
...a bad lizard.

1286
01:38:12,936 --> 01:38:15,021
This is Lieutenant Williams
from the New York City...

1287
01:38:15,188 --> 01:38:18,650
...Police Department.
We've got this building surrounded.

1288

Alpha, let's move ahead. Go!

1289
01:38:41,464 --> 01:38:42,757
- Hey.
- Where are you?

1290
01:38:42,924 --> 01:38:43,842
I'm fine. I'm okay.

1291
01:38:44,008 --> 01:38:47,387
I'm in the sewer, tracking him. I gotta
stop him before anyone gets hurt.

1292
01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:48,680
But we need an antidote.

1293

Okay, I need you to go to Oscorp.

1299
01:39:34,142 --> 01:39:37,770

01:39:54,370 --> 01:39:56,664
<i>Faster. Stronger.</i>

1309
01:39:56,831 --> 01:39:58,249
<i>Smarter.</i>

1310
01:39:58,416 --> 01:40:01,252
<i>This is my gift to you.</i>

1311
01:40:09,761 --> 01:40:11,429
Oscorp.

1312
01:40:13,681 --> 01:40:14,807
- Captain Stacy!
- What?

1313
01:40:14,974 --> 01:40:17,435
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed...

1314
01:40:17,602 --> 01:40:19,812
...toward Canal Street.
- What about Spider-Man?

1315
01:40:19,979 --> 01:40:21,189
Inside the high school.

1316
01:40:21,356 --> 01:40:23,274
I want that Spider-Man off the street.

1317
01:42:09,881 --> 01:42:12,759
<i>The lizard creature
has released a biological agent.</i>

1318
01:42:12,926 --> 01:42:14,719
<i>All efforts to stop him have failed...</i>

1319
01:42:14,886 --> 01:42:18,097
<i>...and he is now proceeding
north on 7th Avenue. Over.</i>

1320
01:42:22,101 --> 01:42:22,977
- Hi.
- Where are you?

1321
01:42:23,144 --> 01:42:24,437
<i>Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp.</i>

1322
01:42:24,604 --> 01:42:26,356
You have to get out of there now.

1323
01:42:26,523 --> 01:42:28,900
- The antidote is cooking.
- No, no, no.

1324
01:42:29,067 --> 01:42:31,528
<i>Connors is on the way.
He's coming to you right now.</i>

1325
01:42:31,694 --> 01:42:34,239
He needs the device.
He's gonna infect the whole city!

1326
01:42:34,405 --> 01:42:35,573
Eight minutes left.

1327
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:38,284
<i>You're gonna wait eight minutes
after what I told you?</i>

1328
01:42:38,451 --> 01:42:39,786
You leave right now.

1329
01:42:39,953 --> 01:42:40,995
<i>That is an order, okay?</i>

1330
01:42:41,162 --> 01:42:42,247
I'll get everybody out.

1331
01:42:42,413 --> 01:42:43,915
<i>Did you hear wh--?</i>

1332
01:42:44,082 --> 01:42:47,126
Gwen! Gwen! You Mother Hubbard.
Are you serious?

1333
01:43:03,643 --> 01:43:04,811
He's heading south.

1334
01:43:15,572 --> 01:43:17,574
Stand down now, or we will open fire.

1335
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:19,492
You are surrounded. There is...

1336
01:43:19,659 --> 01:43:20,994
...l"IO BSCBPB

1337
01:43:21,452 --> 01:43:22,871
Go, go!

1338
01:44:24,807 --> 01:44:26,184
Clear!

1339
01:44:26,351 --> 01:44:27,477
Clear up top!

1340
01:44:29,312 --> 01:44:30,563
Clear, sir!

1341
01:44:30,730 --> 01:44:31,898
All clear here, sir!

1342
01:44:57,382 --> 01:44:58,925
Freeze!

1343
01:44:59,592 --> 01:45:00,760
Down on the ground.

1344
01:45:00,927 --> 01:45:02,387
Your hands behind your head.

1345
01:45:02,554 --> 01:45:04,180
Now!

1346
01:45:07,559 --> 01:45:09,018
Parker.

1347
01:45:10,895 --> 01:45:11,896
It's headed to Oscorp!

1348
01:45:12,063 --> 01:45:14,440
And your daughter's there right now.

1349
01:45:27,203 --> 01:45:28,496
You gotta let me go.

1350
01:45:43,094 --> 01:45:43,845
Hold your fire!

1351
01:45:50,935 --> 01:45:53,438
Well, Paul, if I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

1352
01:45:53,605 --> 01:45:56,024
I won't venture to say
what it is crawling up...

1353
01:45:56,191 --> 01:45:58,109
...the north side
of the Oscorp Tower...

1354
01:45:58,276 --> 01:46:01,529
...but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

1355

<i>Time remaining: one minute.</i>

<i>We're getting the latest details.
This is just coming in.</i>

1359
01:47:52,432 --> 01:47:54,100
<i>The New York Police Department...</i>

1360
01:47:54,267 --> 01:47:56,269
<i>...has called for
a city-wide evacuation...</i>

<i>...everything south of 54th Street.</i>

1362

<i>If you are south of 54th Street...</i>

1363
01:48:01,191 --> 01:48:03,651
<i>...you have to move out
of the area immediately.</i>

1364
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:15,705
<i>Spider-Man appears
to be heading towards Oscorp.</i>

1365
01:48:15,872 --> 01:48:16,915
<i>He looks injured...</i>

1366
01:48:17,081 --> 01:48:19,751
<i>...and it's really not clear
if he's gonna make it.</i>

1367
01:48:19,918 --> 01:48:21,002
<i>That's the guy who...</i>

1368
01:48:21,169 --> 01:48:22,545
...saved my boy on the bridge.

1369
01:48:22,712 --> 01:48:24,088
Troy, they're clearing us out.

1370
01:48:24,255 --> 01:48:26,674
Something bad's
going down in Midtown.

1371
01:48:26,841 --> 01:48:29,427
Still friends with Matthews,
that crane operator on 6th?

1372
01:48:29,594 --> 01:48:31,513
- Yeah.
- Get him on the phone for me.

1373
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:33,765
The cops are evacuating everybody.

1374
01:48:33,932 --> 01:48:36,142
Get him on the phone for me.

1375
01:48:53,743 --> 01:48:56,371
Hey, Charlie, get me Enrique:
on 54th Street!

1376
01:48:56,538 --> 01:48:58,623
- You got it.
- Angelo, get your mug over here.

1377
01:48:58,790 --> 01:49:01,125
Wolski! You're getting some overtime!

1378
01:49:02,502 --> 01:49:04,462
<i>All tower cranes on 6th...</i>

1379
01:49:04,629 --> 01:49:08,341
swing your jib arms over the avenue
Boom angles at 90 degrees.

1380

<i>Spider-Man needs those big boys

<i>Let's give him a clear approach. Over.</i>

1382
01:49:46,796 --> 01:49:48,464
Come on, Parker.

1383
01:51:44,205 --> 01:51:44,914
Hey.

1384
01:51:45,206 --> 01:51:46,291
Dad!

1385
01:51:46,457 --> 01:51:48,626
- I have to get this to Spider-Man.
- Get in.

1386
01:51:48,793 --> 01:51:50,628
- It can stop the Lizard.
- Get in the car.

1387
01:51:50,795 --> 01:51:53,673
- You don't understand!
- Yes, I do.

1388
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:56,092
Your boyfriend
is a man of many masks.

1389
01:51:56,259 --> 01:51:57,427
I get it.

1390
01:51:57,594 --> 01:51:58,678

...no uncle.

1398

All alone.

1399
01:54:01,968 --> 01:54:02,969
He's not alone.

Look at me. Stay with me.

- Help's on the way, okay?
- You need to...

1429
01:57:30,260 --> 01:57:33,763
You need to be gone

You're gonna make enemies.

So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

1440
01:58:08,882 --> 01:58:12,677
Leave Gwen out of it.

...rifles and they made speeches.

1465
02:02:14,752 --> 02:02:16,713
Two of my teachers showed up.

1466
02:02:18,131 --> 02:02:19,507

Everyone was there but you.

1468
02:02:41,654 --> 02:02:43,781
Can't do this. Can't do this.

1469
02:02:46,034 --> 02:02:48,077
I'm sorry. I can't...

1470
02:02:48,244 --> 02:02:49,662
What are you saying?

1471
02:02:49,829 --> 02:02:51,664
I can't see you any more.

1472
02:02:53,625 --> 02:02:55,084
I can't.

1473
02:03:20,693 --> 02:03:22,695
He made you promise, didn't he?

1474
02:03:26,699 --> 02:03:30,578
To stay away from me, so I'd be safe.

1475
02:03:57,063 --> 02:03:57,897
What a pretty...

1476
02:03:58,064 --> 02:03:58,940
...girl.

1477
02:03:59,107 --> 02:04:00,275
Yeah.

1478
02:04:00,441 --> 02:04:02,235
That's what Uncle Ben said.

1479
02:04:03,278 --> 02:04:04,946
Did you ask her out?

1480
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:10,034
Why?

1481
02:04:11,119 --> 02:04:12,579
Can't.

1482
02:04:13,872 --> 02:04:15,248
Why?

1483
02:04:17,834 --> 02:04:19,544
I'm just no good for her.

1484
02:04:22,714 --> 02:04:26,176
Peter Parker, if there's
one thing you are, it's good.

1485
02:04:27,218 --> 02:04:28,386
Anyone has a problem...

1486
02:04:28,553 --> 02:04:30,263
...with that can talk to me.

1487
02:04:47,989 --> 02:04:51,034
<i>Peter, I know things have been...</i>

1488
02:04:51,201 --> 02:04:52,410
<i>...difficult lately...</i>

1489
02:04:52,577 --> 02:04:54,662
<i>...and I'm sorry about that.</i>

1490
02:04:55,079 --> 02:04:58,041
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

1491
02:04:58,208 --> 02:05:00,793
<i>Ever since you were a little boy...</i>

1492
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:05,381
<i>...you've been living with
so many unresolved things.</i>

1493
02:05:06,591 --> 02:05:08,885
<i>Well, take it from an old man:</i>

1494
02:05:09,469 --> 02:05:12,555
<i>Those things send us
down a road.</i>

1495
02:05:12,722 --> 02:05:13,806
<i>They make us...</i>

1496
02:05:13,973 --> 02:05:15,058
<i>...who we are.</i>

1497
02:05:15,308 --> 02:05:20,563
<i>And if anyone's destined for greatness,
it's you, son.</i>

1498
02:05:21,147 --> 02:05:23,566
<i>You owe the world your gifts.</i>

1499
02:05:24,150 --> 02:05:27,028
<i>You just have to figure out
how to use them.</i>

1500
02:05:27,570 --> 02:05:30,907
<i>And know that wherever
they take you...</i>

1501
02:05:31,074 --> 02:05:33,368
<i>...we'll always be here.</i>

1502
02:05:34,202 --> 02:05:36,788
<i>So come on home, Peter.</i>

1503
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:39,499
<i>You're my hero.</i>

1504
02:05:39,666 --> 02:05:41,167
<i>And I love you.</i>

1505
02:05:49,592 --> 02:05:51,302
- What's up, Parker?
- What's up?

1506
02:05:51,469 --> 02:05:52,929
Hey. How's it going?

1507
02:05:53,888 --> 02:05:55,265
You coming along, man?

1508
02:05:56,850 --> 02:05:57,684
Cool shirt.

1509
02:05:59,561 --> 02:06:00,687
Yeah.

1510
02:06:00,854 --> 02:06:02,355
Dude's crazy.

1511
02:06:02,522 --> 02:06:03,898
But chicks dig him.

1512
02:06:06,693 --> 02:06:09,404
Come on, guys, you heard the bell.
Get to class.

1513
02:06:18,872 --> 02:06:21,749
<i>I had a professor once
who liked to tell his students...</i>

1514
02:06:21,916 --> 02:06:25,170
...that there were only 10 different plots
in all of fiction.

1515
02:06:26,129 --> 02:06:28,214
Well, I'm here to tell you
he was wrong.

1516
02:06:28,381 --> 02:06:29,799
There is only one:

1517
02:06:30,717 --> 02:06:32,218
"Who am I"?

1518
02:06:32,927 --> 02:06:34,846
Mr. Parker.

1519
02:06:35,013 --> 02:06:36,014
Tardy again.

1520
02:06:37,974 --> 02:06:39,809
At least we can always count on you.

1521
02:06:39,976 --> 02:06:42,729
Sorry, Miss Ritter,
won't happen again, I promise.

1522
02:06:42,896 --> 02:06:44,981
Don't make promises you can't keep.

1523
02:06:47,233 --> 02:06:49,402
Yeah, but those are the best kind.

1524
02:06:49,569 --> 02:06:51,404
Okay, class, open your books.

1525
02:06:51,571 --> 02:06:53,573
Let's begin on page one.

1526
02:09:48,831 --> 02:09:51,417
Hello, doctor.

1527
02:09:51,584 --> 02:09:52,919
Did you tell the boy?

1528
02:09:53,086 --> 02:09:54,128
Tell him what?

1529
02:09:54,295 --> 02:09:58,049
Did you tell the boy
the truth about his father?

1530
02:09:59,717 --> 02:10:00,593
No.

1531
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:02,345
Well, that's very good.

1532
02:10:02,679 --> 02:10:03,763
So we'll let him be...

1533
02:10:03,930 --> 02:10:04,889
...for now.

1534
02:10:05,932 --> 02:10:08,017
You should leave him alone!
