678

- CARLISLE: I'm not sure.

U ltrasounds and needles
won't penetrate the embryonic sac.

I can't see it, either.

And I can't see Bella's future anymore.

CARLISLE: We've been researching legends,
but there isn't much to go on .

And fast-growing .

707
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:28,488
Why haven't you done anything?
Take it out of her!

708
01:03:29,113 --> 01:03:30,907
This is none of your business, dog .

710

All this fighting isn't good for Bella.

The fetus isn't good for Bella.

712

Say the word , Alice. "Baby."
It's just a little baby.

713
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:43,127
Carlisle, you've gotta do something .

714
01:03:43,294 --> 01:03:44,086
No.

715
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,924
It's not his decision . It's not any of yours.

716
01:03:48,007 --> 01:03:49,800
Jacob, I need to talk to you .

717

I always knew you'd destroy her.

718

She thinks Carlisle can turn her
at the last minute,

You have a connection with her
that I'll never understand .

726
01:04:41,435 --> 01:04:44,230
Maybe you could talk to her,
change her mind .

To kill me.

732
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:18,472
Rose, I'm fine, really.

733
01:05:38,618 --> 01:05:41,287
- So, Edward sent you in here to talk to me?
- Sort of.

why he thinks you'd listen to me.

- And when you die,

Of me loving you , you loving him .
