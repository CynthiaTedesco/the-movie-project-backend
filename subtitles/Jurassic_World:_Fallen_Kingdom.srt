I'm kind of exposed out here.</font>

73
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:41,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we amassed landmark technological power</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we've consistently proven ourselves
incapable of handling that power.</font>

And now we've got genetic power,</font>

for that to spread around the globe</font>

136
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:56,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you mind holding for a second?</font>

137
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, of course I'll hold.</font>

138
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:28,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Dearing, you're early.</font>

139
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to step in?</font>

140
00:12:30,242 --> 00:12:31,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

141
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:35,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will inform Mr. Mills that you've arrived.</font>

142
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:01,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John Alfred Hammond,
the father of Jurassic Park.</font>

143
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:03,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But of course you knew that.</font>

144
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:07,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Claire. I'm Eli Mills.
I work for Ben Lockwood.</font>

145
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We actually met once, 7, 8 years ago,</font>

146
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:11,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and you don't remember.
- Of course I remember.</font>

147
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:13,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Haven't you run his foundation since...
- Since college, yeah.</font>

148
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:15,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You remember?
- Yes.</font>

149
00:13:15,454 --> 00:13:19,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Cool. He wanted someone young
and idealistic to spend his fortune</font>

150
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:22,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I used to be both.</font>

151
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

152
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:28,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me give you a bit of history.</font>

153
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:30,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is where it all began.</font>

154
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:33,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before the island,
Sorna, Jurassic Park, all of it.</font>

155
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:36,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hammond and Lockwood built
a custom lab in the sub-basement,</font>

156
00:13:37,143 --> 00:13:40,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">extracted the first DNA from
amber right beneath our feet.</font>

157
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:42,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my goodness.</font>

158
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What they did here was a miracle.</font>

159
00:13:45,943 --> 00:13:47,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still believe that.</font>

160
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:48,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So do I, Claire.</font>

161
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:50,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So do I.</font>

162
00:13:50,406 --> 00:13:53,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I still believe it matters
what happens to those animals.</font>

163
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:58,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is something Mr. Lockwood
would very much like you to do, Claire.</font>

164
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:00,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can call it a favor for an old friend.</font>

165
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a piece of land.</font>

166
00:14:04,462 --> 00:14:08,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A sanctuary protected by natural
barriers, fully self-sustaining.</font>

167
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:12,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A new home where the dinosaurs
will be secure and free.</font>

168
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:14,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna get them out?</font>

169
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:15,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna save them?</font>

170
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Ms. Dearing.</font>

171
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:19,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to save us.</font>

172
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:22,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could both use a touch
of redemption, couldn't we?</font>

173
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:25,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lovely to see you again.</font>

174
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you, Mr. Lockwood.</font>

175
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:30,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was all John Hammond's dream.</font>

176
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:33,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To let these creatures live in peace.</font>

177
00:14:33,908 --> 00:14:37,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we have created sanctuary.</font>

178
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:39,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No fences. No cages.</font>

179
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No tourists.</font>

180
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:43,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just as Mother Nature intended.</font>

181
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:45,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John said it best.</font>

182
00:14:46,963 --> 00:14:49,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"These creatures don't need our protection.</font>

183
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:52,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"They need our absence."</font>

184
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:58,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we were young,
we both shared this passion,</font>

185
00:14:58,641 --> 00:14:59,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John and I.</font>

186
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What fools we were,</font>

187
00:15:04,313 --> 00:15:07,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">trying to run before we'd learned to walk.</font>

188
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As all young men do, I suppose.</font>

189
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:13,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we learned.</font>

190
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:18,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately, in the end, it drove us apart.</font>

191
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:24,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life teaches us some very hard lessons,</font>

192
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:26,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">doesn't it, Claire?</font>

193
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:29,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

194
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:31,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir Benjamin.
- Hmm?</font>

195
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:32,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>

196
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:34,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My bloody medicines.</font>

197
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:36,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you excuse me, Claire?</font>

198
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:37,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

199
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:40,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eli here will help you with the details.</font>

200
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will save them.</font>

201
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a gift</font>

202
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:49,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for our children.</font>

203
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:51,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

204
00:15:52,903 --> 00:15:54,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iris?</font>

205
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:01,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does he have children? I thought I saw...
Was there a little girl?</font>

206
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:02,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has a grandchild.</font>

207
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:05,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His daughter died in a car accident.</font>

208
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:06,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's awful.</font>

209
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:09,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know, but they're
very close. Really close.</font>

210
00:16:11,255 --> 00:16:12,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what do you need from me?</font>

211
00:16:13,382 --> 00:16:15,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was a tracking system
in place at your park.</font>

212
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:18,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Radio-frequency ID chips in each dinosaur.</font>

213
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:19,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I remember.
- Right.</font>

214
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if we could access that system,</font>

215
00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:25,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">our ability to locate and capture those
animals safely would increase tenfold.</font>

216
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:28,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need your handprint to access the system,</font>

217
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:30,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but what I really need, Claire,</font>

218
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:32,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is you.</font>

219
00:16:33,277 --> 00:16:37,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Moving endangered species isn't exactly
legal, but it's the right thing to do.</font>

220
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:40,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one knows this park as well
as you do and we need that expertise.</font>

221
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:43,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How many can you save?
- 11 species. For sure.</font>

222
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:47,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, more if we can,
but time is against us.</font>

223
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:51,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid there is one animal in particular</font>

224
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:53,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that poses a real challenge for us.</font>

225
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:56,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Blue.
- I didn't know she had a name,</font>

226
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:58,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but Blue is potentially</font>

227
00:16:58,386 --> 00:17:00,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the second-most intelligent
piece of life on this planet</font>

228
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:03,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she's the last of her kind.
She must be preserved.</font>

229
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:06,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She can pick up your scent a mile off.
You'll never capture her.</font>

230
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:11,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we thought you might know
someone who could help.</font>

231
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you could convince him.</font>

232
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:40,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Time, she is a freight train chugging</font>

233
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:44,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, stalling Time is, too</font>

234
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:48,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When the light at the end of the tunnel</font>

235
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:55,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is growing small behind you</font>

236
00:17:55,151 --> 00:17:56,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Owen.</font>

237
00:17:57,361 --> 00:18:00,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still love you in the morning</font>

238
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:01,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Owen!</font>

239
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:04,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy.</font>

240
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:12,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

241
00:18:13,836 --> 00:18:15,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back for more, huh?</font>

242
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:17,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I buy you a beer?</font>

243
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:20,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you bring them, or do we
gotta, like, go somewhere?</font>

244
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:30,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

245
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:31,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously?</font>

246
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe you think that you left me!</font>

247
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:35,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Replay the conversation
in your head, all right?</font>

248
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:38,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said, "You wanna go
live in your van, like a bum?</font>

249
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:40,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Go ahead, Owen."</font>

250
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:41,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I said, "Okay."</font>

251
00:18:42,114 --> 00:18:43,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, how is that you leaving me?</font>

252
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:45,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I left. I left you.</font>

253
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You left because I told you to.</font>

254
00:18:48,204 --> 00:18:49,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then, I left.</font>

255
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:52,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you didn't wanna live
in a van on the side of the road.</font>

256
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No. No, no, no.
- Remember?</font>

257
00:18:53,918 --> 00:18:56,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you wouldn't let me drive
the damn van for 5 minutes.</font>

258
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:58,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm chivalrous. What can I do?</font>

259
00:18:58,547 --> 00:18:59,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are so stubborn.</font>

260
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:02,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, look at you now.
You're saving the world.</font>

261
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:03,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying, at least.</font>

262
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:05,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't just run away
from everything, Owen.</font>

263
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:06,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you're what...</font>

264
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:08,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dating an accountant now?</font>

265
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:10,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An insurance actuary?</font>

266
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:12,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your skin looks nice.</font>

267
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:16,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dermatologist?</font>

268
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:17,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Owen...</font>

269
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:19,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Does he check you for moles?
- Stop.</font>

270
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:20,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A ventriloquist?</font>

271
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:22,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not why we're here, okay?</font>

272
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:23,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know why we're here.</font>

273
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:26,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lockwood's little flunky called me.</font>

274
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:28,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rescue op.</font>

275
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:31,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Save the dinosaurs from
an island that's about to explode.</font>

276
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:33,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What could go wrong?
- I'm going.</font>

277
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:34,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't.
- I don't have a choice.</font>

278
00:19:35,084 --> 00:19:36,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Of course you have a choice.</font>

279
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:38,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what, I should just build my own cabin,</font>

280
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:42,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">play pool, and drink beer all day
while these dinosaurs go extinct?</font>

281
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:44,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I like pool.</font>

282
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:46,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blue is alive.</font>

283
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:49,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, Claire!</font>

284
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:51,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You raised her, Owen.</font>

285
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:54,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You spent years of your life
working with her.</font>

286
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:56,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're just gonna let her die?</font>

287
00:19:58,733 --> 00:19:59,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, yeah.</font>

288
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, you're a better man
than you think you are.</font>

289
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:10,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should write fortune cookies.</font>

290
00:20:12,413 --> 00:20:13,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forget it...</font>

291
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:16,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a charter flight
leaving tomorrow morning.</font>

292
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:19,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're on the manifest.
I just wanted to let you know.</font>

293
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, chow time, chow time.</font>

294
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:39,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa.</font>

295
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:40,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back up. Back off.</font>

296
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:43,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, hey. Jeez.</font>

297
00:20:43,402 --> 00:20:45,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it easy. Echo.</font>

298
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:48,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez, there's plenty of food.</font>

299
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:51,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, you guys been eating sugar or something?</font>

300
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:52,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're hyper today.</font>

301
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:57,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay. Back up.</font>

302
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Blue.</font>

303
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:02,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa.</font>

304
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:08,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you get that?</font>

305
00:21:18,062 --> 00:21:21,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax. You're more likely to die
riding on a horse than in a plane.</font>

306
00:21:21,774 --> 00:21:23,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm not, because I won't get on a horse.</font>

307
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:24,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My chances are zero.</font>

308
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Planes are the safest way to travel.</font>

309
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You call this a plane?
My cousin has a drone bigger than this.</font>

310
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:40,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Owen!
- Franklin, you wiener, get on the plane.</font>

311
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:42,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't think you were gonna ever show up.</font>

312
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:44,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, um...</font>

313
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:45,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Zia Rodriguez.</font>

314
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:46,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zia.</font>

315
00:21:46,674 --> 00:21:48,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, how you doing?
- Yeah, real good. How are you?</font>

316
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:49,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

317
00:21:49,385 --> 00:21:51,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Franklin Webb. Systems analyst.</font>

318
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:54,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nervous flyer?</font>

319
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:57,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you ride a thousand-pound horse
that's been abused all its life?</font>

320
00:21:57,685 --> 00:22:00,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I rode my motorcycle through
the jungle with a pack of raptors.</font>

321
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:03,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not compatible.</font>

322
00:22:16,621 --> 00:22:17,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maisie?</font>

323
00:22:19,624 --> 00:22:22,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're always hiding from me.
This is not my job, looking for you.</font>

324
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:25,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maisie!</font>

325
00:22:28,132 --> 00:22:29,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maisie!</font>

326
00:22:32,178 --> 00:22:33,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come out!</font>

327
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:48,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boo!</font>

328
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:49,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You silly sausage.</font>

329
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:53,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be the death of me. You know,
one day, my heart might really stop.</font>

330
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:56,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what would you do?
Go and live in the forest with the lions?</font>

331
00:22:56,661 --> 00:22:59,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There are no lions in the forest.
- Your grandfather's been asking for you.</font>

332
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:00,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- Mmm.</font>

333
00:23:00,498 --> 00:23:02,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you go see your grandfather,
and then you go straight to your bath.</font>

334
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't want a bath.
- What?</font>

335
00:23:04,794 --> 00:23:07,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Queen's English, girl. Bath.
- Bath.</font>

336
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:08,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bath.
- Bath.</font>

337
00:23:08,297 --> 00:23:10,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bath, not "bath," you're not a wild animal.</font>

338
00:23:11,363 --> 00:23:12,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

339
00:23:17,723 --> 00:23:18,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Grandpa.</font>

340
00:23:18,808 --> 00:23:20,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, there you are.</font>

341
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:22,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come over and sit by me.</font>

342
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've missed you.</font>

343
00:23:23,688 --> 00:23:27,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was on safari all the way through
the Cretaceous to the Jurassic in one day.</font>

344
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:28,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my. What'd you see?</font>

345
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:31,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mostly herbivores.
There was one T. Rex, though.</font>

346
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:35,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Casualties, of course. Iris included.</font>

347
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:37,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She jumped out of her skin.</font>

348
00:23:38,477 --> 00:23:41,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have your mother's wicked sense of humor.</font>

349
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I look like her?</font>

350
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:48,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes.</font>

351
00:23:49,588 --> 00:23:51,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could be her mirror image.</font>

352
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:55,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did my mother ever visit the park?</font>

353
00:23:56,971 --> 00:23:59,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once, a long time ago.</font>

354
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She would've saved them, too, you know.</font>

355
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:06,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She would have saved them all.</font>

356
00:24:58,032 --> 00:25:00,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's two klicks past the LZ.</font>

357
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:04,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Claire.</font>

358
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ken Wheatley. Welcome back.</font>

359
00:25:10,086 --> 00:25:12,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quite an operation you've got going on here.</font>

360
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:15,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Lockwood takes his
humanitarian efforts very seriously.</font>

361
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:17,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the, uh, raptor wrangler?</font>

362
00:25:18,678 --> 00:25:19,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Animal behaviorist.</font>

363
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:22,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Owen Grady.
- Hey, Owen. Ken Wheatley.</font>

364
00:25:22,765 --> 00:25:24,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you are the Great White Hunter?</font>

365
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess. I'm the expedition facilitator.</font>

366
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God! It's hot.</font>

367
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:35,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's about to get a whole lot hotter.</font>

368
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:43,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep it moving! You're all clear!</font>

369
00:25:43,786 --> 00:25:46,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Go! You've got the green light!</font>

370
00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:51,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way! Let's go! Let's go! Keep it moving!</font>

371
00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:53,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold it! Hold up!</font>

372
00:26:03,556 --> 00:26:05,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Need some bug spray?</font>

373
00:26:05,308 --> 00:26:06,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bug spray?</font>

374
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:10,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The T. Rex would be dead by now, right?</font>

375
00:26:11,147 --> 00:26:13,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's impossible to know
the max lifespan of a clone</font>

376
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:15,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a completely different environment.</font>

377
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a caveman that would've lived 20 years.</font>

378
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:22,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feed him prime meals, give him health care,
he's gonna live 5 times as long.</font>

379
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:28,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, she'd be dead by now? Right?</font>

380
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:15,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad memories?</font>

381
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some were good.</font>

382
00:27:30,768 --> 00:27:32,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>

383
00:27:39,986 --> 00:27:40,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it the T. Rex?</font>

384
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:50,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to see this.</font>

385
00:27:51,247 --> 00:27:54,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Miss? Miss!</font>

386
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This area is not secured.</font>

387
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:29,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that.</font>

388
00:28:30,202 --> 00:28:32,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never thought I'd see one in real life.</font>

389
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:36,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's beautiful.</font>

390
00:28:48,137 --> 00:28:49,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we...</font>

391
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:04,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's go.</font>

392
00:29:09,283 --> 00:29:10,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Okay.</font>

393
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:12,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, main system...</font>

394
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And turn on the controls.</font>

395
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:18,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It should be working.</font>

396
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:26,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, tiger.</font>

397
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:28,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what you're doing?</font>

398
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:34,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After you, tiger.</font>

399
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:41,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we sure these
biometric chips are still transmitting?</font>

400
00:29:41,273 --> 00:29:42,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Battery would be dead by now.</font>

401
00:29:43,025 --> 00:29:46,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The dinosaur is the battery.
They're powered by body heat and movement.</font>

402
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:48,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hand.</font>

403
00:29:52,118 --> 00:29:53,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much longer until...</font>

404
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:57,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in.</font>

405
00:30:01,127 --> 00:30:02,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a large concentration
on the east dock.</font>

406
00:30:02,962 --> 00:30:05,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's our boat. We've already
captured a bunch of them.</font>

407
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:07,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without the tracking system?</font>

408
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:09,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The big herbivores are easy to find.</font>

409
00:30:09,468 --> 00:30:10,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you isolate that raptor?</font>

410
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:13,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I need a species code.
- D-9.</font>

411
00:30:16,797 --> 00:30:18,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There she is.</font>

412
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:19,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna need to borrow your truck.</font>

413
00:30:20,146 --> 00:30:23,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming with you. We don't know
what kind of condition she might be in.</font>

414
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss, things could get hairy out there.</font>

415
00:30:28,988 --> 00:30:32,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are powerful sedatives. One too many,
and she could have respiratory failure.</font>

416
00:30:33,034 --> 00:30:36,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, I'm not as soft and witless
as your comment implies.</font>

417
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:38,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, beefcake.</font>

418
00:30:39,332 --> 00:30:40,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Owen?</font>

419
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:44,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be careful, okay?</font>

420
00:30:48,674 --> 00:30:50,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I don't make it back,</font>

421
00:30:51,844 --> 00:30:54,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">remember, you're the one who made me come.</font>

422
00:30:57,391 --> 00:30:59,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be all right.</font>

423
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:11,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not going to get
any closer to her in this thing.</font>

424
00:31:12,948 --> 00:31:14,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We should stop here.
- Hold up.</font>

425
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:19,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Load out, look alive, stay alive.</font>

426
00:31:19,622 --> 00:31:20,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We got your back, brother.
- Yeah.</font>

427
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Claire, I'm going to have to track her alone.</font>

428
00:31:24,627 --> 00:31:26,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll need you to be my eyes
if she runs. Copy?</font>

429
00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:28,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Copy that.</font>

430
00:32:03,624 --> 00:32:06,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wheatley, I'm on fresh sign.
Wait for my signal.</font>

431
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you are.</font>

432
00:32:49,337 --> 00:32:50,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, girl, you miss me?</font>

433
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:54,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy. Hey!</font>

434
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:57,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

435
00:32:58,179 --> 00:32:59,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I brought you something.</font>

436
00:33:05,186 --> 00:33:06,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you go.</font>

437
00:33:07,563 --> 00:33:08,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

438
00:33:11,942 --> 00:33:13,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

439
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

440
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:20,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know me.</font>

441
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:24,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eyes on me.</font>

442
00:33:25,164 --> 00:33:26,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

443
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

444
00:33:30,252 --> 00:33:32,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know me.</font>

445
00:33:33,172 --> 00:33:34,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

446
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:36,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

447
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:39,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold your...</font>

448
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you to wait for my signal.</font>

449
00:33:48,312 --> 00:33:50,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back your men up right now.</font>

450
00:34:02,326 --> 00:34:03,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, wait! No, no! No, don't shoot her!</font>

451
00:34:12,211 --> 00:34:14,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wheatley, you son of a bitch!</font>

452
00:34:23,055 --> 00:34:24,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Owen!</font>

453
00:34:24,432 --> 00:34:25,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

454
00:34:25,808 --> 00:34:26,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Owen!</font>

455
00:34:36,193 --> 00:34:39,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shoot me and that animal dies.</font>

456
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we have the drop on you, sweetheart.</font>

457
00:34:41,824 --> 00:34:44,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's losing blood. And if I don't treat her,</font>

458
00:34:45,703 --> 00:34:47,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she'll never make it back to camp.</font>

459
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:57,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about this?</font>

460
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That animal dies, I shoot you.</font>

461
00:35:00,926 --> 00:35:02,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna take care of her.</font>

462
00:35:03,262 --> 00:35:04,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's move out!</font>

463
00:35:18,402 --> 00:35:20,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut the cord and let's go!
Let's get out of here!</font>

464
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:28,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no! Wait!</font>

465
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, are they protecting us?
What's going on?</font>

466
00:35:36,253 --> 00:35:37,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think so.</font>

467
00:35:40,341 --> 00:35:41,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why am I here?</font>

468
00:35:45,888 --> 00:35:48,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Mills, we got her done.
Mission accomplished.</font>

469
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:53,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just in the nick of time.</font>

470
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:57,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wheatley, what the hell is going on there?
We're a day behind schedule already.</font>

471
00:35:57,191 --> 00:35:59,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want that money in the bank
by the time I get back, all right?</font>

472
00:35:59,944 --> 00:36:03,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, good. Listen to me.
No more delays, okay? If we don't...</font>

473
00:36:03,238 --> 00:36:04,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mr. Mills?
- Not now, Maisie. Thank you.</font>

474
00:36:05,002 --> 00:36:06,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- If we don't get those animals...
- Mr. Mills, are the dinosaurs safe?</font>

475
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:08,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said not now!</font>

476
00:36:10,913 --> 00:36:12,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mills? Mills?</font>

477
00:36:12,623 --> 00:36:14,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, honey. This is an important call.</font>

478
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:17,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you go up to the library,
I'll meet you up there in a few minutes.</font>

479
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

480
00:36:19,088 --> 00:36:20,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you all about it, I promise.</font>

481
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:22,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

482
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:28,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wheatley, you get those animals here now!</font>

483
00:36:28,472 --> 00:36:30,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want that bonus. We got the blue one.</font>

484
00:36:30,641 --> 00:36:32,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring her to me first!</font>

485
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:33,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

486
00:37:49,553 --> 00:37:51,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

487
00:38:09,573 --> 00:38:11,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, can anyone hear me?</font>

488
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:12,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

489
00:38:12,952 --> 00:38:14,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, is anybody there?</font>

490
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can anybody copy?</font>

491
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:20,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm... I'm trying everything. It's jammed.</font>

492
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Just take the job, son, build your
people skills." Yeah, thanks, Dad.</font>

493
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:27,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.</font>

494
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:30,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Proximity alert.</font>

495
00:38:32,305 --> 00:38:33,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something's coming.</font>

496
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:35,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where does that tunnel lead?</font>

497
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:38,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it connects to the rest of the...</font>

498
00:38:39,353 --> 00:38:40,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Park.</font>

499
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the T. Rex, it's the T. Rex!
Claire, it's the T. Rex.</font>

500
00:38:46,986 --> 00:38:48,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the T. Rex, it's the T. Rex.</font>

501
00:38:48,404 --> 00:38:49,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you stop? It's not the T. Rex!</font>

502
00:38:51,148 --> 00:38:52,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably.</font>

503
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:53,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Probably"?</font>

504
00:38:55,828 --> 00:38:59,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lava! Lava! Lava! Lava!</font>

505
00:38:59,415 --> 00:39:00,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deep breaths, Franklin.</font>

506
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:18,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? Not a T. Rex!</font>

507
00:39:19,143 --> 00:39:20,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is this better?</font>

508
00:39:31,656 --> 00:39:34,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Claire, what do we do? What do we do?</font>

509
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:37,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's stuck!</font>

510
00:39:38,412 --> 00:39:39,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chair!</font>

511
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:57,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Let's go!</font>

512
00:39:58,391 --> 00:39:59,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Franklin!</font>

513
00:40:00,977 --> 00:40:03,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We made it! Yeah!</font>

514
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:26,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on, come on!</font>

515
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, yes, go, go!</font>

516
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:32,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go!</font>

517
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Claire!</font>

518
00:40:46,939 --> 00:40:47,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy...</font>

519
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>

520
00:41:02,913 --> 00:41:04,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>

521
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:07,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>

522
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>

523
00:41:26,604 --> 00:41:28,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

524
00:42:19,573 --> 00:42:20,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Go!</font>

525
00:42:21,158 --> 00:42:22,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- We're okay.</font>

526
00:42:22,702 --> 00:42:24,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Buckle up.
- It's okay.</font>

527
00:42:25,121 --> 00:42:26,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in!</font>

528
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:46,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Owen!</font>

529
00:44:39,422 --> 00:44:40,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta get out.</font>

530
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:42,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just fell from the cliff. We're alive.</font>

531
00:44:43,551 --> 00:44:44,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're alive!</font>

532
00:44:44,844 --> 00:44:46,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Franklin, move!</font>

533
00:44:46,971 --> 00:44:48,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no!</font>

534
00:44:50,474 --> 00:44:53,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Claire, we're gonna sink!
Water's leaking!</font>

535
00:44:55,537 --> 00:44:57,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God. We need to get out!</font>

536
00:45:00,818 --> 00:45:02,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Franklin, watch out!</font>

537
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:07,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna go home!</font>

538
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:12,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Owen. Owen!</font>

539
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:14,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Owen?</font>

540
00:45:14,415 --> 00:45:15,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Owen. Okay.</font>

541
00:45:17,084 --> 00:45:18,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move! Move!</font>

542
00:45:23,257 --> 00:45:24,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No, no, no!</font>

543
00:45:25,843 --> 00:45:27,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Push!</font>

544
00:45:29,388 --> 00:45:31,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Owen! No.</font>

545
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:37,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where's he going?
- Okay, don't panic. Don't panic.</font>

546
00:45:37,521 --> 00:45:39,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're running out of air.
We're not gonna make it.</font>

547
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:42,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are. We are. Take a deep breath.</font>

548
00:46:53,764 --> 00:46:54,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Zia?</font>

549
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:57,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a double-cross.
They took her, she must be with Blue.</font>

550
00:46:57,351 --> 00:46:59,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Can you still track them?</font>

551
00:47:01,522 --> 00:47:02,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not anymore.</font>

552
00:47:04,442 --> 00:47:05,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a lie.</font>

553
00:47:05,693 --> 00:47:07,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a lie. Bastards!</font>

554
00:47:07,653 --> 00:47:09,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was all a lie!</font>

555
00:47:23,586 --> 00:47:24,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not all of it.</font>

556
00:47:34,513 --> 00:47:37,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's move it! Move! Move!</font>

557
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything of value, I want on that boat!</font>

558
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:42,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How you doing?
- The bolt won't give!</font>

559
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:45,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just button it up,
and we'll tow it on! Let's go!</font>

560
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:48,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lock it up! Move it out!</font>

561
00:47:51,364 --> 00:47:53,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, now.</font>

562
00:48:07,713 --> 00:48:10,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hang on! Wait up!</font>

563
00:48:10,925 --> 00:48:13,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop that truck! Stop it!</font>

564
00:48:16,097 --> 00:48:19,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, sweetheart. Hello, hello.</font>

565
00:48:27,566 --> 00:48:28,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beautiful.</font>

566
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:31,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna feel that when you wake up.</font>

567
00:48:32,655 --> 00:48:34,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, put your weapon down!</font>

568
00:48:35,116 --> 00:48:36,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got the barrel pointed right at her head!</font>

569
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:41,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have Zia. They're loading out.</font>

570
00:48:41,414 --> 00:48:43,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If they already had the dinosaurs,
why did they need us?</font>

571
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:46,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They needed the tracking system
to capture Blue.</font>

572
00:48:47,712 --> 00:48:49,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There she is. She don't look good.</font>

573
00:48:53,968 --> 00:48:55,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to get on that boat.</font>

574
00:48:55,511 --> 00:48:57,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The rock's good. We're safe on the rock.</font>

575
00:48:57,221 --> 00:48:58,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the boat or the lava, Franklin.</font>

576
00:48:59,307 --> 00:49:01,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, boat's good.
I'm all about the boat.</font>

577
00:49:03,894 --> 00:49:05,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, get on the boat!</font>

578
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on the boat, now! Go, go!</font>

579
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:12,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Move it, move it!
- Go, go, go!</font>

580
00:49:15,531 --> 00:49:16,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get that truck!</font>

581
00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:36,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Franklin!
- Hey, get that truck going!</font>

582
00:49:36,594 --> 00:49:37,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

583
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:39,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You okay?
- Am I dead?</font>

584
00:49:39,972 --> 00:49:41,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not yet, kid.</font>

585
00:49:48,189 --> 00:49:49,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

586
00:49:54,445 --> 00:49:57,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Give me your hand! Reach!</font>

587
00:49:57,323 --> 00:49:58,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, reach!</font>

588
00:50:10,544 --> 00:50:11,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on!</font>

589
00:52:15,962 --> 00:52:16,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Mills?</font>

590
00:52:17,713 --> 00:52:19,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your visitor's waiting.</font>

591
00:52:24,095 --> 00:52:25,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Eversoll.</font>

592
00:52:25,972 --> 00:52:28,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a pleasure to meet you in person
after all this time. How are you?</font>

593
00:52:28,683 --> 00:52:29,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me.
- Yeah?</font>

594
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:32,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where are the dinosaurs?
- The dinosaurs are, uh, are en route.</font>

595
00:52:33,145 --> 00:52:35,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, so, am I supposed to sell these ones?</font>

596
00:52:35,481 --> 00:52:37,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't need to worry, okay?
They will be here soon.</font>

597
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:42,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't really work with amateurs, so I'm
gonna contact my buyers and call this off.</font>

598
00:52:42,697 --> 00:52:45,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will be here tomorrow,
and your buyers won't be disappointed.</font>

599
00:52:45,241 --> 00:52:46,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me, whatever their interest,</font>

600
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:50,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">agricultural, industrial, sport hunting,
we will have something to suit them.</font>

601
00:52:50,663 --> 00:52:55,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">11 species, each with unique
biopharmaceutical properties.</font>

602
00:52:55,293 --> 00:52:57,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I estimate 4 million per species.</font>

603
00:52:58,212 --> 00:53:01,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 million is a slow Tuesday
where I'm from.</font>

604
00:53:02,466 --> 00:53:03,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're wasting my time.</font>

605
00:53:03,676 --> 00:53:05,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ever made 100 million on a Tuesday?</font>

606
00:53:05,971 --> 00:53:07,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

607
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:10,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All this is in the past.</font>

608
00:53:11,517 --> 00:53:13,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna talk to you about the future.</font>

609
00:53:14,812 --> 00:53:16,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll give you 10 minutes.</font>

610
00:53:18,899 --> 00:53:21,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole point of selling
the Isla Nublar dinosaurs</font>

611
00:53:21,861 --> 00:53:24,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is to finance our future operations here.</font>

612
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's, uh, seed money.</font>

613
00:53:26,615 --> 00:53:29,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call it an overture to something
much more ambitious.</font>

614
00:53:29,785 --> 00:53:32,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, and more lucrative, I guess.</font>

615
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:35,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, we've reactivated the old facilities,</font>

616
00:53:35,416 --> 00:53:39,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">updated the technology, and imported
the best geneticists from around the world.</font>

617
00:53:39,503 --> 00:53:41,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This operation has been
many years in the planning.</font>

618
00:53:41,672 --> 00:53:43,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Genetic power is an uncharted frontier.</font>

619
00:53:44,884 --> 00:53:48,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The potential for growth
is more than you can fathom.</font>

620
00:53:50,723 --> 00:53:51,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way, please.</font>

621
00:53:52,308 --> 00:53:56,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the entire run of our sorry history
has taught us one irrevocable lesson,</font>

622
00:53:56,854 --> 00:54:00,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's that man is inevitably drawn to war</font>

623
00:54:00,274 --> 00:54:03,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and is willing to use
any means necessary to win it.</font>

624
00:54:04,403 --> 00:54:05,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna weaponize them?</font>

625
00:54:06,072 --> 00:54:07,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been using animals
in combat for centuries.</font>

626
00:54:08,115 --> 00:54:09,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Horses, elephants.</font>

627
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:13,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Soviets used disease-bearing rats
against the Germans at Stalingrad.</font>

628
00:54:13,287 --> 00:54:14,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, yes.</font>

629
00:54:14,497 --> 00:54:19,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our geneticists have created a direct
descendant of Henry Wu's masterpiece,</font>

630
00:54:19,293 --> 00:54:21,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the animal that took down Jurassic World.</font>

631
00:54:22,588 --> 00:54:23,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indominus Rex.</font>

632
00:54:24,131 --> 00:54:27,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her DNA, retrieved from the island
way before its destruction,</font>

633
00:54:27,385 --> 00:54:31,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">forms the architecture
of a completely new creature.</font>

634
00:54:31,806 --> 00:54:35,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every bone and muscle designed
for hunting and killing.</font>

635
00:54:35,351 --> 00:54:37,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And thanks to Owen Grady's research,</font>

636
00:54:37,895 --> 00:54:40,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it follows human command.</font>

637
00:54:40,606 --> 00:54:43,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We call it the Indoraptor.</font>

638
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grandpa?</font>

639
00:54:53,202 --> 00:54:54,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grandpa?</font>

640
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:14,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grandpa.</font>

641
00:55:14,932 --> 00:55:16,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maisie, what are you doing up?</font>

642
00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:19,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was a man here today with Mr. Mills.</font>

643
00:55:20,187 --> 00:55:23,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was probably just some business
about the sanctuary. That's all.</font>

644
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:26,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard them talking.
They're going to sell the dinosaurs.</font>

645
00:55:26,569 --> 00:55:28,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're bringing them here.
- Oh. Huh.</font>

646
00:55:28,821 --> 00:55:31,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sure you misunderstood.
- I know what I heard, Grandpa.</font>

647
00:55:31,532 --> 00:55:33,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maisie, it's way past your bedtime.</font>

648
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:36,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's talk about this in the morning.</font>

649
00:55:36,579 --> 00:55:39,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But...
- Maisie, I'll find out tomorrow.</font>

650
00:55:39,874 --> 00:55:41,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to bed.</font>

651
00:55:43,002 --> 00:55:44,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good night.</font>

652
00:55:44,086 --> 00:55:45,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good night, my heart.</font>

653
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:16,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus.</font>

654
00:56:24,543 --> 00:56:25,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, Blue, just a little longer.</font>

655
00:56:27,338 --> 00:56:28,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God! You guys are alive!</font>

656
00:56:33,844 --> 00:56:36,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, look what they've done to her.
- Who are these assholes?</font>

657
00:56:36,889 --> 00:56:38,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Animal traffickers.
Look how they're treating them.</font>

658
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:41,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not gonna take them
to a sanctuary, they're gonna sell them.</font>

659
00:56:41,268 --> 00:56:42,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not Blue, they need her for something else.</font>

660
00:56:43,104 --> 00:56:45,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Like what?
- I don't know, but she's...</font>

661
00:56:45,648 --> 00:56:48,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's hemorrhaging, and I don't have
instruments and they want to keep her alive.</font>

662
00:56:48,943 --> 00:56:49,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

663
00:56:51,821 --> 00:56:53,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're all right, you're all right.
- Claire, come here.</font>

664
00:56:53,656 --> 00:56:55,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Put your hand here.</font>

665
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:56,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steady pressure.</font>

666
00:56:56,751 --> 00:56:58,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, hey.</font>

667
00:56:59,704 --> 00:57:00,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out.</font>

668
00:57:01,038 --> 00:57:03,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't take the bullet out
without a transfusion from another animal.</font>

669
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which one of you knows how to find a vein?</font>

670
00:57:05,584 --> 00:57:07,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! I did a blood drive for the Red Cross.</font>

671
00:57:08,212 --> 00:57:09,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great. Okay.</font>

672
00:57:10,673 --> 00:57:12,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Franklin, take over for Claire.</font>

673
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:13,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.</font>

674
00:57:13,926 --> 00:57:15,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Franklin, now!</font>

675
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steady pressure.</font>

676
00:57:20,549 --> 00:57:23,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Is it in my mouth?</font>

677
00:57:23,728 --> 00:57:25,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did it get in my mouth?
- Mmm-mmm.</font>

678
00:57:25,187 --> 00:57:26,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You sure?
- You're good.</font>

679
00:57:26,605 --> 00:57:28,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can feel it on my face.
All of the animals should be sedated.</font>

680
00:57:28,983 --> 00:57:32,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look for any kind of Tetanuran,
their blood type should be close enough.</font>

681
00:57:32,236 --> 00:57:35,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look for carnivores with 2
or 3 fingers. No more than 3.</font>

682
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:39,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think there's one onboard.</font>

683
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta be kidding me.</font>

684
00:58:12,652 --> 00:58:13,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's tranqued.</font>

685
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:21,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay. Okay, I got it. Come on.</font>

686
00:58:22,203 --> 00:58:23,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

687
00:58:28,209 --> 00:58:30,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. Are you okay?</font>

688
00:58:32,046 --> 00:58:33,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm okay.</font>

689
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:35,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

690
00:58:40,638 --> 00:58:43,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're gonna have to do it.
- I can't. The skin is too thick.</font>

691
00:58:43,474 --> 00:58:46,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to use both my hands to put
pressure on the vein. You gotta do it.</font>

692
00:58:46,644 --> 00:58:50,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I... I can't... I can't reach.
- You're gonna have to climb up there.</font>

693
00:58:51,482 --> 00:58:53,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm not... No, no.
I'm not gonna climb up there.</font>

694
00:58:53,985 --> 00:58:55,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be okay. It's like riding a bull.</font>

695
00:58:55,653 --> 00:58:58,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Riding a bull"? I didn't grow up at
a rodeo or wherever you came from.</font>

696
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:02,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's asleep now. I can't say that she's
gonna be asleep a minute from now so get up.</font>

697
00:59:02,868 --> 00:59:03,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, fine.</font>

698
00:59:04,078 --> 00:59:06,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, she stinks.</font>

699
00:59:06,998 --> 00:59:10,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gently. Gently. No, no, no.</font>

700
00:59:20,303 --> 00:59:21,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good job.</font>

701
00:59:21,846 --> 00:59:24,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're making this look totally normal.</font>

702
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna have to jam it
in there, it's really thick skin.</font>

703
00:59:30,229 --> 00:59:31,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ready?
- Yeah.</font>

704
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay. 1, 2...
- 1, 2...</font>

705
00:59:33,858 --> 00:59:35,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stab!</font>

706
00:59:36,444 --> 00:59:37,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Owen!</font>

707
00:59:46,495 --> 00:59:48,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's working.</font>

708
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:52,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The pee is silent.</font>

709
00:59:52,376 --> 00:59:53,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That door is open.</font>

710
00:59:53,753 --> 00:59:54,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it.</font>

711
01:00:13,064 --> 01:00:14,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bars! The bars, Owen.</font>

712
01:00:15,024 --> 01:00:17,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Owen, I can get through there. Come on.</font>

713
01:00:30,748 --> 01:00:32,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jump, Owen!</font>

714
01:00:38,547 --> 01:00:40,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Owen, jump. Now!</font>

715
01:00:50,643 --> 01:00:51,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you see that?</font>

716
01:00:52,603 --> 01:00:53,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh.</font>

717
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:55,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please tell me you got the blood.</font>

718
01:02:20,524 --> 01:02:22,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Delta.
She's one of the holdover theropods,</font>

719
01:02:22,818 --> 01:02:24,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one of the survivors from the second group.</font>

720
01:02:25,154 --> 01:02:29,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, watch this. I show
anysign of weakness whatsoever...</font>

721
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:40,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See that? Day 176. Blue is showing
unprecedented levels of compliance.</font>

722
01:02:41,045 --> 01:02:42,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here I am with Blue.</font>

723
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:45,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a theropod from the new group.</font>

724
01:02:46,717 --> 01:02:48,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I show signs of weakness...</font>

725
01:03:02,858 --> 01:03:03,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

726
01:03:05,319 --> 01:03:06,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm okay.</font>

727
01:03:09,031 --> 01:03:10,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's pretty extraordinary.</font>

728
01:03:22,169 --> 01:03:24,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blue, displaying levels</font>

729
01:03:24,338 --> 01:03:27,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of interest, concern,</font>

730
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:30,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hyper-intelligence, cognitive bonding.</font>

731
01:03:31,012 --> 01:03:32,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See that?</font>

732
01:03:33,556 --> 01:03:35,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's tilting her head,
she's craning forward.</font>

733
01:03:36,976 --> 01:03:39,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Increased eye movement. She's curious.</font>

734
01:03:39,812 --> 01:03:41,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's showing empathy.</font>

735
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:45,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'm gonna make an incision
in her leg to remove the bullet.</font>

736
01:03:50,156 --> 01:03:52,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a lot of muscle tissue.</font>

737
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:25,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's gonna be okay.</font>

738
01:04:32,782 --> 01:04:33,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blue is the key.</font>

739
01:04:36,077 --> 01:04:40,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it. You have Blue,
you get these raptors to do anything.</font>

740
01:04:40,665 --> 01:04:43,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're sure she'll live?
- If it dies, we have blood samples.</font>

741
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:44,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. That's not good enough.</font>

742
01:04:45,086 --> 01:04:48,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The raptor is a behavioral specimen.
We need her in good health.</font>

743
01:04:48,339 --> 01:04:52,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't shoot the damn thing.
What do you want me to do, huh?</font>

744
01:04:52,927 --> 01:04:57,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have the faintest
comprehension of what I'm doing here.</font>

745
01:04:57,848 --> 01:05:02,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you understand the complexity
of creating an entirely new life form?</font>

746
01:05:02,186 --> 01:05:05,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, but I understand the complexity
of paying for it, okay?</font>

747
01:05:05,523 --> 01:05:09,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All your money will have been wasted
if I don't get Blue here in good health.</font>

748
01:05:09,402 --> 01:05:11,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To get the next iteration under control,</font>

749
01:05:11,988 --> 01:05:15,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it needs to form a familial bond
with a closely related genetic link.</font>

750
01:05:15,658 --> 01:05:17,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- English, Henry.
- It needs a mother!</font>

751
01:05:20,162 --> 01:05:24,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blue's DNA will be part
of the next Indoraptor's makeup.</font>

752
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:28,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, it will be genetically coded to recognize
her authority and assume her traits.</font>

753
01:05:28,838 --> 01:05:30,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Empathy. Obedience.</font>

754
01:05:30,172 --> 01:05:32,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything the prototype
you have now is missing.</font>

755
01:05:32,675 --> 01:05:34,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so how long is this gonna take?</font>

756
01:05:34,219 --> 01:05:37,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a sprint, Mr. Mills.
It's a marathon.</font>

757
01:05:37,221 --> 01:05:38,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A marathon sounds expensive.</font>

758
01:05:39,223 --> 01:05:42,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, time is running out,
and so is my patience, Henry.</font>

759
01:05:42,393 --> 01:05:45,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to understand,
this is all uncharted territory.</font>

760
01:05:45,604 --> 01:05:49,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A wolf, genetically, is barely
distinguishable from a bulldog,</font>

761
01:05:49,775 --> 01:05:51,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but within that gray area</font>

762
01:05:53,696 --> 01:05:54,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is art.</font>

763
01:05:55,572 --> 01:05:59,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spare me the poetry, Henry.
Can you do it? Can you do it?</font>

764
01:05:59,285 --> 01:06:00,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I can do it.</font>

765
01:06:01,245 --> 01:06:02,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then do it.</font>

766
01:06:02,955 --> 01:06:04,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

767
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:06,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, you're a pain in the ass.</font>

768
01:06:19,639 --> 01:06:21,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Hey! Maisie!</font>

769
01:06:24,644 --> 01:06:27,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that? What is it?</font>

770
01:06:34,779 --> 01:06:37,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep her in there and keep the door locked.</font>

771
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:38,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to keep her locked in?</font>

772
01:06:39,075 --> 01:06:40,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's exactly what I want.</font>

773
01:06:40,576 --> 01:06:42,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir Benjamin needs to see you now.</font>

774
01:06:45,915 --> 01:06:47,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe it's important.</font>

775
01:07:18,489 --> 01:07:21,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All crew, prepare for docking.</font>

776
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All crew, prepare for docking.</font>

777
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's move it, boys.</font>

778
01:07:24,453 --> 01:07:26,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez! Will somebody shut that thing up?
It sounds like my ex-wife.</font>

779
01:07:27,081 --> 01:07:28,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here.</font>

780
01:07:28,499 --> 01:07:29,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where?</font>

781
01:07:29,792 --> 01:07:31,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get in your truck and let's go.</font>

782
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:32,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Move. Move!
- Move, move, move!</font>

783
01:07:33,963 --> 01:07:35,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a heartbeat?</font>

784
01:07:35,423 --> 01:07:36,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Do you?</font>

785
01:07:37,091 --> 01:07:38,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need blood samples.</font>

786
01:07:38,259 --> 01:07:42,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not here to help you reset the food
chain, so take your own damn samples.</font>

787
01:07:46,058 --> 01:07:47,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a nasty woman.</font>

788
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:49,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, now, now. Go.</font>

789
01:07:50,271 --> 01:07:53,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Attention, all crew. Attention, all crew.</font>

790
01:07:53,858 --> 01:07:56,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drivers, get to your vehicles.</font>

791
01:07:56,986 --> 01:07:57,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

792
01:07:59,113 --> 01:08:00,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the hell is going on?
- I was...</font>

793
01:08:02,033 --> 01:08:03,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I needed an extra pair of hands.
He volunteered.</font>

794
01:08:04,118 --> 01:08:05,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you deck crew?
- Aye, aye.</font>

795
01:08:05,995 --> 01:08:07,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're loading out. Follow me.</font>

796
01:08:07,663 --> 01:08:09,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, does that mean
we're leaving the ship right now?</font>

797
01:08:09,415 --> 01:08:11,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is what "loading out" means.
Now get moving. Come on, follow me.</font>

798
01:08:12,918 --> 01:08:14,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, kid. There's lots to do.
- Shit!</font>

799
01:08:14,962 --> 01:08:17,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, no. He's not gonna make it.
- Get a move on. Come on.</font>

800
01:08:17,173 --> 01:08:19,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Move it! Come on. Move!
- We have to help him.</font>

801
01:08:19,592 --> 01:08:21,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay here, I'll get him.</font>

802
01:08:22,637 --> 01:08:24,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no time. Let's go.</font>

803
01:08:30,186 --> 01:08:31,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got 5. I'm on it.</font>

804
01:08:34,148 --> 01:08:35,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is this truck still here?</font>

805
01:08:38,903 --> 01:08:41,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good to go!
- Roll out!</font>

806
01:08:42,782 --> 01:08:43,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are they taking them?</font>

807
01:08:44,659 --> 01:08:47,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're about to find out.
- Let's go!</font>

808
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:48,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready to roll!</font>

809
01:08:49,038 --> 01:08:50,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep it coming!</font>

810
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:55,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move it out! Keep it rolling!</font>

811
01:08:56,587 --> 01:08:57,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good to go!</font>

812
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:59,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, girl.</font>

813
01:09:06,472 --> 01:09:07,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

814
01:09:15,481 --> 01:09:17,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Lockwood's estate.</font>

815
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:21,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must have one big-ass garage.</font>

816
01:09:35,626 --> 01:09:38,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go! We want this offloaded in 10 mikes!</font>

817
01:09:39,046 --> 01:09:40,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big door's open.</font>

818
01:10:07,408 --> 01:10:10,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you really think
you could get away with it?</font>

819
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:13,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my own house.</font>

820
01:10:13,331 --> 01:10:14,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You entrusted me</font>

821
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:18,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to guide your fortune into the future.</font>

822
01:10:19,295 --> 01:10:21,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I have done that.
- Damn you!</font>

823
01:10:25,217 --> 01:10:26,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pick up that phone.</font>

824
01:10:26,886 --> 01:10:29,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to call the police.</font>

825
01:10:30,556 --> 01:10:33,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be easier if the story comes from you.</font>

826
01:10:35,561 --> 01:10:36,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you say, sir.</font>

827
01:10:44,528 --> 01:10:48,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I've been thinking,
John Hammond was right.</font>

828
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:52,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was an unholy thing that you did.</font>

829
01:10:55,957 --> 01:10:58,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not the only guilty one here, am I, sir?</font>

830
01:11:18,437 --> 01:11:19,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

831
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:23,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We hit that town, we call
the cavalry, shut this down.</font>

832
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:30,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo. Hello.</font>

833
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:32,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have stayed on the island.</font>

834
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better odds.</font>

835
01:11:45,798 --> 01:11:46,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Claire.</font>

836
01:11:48,718 --> 01:11:50,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wanted to come and apologize.</font>

837
01:11:51,387 --> 01:11:53,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't wanna bring you into any of this,</font>

838
01:11:53,347 --> 01:11:56,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it was the only way
that we could get the raptor.</font>

839
01:11:56,642 --> 01:11:57,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We needed it.</font>

840
01:11:58,227 --> 01:11:59,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

841
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:02,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what? This is it?</font>

842
01:12:03,941 --> 01:12:05,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you're a smart guy, you could have</font>

843
01:12:06,068 --> 01:12:08,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">started a foundation,
cured cancer, but instead you,</font>

844
01:12:09,989 --> 01:12:10,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what?</font>

845
01:12:12,033 --> 01:12:13,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sell endangered species?</font>

846
01:12:13,409 --> 01:12:14,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saved these animals.</font>

847
01:12:14,827 --> 01:12:16,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You betrayed a dying man for money.</font>

848
01:12:16,829 --> 01:12:20,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Claire, I admire your idealism,
but we both exploited these animals.</font>

849
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:22,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least I have the integrity to admit it.</font>

850
01:12:23,044 --> 01:12:24,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never, ever did anything remotely illegal.</font>

851
01:12:25,004 --> 01:12:27,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You authorized the creation
of the Indominus Rex.</font>

852
01:12:28,466 --> 01:12:32,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You exploited a living thing
in a cage for money.</font>

853
01:12:32,261 --> 01:12:34,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is that different? Huh?</font>

854
01:12:34,347 --> 01:12:37,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you, the man who proved
raptors can follow orders.</font>

855
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never thought about the applications
of your research, Owen?</font>

856
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:43,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many millions a trained
predator might be worth?</font>

857
01:12:46,776 --> 01:12:50,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two, you're the parents of the new world.</font>

858
01:12:53,366 --> 01:12:55,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Let him go.</font>

859
01:12:55,534 --> 01:12:57,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Owen.
- I think I'll break it.</font>

860
01:12:57,662 --> 01:12:58,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let him go.</font>

861
01:13:02,917 --> 01:13:04,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Claire, I just want...</font>

862
01:13:12,969 --> 01:13:14,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say, how we gonna end this?</font>

863
01:13:14,428 --> 01:13:18,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, as far as everybody else is
concerned, they burned up on the island.</font>

864
01:13:35,825 --> 01:13:38,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buyers on approach. Looks like a full house.</font>

865
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:40,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roger that.</font>

866
01:14:07,606 --> 01:14:09,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good evening.
- Good evening.</font>

867
01:14:09,275 --> 01:14:10,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Welcome, gentlemen.
- Good evening.</font>

868
01:14:10,568 --> 01:14:11,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome.</font>

869
01:14:13,404 --> 01:14:16,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And these guys are development rep
for Aldaris Pharmaceuticals.</font>

870
01:14:17,074 --> 01:14:18,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great.</font>

871
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:22,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The guy in the beard is a proxy for
Gregor Adlrich, a Slovenian arms dealer.</font>

872
01:14:24,165 --> 01:14:26,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Equine buyers.</font>

873
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:28,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rand Magnus, an oil magnate from Houston.</font>

874
01:14:29,128 --> 01:14:30,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's their interest?</font>

875
01:14:30,463 --> 01:14:31,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strictly personal.</font>

876
01:14:32,298 --> 01:14:35,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His kid wants a baby Triceratops.</font>

877
01:14:36,177 --> 01:14:37,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Glenn, how's Janet?</font>

878
01:14:37,678 --> 01:14:39,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's doing fine, thanks.</font>

879
01:14:39,865 --> 01:14:41,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Straight ahead, Glenn.</font>

880
01:14:57,907 --> 01:15:00,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he only wants carnivores. Two of them.</font>

881
01:15:01,285 --> 01:15:03,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like Lockwood's
gonna have a very good night.</font>

882
01:15:04,246 --> 01:15:05,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will he be joining us?</font>

883
01:15:05,748 --> 01:15:07,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um... That's very unlikely.</font>

884
01:15:20,513 --> 01:15:21,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grandpa?</font>

885
01:15:29,522 --> 01:15:30,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grandpa?</font>

886
01:15:31,857 --> 01:15:33,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grandpa, wake up.</font>

887
01:15:35,486 --> 01:15:36,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grandpa!</font>

888
01:15:38,047 --> 01:15:40,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grandpa, wake up. Wake up.</font>

889
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:42,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iris!</font>

890
01:15:56,257 --> 01:15:57,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iris!</font>

891
01:16:00,428 --> 01:16:01,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's over.</font>

892
01:16:04,765 --> 01:16:05,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a tragedy.</font>

893
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:12,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suppose now he's gone,</font>

894
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:14,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'll be looking for another situation.</font>

895
01:16:15,067 --> 01:16:16,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

896
01:16:17,403 --> 01:16:18,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maisie needs me.</font>

897
01:16:20,865 --> 01:16:22,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm her guardian now.</font>

898
01:16:24,368 --> 01:16:26,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What she needs is no longer your concern.</font>

899
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't understand her the way I do.</font>

900
01:16:31,792 --> 01:16:33,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand her value.</font>

901
01:16:35,296 --> 01:16:36,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I raised her.</font>

902
01:16:37,632 --> 01:16:39,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I raised both of them.</font>

903
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please, Mr. Mills.
- Goodbye, Iris.</font>

904
01:17:27,014 --> 01:17:30,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you remember the first time
you saw a dinosaur?</font>

905
01:17:33,312 --> 01:17:37,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First time you see them, it's like a miracle.</font>

906
01:17:37,817 --> 01:17:40,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You read about them in books,
you see the bones in museums,</font>

907
01:17:40,778 --> 01:17:43,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you don't really believe it.</font>

908
01:17:43,531 --> 01:17:45,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're like myths.</font>

909
01:17:46,033 --> 01:17:47,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then you see</font>

910
01:17:48,911 --> 01:17:50,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that first one alive.</font>

911
01:17:56,002 --> 01:17:57,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not your fault.</font>

912
01:17:58,379 --> 01:17:59,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it is.</font>

913
01:17:59,547 --> 01:18:00,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

914
01:18:02,508 --> 01:18:04,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one's on me.</font>

915
01:18:06,637 --> 01:18:08,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I showed them the way.</font>

916
01:18:10,975 --> 01:18:12,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen.</font>

917
01:18:12,143 --> 01:18:15,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and I are gonna have plenty
of time to talk about this later.</font>

918
01:18:15,521 --> 01:18:16,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If there is a later.</font>

919
01:18:16,981 --> 01:18:18,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, there is.</font>

920
01:18:20,776 --> 01:18:22,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a cabin to finish.</font>

921
01:18:30,995 --> 01:18:32,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

922
01:18:36,709 --> 01:18:39,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, look who just woke up.</font>

923
01:18:42,161 --> 01:18:43,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>

924
01:18:50,306 --> 01:18:51,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're getting out of here.</font>

925
01:18:53,434 --> 01:18:57,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome, ladies, gentlemen,</font>

926
01:18:57,563 --> 01:19:00,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to this extraordinary evening.</font>

927
01:19:01,108 --> 01:19:04,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's dive right in with lot number one,</font>

928
01:19:06,155 --> 01:19:08,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Ankylosaurus.</font>

929
01:19:10,076 --> 01:19:12,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a herbivorous quadruped,</font>

930
01:19:12,787 --> 01:19:14,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">late Cretaceous.</font>

931
01:19:14,914 --> 01:19:18,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is one of the largest armored dinosaurs,</font>

932
01:19:19,335 --> 01:19:23,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">known by paleontologists as a living tank.</font>

933
01:19:29,637 --> 01:19:30,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

934
01:19:31,138 --> 01:19:32,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Escaping.</font>

935
01:19:32,515 --> 01:19:33,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure about this?</font>

936
01:19:33,849 --> 01:19:34,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope.</font>

937
01:19:36,978 --> 01:19:39,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have $4 million, anyone 5?</font>

938
01:19:40,147 --> 01:19:41,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 5.
- $5 million.</font>

939
01:19:41,941 --> 01:19:43,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">$5 million. Do I hear 6?</font>

940
01:19:43,567 --> 01:19:45,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- $6 million.
- $6 million, thank you.</font>

941
01:19:45,403 --> 01:19:47,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any increase on 6? 7. $7 million.</font>

942
01:19:47,905 --> 01:19:48,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">$8 million.</font>

943
01:19:49,031 --> 01:19:51,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">9 million on the phones.
Do I hear 10 million?</font>

944
01:19:51,951 --> 01:19:53,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 10 million? 10 million.
- 10.</font>

945
01:19:53,619 --> 01:19:55,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">$10 million! Once, twice...</font>

946
01:19:56,497 --> 01:19:57,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sold!</font>

just about to go and find our friends</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">We call it the Indoraptor.</font>

1013
01:24:39,864 --> 01:24:44,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The perfect weapon for the modern age.
Built for combat.</font>

1014
01:24:44,577 --> 01:24:48,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With tactical responses more acute
than any human soldier.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that thing?</font>

comparable to the Velociraptor.</font>

01:25:20,863 --> 01:25:24,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Biospecs include a heightened sense of smell</font>

1023
01:25:24,241 --> 01:25:28,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and trained to respond
to a pulse-coded laser targeting system,</font>

signal triggers the attack.</font>

1028
01:25:58,943 --> 01:26:01,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This animal is relentless.</font>

This animal is not for sale.</font>

1045

01:33:39,445 --> 01:33:42,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think drove Hammond
and Lockwood apart, huh?</font>

1085
01:33:42,865 --> 01:33:46,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lockwood never had a grandchild.</font>

1086
01:33:47,036 --> 01:33:48,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just wanted his daughter back.</font>

1087
01:33:51,707 --> 01:33:53,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he had the technology.</font>

1088
01:33:54,543 --> 01:33:56,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He created another.</font>

1089
01:33:58,005 --> 01:33:59,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He made her again.</font>

1090
01:34:03,427 --> 01:34:04,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>

1091
01:34:10,017 --> 01:34:11,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

1092
01:34:13,062 --> 01:34:14,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1093
01:34:15,231 --> 01:34:17,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eggs need to go in a sterile environment.</font>

1094
01:34:19,193 --> 01:34:20,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are those genome kits?</font>

1095
01:34:27,451 --> 01:34:30,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get this to Mills. Be very careful,
it's extremely valuable.</font>

1096
01:34:30,621 --> 01:34:32,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, I need blood samples from the raptor.</font>

1097
01:34:33,791 --> 01:34:35,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't just stand there like an idiot!</font>

1098
01:34:35,293 --> 01:34:37,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me 50 ccs carfentanil
and a phlebotomy kit!</font>

1099
01:34:38,045 --> 01:34:39,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's right there! Now!</font>

1100
01:34:40,756 --> 01:34:42,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on.</font>

1101
01:34:43,426 --> 01:34:45,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need this raptor's blood.</font>

1102
01:34:46,637 --> 01:34:48,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, go ahead.</font>

1103
01:34:48,764 --> 01:34:50,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is that kit?</font>

1104
01:34:51,058 --> 01:34:52,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, now listen to me.</font>

1105
01:34:52,852 --> 01:34:54,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is better for you to cooperate.</font>

1106
01:34:54,353 --> 01:34:56,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna get this blood
with or without your help.</font>

1107
01:34:57,106 --> 01:34:58,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This blood's contaminated.</font>

1108
01:34:58,607 --> 01:35:01,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I designed this animal myself.</font>

1109
01:35:01,235 --> 01:35:02,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's pure.</font>

1110
01:35:02,695 --> 01:35:06,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every cell of her body was created
in the most controlled environment</font>

1111
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">under the most demanding of conditions.</font>

1112
01:35:08,868 --> 01:35:11,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but I did an intravenous
blood transfusion with a T. Rex,</font>

1113
01:35:11,912 --> 01:35:13,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so, it's a sock drawer in there.</font>

1114
01:35:13,956 --> 01:35:15,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You what?</font>

1115
01:35:16,584 --> 01:35:18,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Franklin! What are you doing?</font>

1116
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:20,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Saving your life!</font>

1117
01:35:25,092 --> 01:35:26,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

1118
01:35:27,011 --> 01:35:28,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

1119
01:35:30,056 --> 01:35:31,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.</font>

1120
01:35:36,562 --> 01:35:39,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now step away from that cage. Now.</font>

1121
01:35:48,937 --> 01:35:50,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy now.</font>

1122
01:36:15,977 --> 01:36:17,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run. Run!</font>

1123
01:38:19,767 --> 01:38:21,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dave, do you copy? Dave, you there?</font>

1124
01:38:21,769 --> 01:38:22,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>

1125
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:48,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see that?</font>

1126
01:39:49,523 --> 01:39:50,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's hydrogen cyanide.</font>

1127
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:53,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it reaches the containment
level, it'll kill them all.</font>

1128
01:39:55,613 --> 01:39:57,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ventilation system is down.</font>

1129
01:39:57,365 --> 01:39:58,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you bring it back up?</font>

1130
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:34,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The server's unresponsive.
I have to reboot the whole system.</font>

1131
01:40:35,027 --> 01:40:37,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So, reboot it.
- I'm trying.</font>

1132
01:40:53,921 --> 01:40:55,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1133
01:40:57,091 --> 01:40:59,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Franklin, we don't have time.
- I know, I know, I know.</font>

1134
01:40:59,969 --> 01:41:01,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1135
01:41:41,177 --> 01:41:42,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Go.</font>

1136
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:44,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run, run.</font>

1137
01:42:39,276 --> 01:42:41,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Here. You're okay.</font>

1138
01:42:41,387 --> 01:42:44,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put pressure on it. Don't look at it.
Look at me. Look at me.</font>

1139
01:42:44,448 --> 01:42:46,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You have to go find her.
- I can't leave you here.</font>

1140
01:42:50,788 --> 01:42:53,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Go, I'll be fine.</font>

1141
01:42:53,416 --> 01:42:54,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>

1142
01:45:23,691 --> 01:45:25,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maisie, stay down!</font>

1143
01:46:30,132 --> 01:46:32,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me. I know a way on the other side.</font>

1144
01:46:36,055 --> 01:46:37,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1145
01:46:40,184 --> 01:46:41,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

1146
01:46:58,202 --> 01:46:59,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way!</font>

1147
01:47:32,528 --> 01:47:33,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you.</font>

1148
01:47:46,876 --> 01:47:47,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1149
01:48:17,365 --> 01:48:18,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1150
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:44,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

1151
01:49:47,413 --> 01:49:48,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1152
01:49:50,791 --> 01:49:51,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1153
01:49:52,084 --> 01:49:53,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You good?</font>

1154
01:49:55,504 --> 01:49:56,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. You?</font>

1155
01:49:57,089 --> 01:49:58,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope.</font>

1156
01:49:58,591 --> 01:50:00,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, we got a problem downstairs.</font>

1157
01:50:00,343 --> 01:50:01,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to come see this.</font>

1158
01:50:31,874 --> 01:50:33,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're all dying.</font>

1159
01:50:33,376 --> 01:50:35,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The blast damaged the ventilation system.</font>

1160
01:50:35,962 --> 01:50:37,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We did everything we could.</font>

1161
01:50:41,217 --> 01:50:42,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can open the gates from here.</font>

1162
01:50:44,011 --> 01:50:45,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Claire, be careful.</font>

1163
01:50:47,306 --> 01:50:49,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not on an island anymore.</font>

1164
01:51:44,905 --> 01:51:45,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Claire.</font>

1165
01:51:46,365 --> 01:51:48,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You press that button,
there is no going back.</font>

1166
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:56,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't let them die.</font>

1167
01:52:46,342 --> 01:52:47,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to.</font>

1168
01:52:49,011 --> 01:52:52,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're alive, like me.</font>

1169
01:53:24,505 --> 01:53:27,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't! Don't!</font>

1170
01:55:05,815 --> 01:55:07,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, girl.</font>

1171
01:55:07,233 --> 01:55:08,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Owen.</font>

1172
01:55:10,695 --> 01:55:12,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, she won't hurt us.</font>

1173
01:55:34,927 --> 01:55:35,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1174
01:55:44,395 --> 01:55:46,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blue, come with me.</font>

1175
01:55:51,777 --> 01:55:53,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll take you to a safe place, okay?</font>

1176
01:56:35,655 --> 01:56:37,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many times do you have
to see the evidence?</font>

1177
01:56:38,574 --> 01:56:40,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many times must the point be made?</font>

1178
01:56:42,411 --> 01:56:44,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're causing our own extinction.</font>

1179
01:56:45,665 --> 01:56:47,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too many red lines have been crossed.</font>

1180
01:56:49,001 --> 01:56:52,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And our home has,
in fundamental ways, been polluted</font>

1181
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:57,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by avarice and political megalomania.</font>

1182
01:56:58,386 --> 01:57:00,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Genetic power has now been unleashed</font>

1183
01:57:01,263 --> 01:57:03,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and of course, that's gonna be catastrophic.</font>

1184
01:57:04,266 --> 01:57:05,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This change was inevitable</font>

1185
01:57:05,559 --> 01:57:08,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the moment we brought
the first dinosaur back from extinction.</font>

1186
01:57:09,581 --> 01:57:12,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We convince ourselves that sudden change</font>

1187
01:57:12,108 --> 01:57:16,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is something that happens outside the
normal order of things, like a car crash,</font>

1188
01:57:16,988 --> 01:57:19,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or that it's beyond our control,
like a fatal illness.</font>

1189
01:57:19,490 --> 01:57:23,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't conceive of sudden,
radical, irrational change</font>

1190
01:57:23,327 --> 01:57:26,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as woven into the very fabric of existence.</font>

1191
01:57:27,331 --> 01:57:30,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yet, I can assure you, it most assuredly is.</font>

1192
01:57:30,809 --> 01:57:32,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's happening now.</font>

1193
01:57:35,639 --> 01:57:38,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Humans and dinosaurs
are now gonna be forced to co-exist.</font>

1194
01:57:42,930 --> 01:57:45,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These creatures were here before us.</font>

1195
01:57:46,642 --> 01:57:49,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if we're not careful,
they're gonna be here after.</font>

1196
01:57:55,234 --> 01:57:58,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna have to adjust
to new threats that we can't imagine.</font>

1197
01:58:04,994 --> 01:58:06,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've entered a new era.</font>

1198
01:58:08,664 --> 01:58:11,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to Jurassic World.</font>
