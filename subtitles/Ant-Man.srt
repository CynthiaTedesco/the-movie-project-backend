1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,360
Imagine...

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,020
a soldier...

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,240
the size of an insect.

4
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:19,814
The ultimate secret weapon.

5
00:00:21,642 --> 00:00:24,362
If you give God-like powers to everyone?

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,990
It's gonna be chaos.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,860
So how do we stop him?

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,500
I know a guy...

9
00:00:33,588 --> 00:00:34,228
Scott...

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,420
I've been watching you for awhile now.

11
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:39,242
You're different.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,960
And I believe everyone deserves a shot at redemption.

13
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:44,446
Do you?

14
00:00:45,355 --> 00:00:49,835
Absolutely. My days of breaking into places and stealing stuff...

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,300
are OVER.

16
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:53,795
What do you want me to do?

17
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:57,220
I want you to break into a place and steal some stuff.

18
00:00:57,495 --> 00:00:58,375
Makes sense.

19
00:01:00,585 --> 00:01:01,545
Are you ready...

20
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:02,953
to become the hero?

21
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,200
Now, this suit has power.

22
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,940
You have to learn how to control it.

23
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:15,418
And these are your greatest allies.

24
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:16,734
You're kinda cute...

25
00:01:17,223 --> 00:01:17,783
Whoa...

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,880
When you're small, you have super-human strength.

27
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:24,954
You're like a bullet.

28
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,301
So you need to know how to punch.

29
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:30,178
You're gonna show me how to punch?

30
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:30,960
Show me how to pun -

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,960
That's how you punch.

32
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,300
You tried to hide your suit from me.

33
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,060
Now, it's gonna blow up in your face.

34
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:45,859
And destroy everyone you care about.

35
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,800
Scott get out of there!

36
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,840
Did you think you could stop the future?!

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,640
You're just a thief!

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,200
No...

39
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,340
I'm Ant-Man.

40
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,920
I know...

41
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,120
Wasn't my idea.
