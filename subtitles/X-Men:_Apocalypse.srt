96
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out back. With her friends.</font>

97
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did you learn that song, Papa?</font>

98
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I learned it from my parents.</font>

99
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they learned it from their parents.</font>

100
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And them from theirs.</font>

101
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And one day...</font>

102
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'll sing it to your children, too.</font>

103
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to them?</font>

104
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your parents.</font>

105
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were taken from me...</font>

106
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I was a little boy.</font>

107
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they're still here.</font>

108
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Inside.</font>

109
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And here.</font>

110
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With you.</font>

111
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is someone going to take you away?</font>

112
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never.</font>

113
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess we're more alike than we thought.</font>

114
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't listen to us.</font>

115
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's just... He's being...</font>

116

119
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this a school or a museum?</font>

120
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One more. And last one.</font>

121
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go.</font>

122
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you guys.</font>

123
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Watch where you're going.</i></font>

124
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't.</font>

125
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you talking to?</font>

126
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me.</font>

127
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just heard you in my head.</font>

128
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm telepathic. I read minds.</font>

129
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, stay out of mine.</font>

130
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need some weird girl
creeping around in there.</font>

131
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, Scott.
There's not much to see.</font>

132
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, wait.
I didn't tell you my name.</font>

133
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you didn't.</font>

134
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alex Summers?</font>

135
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank McCoy!</font>

136
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! What happened to the
big, blue, furry you'?</font>

137
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I keep him under control now.</font>

138
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my brother, Scott.</font>

139
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Scott. I'm Hank McCoy.
I'm one of the teachers here.</font>

140
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the professor?</font>

00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and a new start made.</font>

143
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Let us now start fresh...</font>

144
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"without remembrance...</font>

145
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:21,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"rather than live forward and backward
at the same time."</font>

146
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, what on earth do we think
that the author meant...</font>

147
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when he wrote all that?</font>

148
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's going to be
your assignment for tomorrow.</font>

149
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Top marks, everyone.
Class dismissed.</font>

150
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:35,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alex.</font>

151
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's good to see you.
- You too.</font>

152
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look well. It's been a while.</font>

153
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It has. Not too bad yourself.</font>

154
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

155
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my brother, Scott.</font>

156
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Scott.
Welcome to the School for the Gifted.</font>

157
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. It doesn't exactly feel like a gift.</font>

158
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It never does, at first.</font>

159
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The first step in
understanding one's power...</font>

160
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is learning the extent of it.</font>

161
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only then can we begin the process
of teaching you how to control it.</font>

162
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you do decide to stay,
I can promise you...</font>

163
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:11,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that by the time you're done here,
you'll be able to go back into the world...</font>

164
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and play a stable and
productive part in it.</font>

165
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you take your bandages off...</font>

166
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we can have a look
at what we're dealing with here?</font>

167
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alex, would you line him up?
Face him in the right direction, as it were.</font>

168
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a target just across the water.</font>

169
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you open your eyes,
try and hit that.</font>

170
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can open your eyes, Scott.</font>

171
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's quite...</font>

172
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look out! Get back!</font>

173
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back! Get back!</font>

174
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My grandfather planted that tree
when he was 5 years old.</font>

175
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to swing...</font>

176
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the branches of it, myself.</font>

177
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that was probably
my favorite tree.</font>

178
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does that mean I'm expelled?</font>

179
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the contrary.</font>

180
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're enrolled.</font>

181
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you sell rugs?</font>

182
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not allowed in this area.</font>

183
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This rug is for sale?</font>

184
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, this...</font>

185
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Earthquake!</font>

186
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back to bed, please, my darling.
Back to bed.</font>

187
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's doing it again.</font>

188
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back to bed, please, everyone.</font>

189
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesse, back to bed, please.</font>

190
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on now. Spit-spot, back to bed.</font>

191
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carrie Anne, come on now. Back to bed.</font>

192
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never seen it like this.</font>

193
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nor I.</font>

194
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let any of the children
come this way.</font>

195
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jean.</font>

196
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jean!</font>

197
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jean!</font>

198
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw the end of the world.</font>

199
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could feel...</font>

200
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all this death.</font>

201
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was just a dream.</font>

202
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it felt real.</font>

203
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

204
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mind is the most powerful
I've ever seen.</font>

205
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:31,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can convince itself...</font>

206
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no...</font>

207
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not just the mind-reading
or the telekinesis...</font>

208
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's something else.</font>

209
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some dark power inside
and it's growing.</font>

210
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a fire.</font>

211
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I was getting better.</font>

212
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:48,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are.</font>

213
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will.</font>

214
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just have to be patient.</font>

215
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. You don't know what it's like
to be afraid to shut your eyes.</font>

216
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be trapped inside your own head.</font>

217
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I think I do.</font>

218
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:04,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't so long ago that
I was plagued by voices, myself.</font>

219
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All their suffering.</font>

220
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:07,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All their pain.</font>

221
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their secrets.</font>

222
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid one day
I'm going to hurt someone.</font>

223
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lie back.</font>

224
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone fears that
which they do not understand.</font>

225
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will learn to control your powers.</font>

226
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when you do...</font>

227
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'll have nothing to fear.</font>

228
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her nightmares were different this time.</font>

229
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could account for something I saw
when I was in my lab earlier.</font>

230
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was some kind of tremor.
Like an energy surge.</font>

231
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I picked it up on one of my meters.</font>

232
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're saying Jean created it?</font>

233
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I'm saying something else did.</font>

234
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe she was reacting to it.
I don't know.</font>

235
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the epicenter was
halfway around the world.</font>

236
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Halfway around the world?</font>

237
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I was hoping you could
take a look.</font>

238
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see what we can find.</font>

239
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Welcome, Professor.</i></font>

240
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, the source came from Cairo.</font>

241
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll put in the coordinates.</font>

242
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I gotta get out of here.</i></font>

243
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:56,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Give them a report.</i></font>

244
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? What is it?</font>

245
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Something happened here.
I can tell them it's real.</i></font>

246
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's her.</font>

247
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:07,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who?</font>

248
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Moira.
- What?</font>

249
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:11,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Moira MacTaggert?</font>

250
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me the details.</font>

251
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She looks amazing.
She's barely aged a day.</font>

252
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I meant...</font>

253
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:19,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is she doing there?</font>

254
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does the CIA want with this?</font>

255
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's going back to Langley
to deliver a report.</font>

256
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:26,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to go there...</font>

257
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">see if she knows something
about the tremor.</font>

258
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you want to go see Moira.</font>

259
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to go check her out.
Check out...</font>

260
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:33,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the situation.</font>

261
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Moira MacTaggert.</font>

262
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a ghost from the past.</font>

263
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did a good thing.
You saved that man.</font>

264
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not the point.</font>

265
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I'm exposed, we're all exposed.</font>

266
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to go.</font>

267
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our home.</font>

268
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our daughter's home.</font>

269
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are her home.</font>

270
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you who I was,
the first night I met you.</font>

271
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I trusted you then.</font>

272
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to trust me now.</font>

273
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't stay here anymore.</font>

274
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get Nina.</font>

275
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweetheart.</font>

276
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not in her room.</font>

277
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't see her out back.</font>

278
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:44,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nina?</font>

279
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nina!</font>

280
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nina!</font>

281
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nina!</font>

282
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nina!</font>

283
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nina.</font>

284
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you alright?</font>

285
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's fine.</font>

286
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then let her go!</font>

287
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will.</font>

288
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just wanted to have a word</font>

289
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not wearing your badges.</font>

290
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No metal.</font>

291
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some guys at the factory said
they saw something today.</font>

292
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something that didn't add up.</font>

293
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your weapons away.</font>

294
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've been a good citizen, Henryk...</font>

295
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A good neighbor... a good worker.</font>

296
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to believe that's who you are.</font>

297
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is.</font>

298
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But nobody in this town really knows you.</font>

299
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes you do.</font>

300
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Henryk Gurzsky.</font>

301
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jakob, I've had dinner in your home...</font>

302
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you were lying the whole time.</font>

303
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I brought a killer into my house.</font>

304
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this you?</font>

305
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you the one they call Magneto?</font>

306
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take me in.</font>

307
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please...</font>

308
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just let my daughter go.</font>

309
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go with your mother.</font>

310
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please...!</font>

311
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't leave me.</font>

312
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going to let them take you.</font>

313
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nina.</font>

314
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:13,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nina.</font>

315
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:15,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nina.</font>

316
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

317
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's one of them?</font>

318
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:22,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell her to stop!</font>

319
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She can't control it!</font>

320
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:26,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's scared of you!</font>

321
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going to let them take you!</font>

322
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make her stop!</font>

323
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nina! Nina!</font>

324
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nina.</font>

325
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nina, Nina, no...</font>

326
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, please. Please!</font>

327
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

328
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

329
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not my babies.</font>

330
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not my babies.</font>

331
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this what you want from me?</font>

332
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this what I am?</font>

333
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this what I am?</font>

334
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what we do to thieves.</font>

335
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pick a hand.</font>

336
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough.</font>

337
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're with her,
I suggest you walk away.</font>

338
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:55,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While you still can.</font>

339
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walk away</font>

340
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:05,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who rules this world?</font>

341
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What language is that?</font>

342
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clown-face. What's the deal?</font>

343
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beat it!</font>

344
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

345
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:40,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't feel it, can you?</font>

346
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:55,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you feel it.</font>

347
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you really haven't seen her
in all these years'?</font>

348
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never looked her up?
Not even in Cerebro?</font>

349
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alex! What do you take me for,
some kind of pervert?</font>

350
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I looked her up once. Twice.</font>

351
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not in a long time, all right?</font>

352
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you leave things?
Any hard feelings?</font>

353
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:19,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not likely.</font>

354
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody take a break.</font>

355
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wiped her mind of all memories of us.</font>

356
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The beach, Cuba...</font>

357
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that whole time.</font>

358
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was so long ago, Alex.</font>

359
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before the world knew about mutants.</font>

360
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:36,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I felt it was the best thing for her.</font>

361
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And for you?</font>

362
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't really matter
what was best for me.</font>

363
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Moira...</font>

364
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MacTaggert, hello!</font>

365
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow me to introduce myself.</font>

366
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm Professor...
- Charles Xavier.</font>

367
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I know exactly who you are.
- You do?</font>

368
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I do.</font>

369
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have read all of your papers.</font>

370
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a pleasure to finally meet you.</font>

371
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Moira MacTaggert.</font>

372
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Alex Summers.
- Have a seat.</font>

373
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just throw that on the floor.</font>

374
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's wonderful to see you again.</font>

375
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To meet you again, for the first time.</font>

376
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:18,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got a son?</font>

377
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

378
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does he have a husband?</font>

379
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have a husband?</font>

380
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a husband...</font>

381
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's hard to do this job
and make it home in time for dinner.</font>

382
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good, good.</font>

383
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all make choices, right?</font>

384
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, we do.</font>

385
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Professor.
- Yes?</font>

386
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

387
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was, we were hoping that you would...</font>

388
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">tell us about what happened
yesterday in Egypt.</font>

389
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid
that's classified information.</font>

390
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't mean to be rude...</font>

391
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but how did you get in here?</font>

392
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have level-5 clearance.</font>

393
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever since the world found out
about mutants in '73...</font>

394
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there have been cults
who see them as some kind of...</font>

395
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Second Coming or sign of God.</font>

396
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was tracking one of them.</font>

397
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:15,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They call themselves Ashir En Sabah Nur...</font>

398
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:18,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">named after an ancient being
they believe to be the world's first.</font>

399
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world's first what?</font>

400
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world's first mutant.</font>

401
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought mutants didn't evolve
until this century.</font>

402
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the common theory, yes,
but these guys believe...</font>

403
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that the first mutant was born
tens of thousands of years ago.</font>

404
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they believe he will rise again.</font>

405
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:35,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've been searching ancient sites
all around the world for clues.</font>

406
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These hieroglyphs...</font>

407
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">describe a specific set of powers
greater than any man could possess.</font>

408
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They think he lived all that time?</font>

409
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes and no.
They believe he had the ability...</font>

410
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to transfer his consciousness
from body to body.</font>

411
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And whenever he was close to death...</font>

412
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he would just take on a new body.</font>

413
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of these may have been
the bodies of mutants...</font>

414
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">enabling him to take their powers...</font>

415
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">amassing various abilities
over the years.</font>

416
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- An all-powerful mutant.

- Yeah. Someone should tell him.</font>

557
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:00,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're still scared of me.</font>

558
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I have special glasses now.</font>

559
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:03,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not scared of you.</font>

560
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're scared of me.</font>

561
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:09,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the only one who
can't fully control your powers.</font>

562
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, so...</font>

563
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">last night, when the house shook...</font>

564
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that was you?</font>

565
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry to break it to you, but you're not
the biggest freak in the school.</font>

566
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's a first.</font>

567
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raven.</font>

568
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

569
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... You're...</font>

570
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not blue?</font>

571
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like you and I
have that in common, now.</font>

572
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, I meant...</font>

573
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're back.</font>

574
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never thought I'd see you here again.</font>

575
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, me neither.</font>

576
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm blue.</font>

577
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Kurt.</font>

578
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, right.</font>

579
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:09,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kurt Wagner.</font>

580
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:11,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome.</font>

581
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're closed.</font>

582
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:21,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew I felt a chill in the air.</font>

583
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:25,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get in here?</font>

584
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We let ourselves in.</font>

585
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are looking for mutants.</font>

586
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:32,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since you know where to find them,
we came here.</font>

587
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Caliban doesn't know you.</font>

588
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're looking for the strongest.</font>

589
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything all right?</font>

590
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:44,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine, Psylocke.</font>

591
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much money do you have?</font>

592
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None.</font>

593
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Caliban said...</font>

594
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:53,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we are closed. Yeah?</font>

595
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need your help, my child.</font>

596
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't look like Caliban's father.</font>

597
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe a little bit up here.</font>

598
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are all my children...</font>

599
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're lost, because you follow
blind leaders.</font>

600
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These false gods...</font>

601
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">systems of the weak.</font>

602
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've ruined my world...</font>

603
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more.</font>

604
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

605
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you...</font>

606
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to feel the full reach of your power.</font>

607
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've only had a taste
of your true strength.</font>

608
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unlike others...</font>

609
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who seek to control you...</font>

610
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to set you free.</font>

611
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know the kind of mutants
you're looking for.</font>

612
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I know where to find them.</font>

613
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It's my first time in America.</i></font>

614
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm very excited to see your culture.</font>

615
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you're not gonna see it here.</font>

616
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only thing American about this place
is that it used to be British.</font>

617
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:37,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Scott.</font>

618
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's new here, too.</font>

619
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm already up for a prison break.</font>

620
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do we say, we take this blue guy
on a little field trip?</font>

621
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure there's a
mall around here, somewhere.</font>

622
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's a mall?</font>

623
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's a mall?</font>

624
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:55,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, now this is a matter of
national pride. Civic duty.</font>

625
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:56,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott.</font>

626
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? You've been cooped up here
for a long time...</font>

627
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the Professor's not even home.</font>

628
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to go to the mall.</font>

629
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try it.</font>

630
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

631
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where does he keep his cars?</font>

632
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:28,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or should I say "piss off"?</font>

633
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:34,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the guy?</font>

634
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He used to be.</font>

635
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know his wings were...</font>

636
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get out of here.</font>

637
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His fighting days are done.</font>

638
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, they're not.</font>

639
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is this?</font>

640
00:53:58,402 --> 00:53:59,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to give you something.</font>

641
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing you can give me
that I want.</font>

642
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, there is.</font>

643
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, my son.</font>

644
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

645
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:52,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rise, my angel.</font>

646
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rise.</font>

647
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:26,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

648
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:32,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hypersonic, blast resistant,
stealth technology.</font>

649
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's impressive.</font>

650
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you ever gonna
get it out of here?</font>

651
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's okay.</font>

652
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I built a retractable roof
into the basketball court.</font>

653
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:45,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank, you're building a warplane
down here.</font>

654
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After what happened in Washington,
I thought we were going to come back...</font>

655
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:51,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and start the X-Men,
like we all used to talk about.</font>

656
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But...</font>

657
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles wants students, not soldiers.</font>

658
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he thinks the best of people.</font>

659
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:57,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has hope.</font>

660
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you?</font>

661
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I think we should
hope for the best.</font>

662
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And prepare for the worst.</font>

663
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think the world needs the X-Men.</font>

664
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:12,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And maybe now that you're back,
you could help me convince him.</font>

665
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:13,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could start it together.</font>

666
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank, I'm here about Erik.</font>

667
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Erik.</font>

668
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:19,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Of course.</font>

669
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:21,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

670
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think he might be
in some kind of trouble.</font>

671
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:24,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Real trouble.</font>

672
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't he always?</font>

673
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of you spoke to the police...</font>

674
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about what you believe
you witnessed here yesterday.</font>

675
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to know my powers...</font>

676
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">know who I am...</font>

677
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">see what I can do?</font>

678
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:23,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll show you.</font>

679
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:29,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think of the person you love most
in your life.</font>

680
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your wife.</font>

681
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:36,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother.</font>

682
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daughter.</font>

683
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:49,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that person will know what it is
to lose someone they love.</font>

684
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And live with that pain.</font>

685
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:55,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forever.</font>

686
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henryk, please.</font>

687
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't do this.</font>

688
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name isn't Henryk.</font>

689
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Magneto.</font>

690
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:29,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the fuck are you?</font>

691
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:34,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay back.</font>

692
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:37,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoever you are...</font>

693
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">don't try to stop me
from killing these men.</font>

694
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not here for them.</font>

695
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here for you.</font>

696
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come and see.</font>

697
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is where your power was born.</font>

698
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:05,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this is where
your people were slaughtered.</font>

699
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shouldn't have brought me here.</font>

700
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

701
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you afraid to be here?</font>

702
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:35,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't escape it, Erik.</font>

703
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

704
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:42,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elohim, Shen, Ra.</font>

705
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:46,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been called many names
over many lifetimes.</font>

706
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am born of death.</font>

707
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:51,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was there to spark...</font>

708
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:55,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and fan the flame of man's awakening.</font>

709
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:57,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To spin the wheel of civilization.</font>

710
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when the forest would grow rank...</font>

711
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and needed clearing for new growth...</font>

712
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:06,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was there to set it ablaze.</font>

713
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where were you...</font>

714
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when my father and mother
were slaughtered in this place?</font>

715
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:12,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asleep.</font>

716
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trapped in darkness.</font>

717
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:18,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was not there for you, my son.</font>

718
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I am here now.</font>

719
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:24,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know your own strength,
but I do.</font>

720
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reach down.</font>

721
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feel the metal...</font>

722
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:33,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the ground.</font>

723
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:36,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reach as deep as you can.</font>

724
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:41,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll find you have the power...</font>

725
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to move the very Earth itself.</font>

726
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:21,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything they've built will fall!</font>

727
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And from the ashes of their world...</font>

728
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:31,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we'll build a better one!</font>

729
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:01,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lehnsherr was identified yesterday,
in this small town in central Poland.</font>

730
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:06,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Leaders from all communities are urging
their citizens to remain calm.</i></font>

731
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:09,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>As police and armed forces
are mobilizing to find Lehnsherr...</i></font>

732
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...before he can strike again.</i></font>

733
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:14,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>If anyone has information
about Lehnsherr...</i></font>

734
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>or as he is also known, Magneto...</i></font>

735
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>contact your local authorities
immediately...</i></font>

736
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and proceed with caution...</i></font>

737
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- as he is considered extremely...
- Peter.</i></font>

738
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up?</font>

739
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:30,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just checking on you.</font>

740
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm good. Playing Pac-Man.</font>

741
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:39,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure you weren't watching this?</font>

742
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:41,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>This news comes at a time when the world
is celebrating 10 years of peace...</i></font>

743
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>between mutants and mankind.</i></font>

744
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going after him, aren't you?</font>

745
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanted me
to get out of the house more, right?</font>

746
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't stop you. Nobody can.</font>

747
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But trust me, this won't end well.</font>

748
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:57,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing does with him.</font>

749
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:03,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not afraid of him.</font>

750
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should be.</font>

751
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:33,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've read so much about this place.</font>

752
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But being here,
it actually seems kind of...</font>

753
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">familiar.</font>

754
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:40,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strange.</font>

755
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quite.</font>

756
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall we?</font>

757
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just saying,
Empire is still the best.</font>

758
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:49,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the most complex,
the most sophisticated...</font>

759
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wasn't afraid to have a dark ending.</font>

760
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but come on.
If it wasn't for the first one...</font>

761
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you wouldn't have any of the rest
of the movies.</font>

762
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:58,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, at least we can all agree,
the third one's always the worst.</font>

763
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank. Are you in here?</font>

764
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like you to meet...</font>

765
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Moira.</font>

766
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raven.</font>

767
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, have we met?</font>

768
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank, Alex, Agent MacTaggert...</font>

769
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would you give us just one moment,
please?</font>

770
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:17,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

771
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles, why didn't she recognize me?
She knew me in this form.</font>

772
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, after you
left me on the beach in Cuba...</font>

773
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:29,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took her memories of that time.
Have a seat.</font>

774
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucky girl.</font>

775
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good to see you, Raven.</font>

776
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Welcome home.
- This isn't my home.</font>

777
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:41,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was once.</font>

778
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it was your home.
I just lived here.</font>

779
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I barely even recognize it now.</font>

780
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:48,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I have plans for this place.</font>

781
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean to turn it into a real campus.</font>

782
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A university.</font>

783
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not just for mutants, either,
for humans too.</font>

784
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Living and working...</font>

785
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">growing together.</font>

786
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I really believed that once.</font>

787
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:05,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really believed we could change them
after DC.</font>

788
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We did.</font>

789
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Charles.
They still hate and fear us.</font>

790
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:12,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just harder to see
because they're more polite about it.</font>

791
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got sick of living that lie.</font>

792
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:16,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why you're not in your
natural blue form.</font>

793
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:19,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna be the face of a world
that doesn't exist.</font>

794
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things are better.
The world is better.</font>

795
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:24,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe in Westchester.</font>

796
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out there, mutants are still running...</font>

797
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hiding, living in fear.</font>

798
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:32,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just because there's not a war,
doesn't mean there's peace.</font>

799
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to teach your kids something,
teach them that.</font>

800
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:36,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Teach them to fight.</font>

801
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise they might as well live
in this house for the rest of their lives.</font>

802
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:40,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still sound just like him.</font>

803
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sound just like Erik.</font>

804
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I'm here.</font>

805
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's resurfaced.</font>

806
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had a wife and a child.</font>

807
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were killed.</font>

808
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:57,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Along with a handful of policemen.</font>

809
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole world will be looking for him.</font>

810
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:05,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can help me find him
before they do.</font>

811
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:16,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Moira, I'm going to have to ask you
to keep this a secret.</font>

812
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:20,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even know what this is.</font>

813
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:21,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Cerebro.</font>

814
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:22,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The new model.</font>

815
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I based the color on...</font>

816
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:27,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it doesn't matter.</font>

817
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are those?</font>

818
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are all the humans of the world.</font>

819
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:53,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And these...</font>

820
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:56,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are all the mutants.</font>

821
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:58,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm connected to all of their minds.</font>

822
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The CIA would kill for this.</font>

823
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:03,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know they would.</font>

824
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you, Erik?</font>

825
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles?</font>

826
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, old friend.</font>

827
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I am so sorry!</font>

828
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel your pain.</font>

829
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:54,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your loss.</font>

830
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:58,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think because you can

gonna do something with his life.</font>

973
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:42,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was always the one.</font>

974
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not how he felt.</font>

975

<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know what he felt?</font>

979
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:04,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what everybody feels.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">How?</font>

987
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can shield their minds
from your power.</font>

988
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:19,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's one of the many gifts I've acquired
throughout the millennia.</font>

989
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:22,600

994
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The glory of what's to come.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it isn't.</font>

999
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:46,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've just forgotten.</font>

1000
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:48,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Charles, I remember.</font>

1001

<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is good in you, too.</font>

1007
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:10,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever it is you think
you saw in me, Charles...</font>

1008
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I buried it...</font>

1009
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:17,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with my family.</font>

1010
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:29,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1011
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:31,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong with you?</font>

1012
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that going to happen
to all of us?</font>

1013
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,880

1016
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:40,468

01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:46,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't get too close to the wall,
if I were you.</font>

1021
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:49,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It may create some discomfort.</i></font>

1022
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Moira MacTaggert.
I'm a senior officer at the CIA.</font>

1025
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:57,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I can.</font>

1029
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:11,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you are going to tell me,
where is Charles Xavier?</font>

1030
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:14,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not him
you should be worried about.</font>

1031
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:17,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's someone else.
Someone more powerful.</font>

1032

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>If you let us out of here,
we can help you.</i></font>

1033
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:25,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really expect me to believe that?</font>

1034
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:28,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You can put on any face that you want,

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What you are.</i></font>

1036
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:36,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Moira.</font>

1037
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you mean when you said...</font>

1038
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:40,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">someone more powerful than Charles?</font>

1039
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:44,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once they finish these,
we'll go from there.</font>

1040
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:52,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's taking so long?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't reach that many people.
I don't have Cerebro.</font>

1054
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:33,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't need a machine...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know him'? Magneto?</font>

1059
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:03,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to.</font>

1060
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:06,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not so sure anymore.</font>

1061
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was he like?</font>

1062
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:11,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was he like they say he was?
Was he...</font>

1063

<font face="Comic Sans MS">the bad guy?</font>

1064
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:15,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1065
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:19,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, yeah. He was...</font>

1066
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:24,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you care so much?
You see his speech on TV or something?</font>

1067
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:27,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but...</font>

1068
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:33,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's my father.</font>

1069
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:34,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1070
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:36,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Him and my mom, they did it.
- No, I know...</font>

1071
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:38,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure?</font>

1072
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:41,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. He left my mom before I was born.</font>

1073
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:42,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I met him 10 years back...</font>

1074
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,327

it was too late.</font>

1076

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, this week I saw him on TV again...</font>

1077
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:52,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I came to that house,

1083
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:09,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will reach down, my son.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I to play a role in this madness?</font>

1196
01:40:32,735 --> 01:40:36,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have the most important role of all.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">That day in D.C., were you scared?</font>

1199
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:53,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1200
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:01,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I was scared on my first mission.</font>

1201
01:41:02,265 --> 01:41:04,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was on a plane like this
with my friends.</font>

1202
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:06,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About your age.</font>

1203
01:41:09,689 --> 01:41:11,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We called ourselves the X-Men.</font>

1204
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:14,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your brother was there.</font>

1205
01:41:15,444 --> 01:41:16,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We used to call him Havok.</font>

1206
01:41:17,363 --> 01:41:19,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a real handful...</font>

1207
01:41:21,242 --> 01:41:23,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but when it came down to it,
he was very brave.</font>

1208
01:41:26,163 --> 01:41:28,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to the rest of the kids
who went with you?</font>

1209
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The X-Men?</font>

1210
01:41:32,962 --> 01:41:34,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank and I are the only ones left.</font>

1211
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:37,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't save the rest of them.</font>

1212
01:41:38,718 --> 01:41:40,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you, I'm not a hero.</font>

1213
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:43,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you're a hero to us.</font>

1214
01:41:43,806 --> 01:41:45,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seeing you that day on</font>

1215
01:41:45,725 --> 01:41:46,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">changed my life.</font>

1216
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:48,610

1218
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:56,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still live in my mom's basement
but, you know...</font>

1219
01:41:56,235 --> 01:41:57,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">everything else is...</font>

1220
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:01,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's pretty much the same.</font>

1221
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:04,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a total loser.</font>

1222
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:07,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What we're seeing is
a magnetic phenomenon...</font>

1223
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:10,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on a much larger scale
than what we saw at Auschwitz.</font>

1224
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:12,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ground is full of magnetic elements.</font>

1225
01:43:12,895 --> 01:43:14,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iron, nickel, cobalt.</font>

1226
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:17,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ocean's floor
is lined with them, too.</font>

1227
01:43:17,233 --> 01:43:19,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's already begun at the lowest depths.</font>

1228
01:43:20,069 --> 01:43:23,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Land masses will slow it,
but not for long.</font>

1229
01:43:23,364 --> 01:43:26,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eventually, cities, urban centers...</font>

1230
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:28,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">anything built since the Bronze Age...</font>

1231
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:30,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will be wiped away.</font>

1232
01:43:30,246 --> 01:43:31,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The death toll will be in the billions.</font>

the whole goddamn world.</font>

1234
01:44:23,549 --> 01:44:24,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're just another false god.</font>

1235
01:44:25,843 --> 01:44:28,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And whoever's left to follow you
when this all over...</font>

1236
01:44:28,304 --> 01:44:31,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they will betray you again.</font>

1237
01:44:33,601 --> 01:44:35,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're wrong, Charles.</font>

1238
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:39,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the first time
in a thousand lifetimes...</font>

1239
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:41,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have you.</font>

1240
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:47,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For all my gifts, I have yet
to possess the one I needed most.</font>

1241
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:49,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be...</font>

1242
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:51,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">everywhere.</font>

1243
01:44:54,872 --> 01:44:56,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be...</font>

1244
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">everyone.</font>

1245
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:15,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7th wonder, 12 0'clock.</font>

1246
01:45:24,068 --> 01:45:26,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has the Professor
in the center of the pyramid.</font>

1247
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:30,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going to transfer his consciousness
into the Professor.</font>

1248
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:31,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he does that...</font>

1249
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:35,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he'll have the power
to control every mind in the world.</font>

1250
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:44,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is that?</font>

1251
01:45:45,256 --> 01:45:46,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Erik.</font>

1252
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:58,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys help Nightcrawler
get into the pyramid.</font>

1253
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:02,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get Charles. I'll take care of Erik.</font>

1254
01:46:02,982 --> 01:46:04,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are we gonna get through that?</font>

1255
01:46:05,609 --> 01:46:06,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can get you in there.</font>

1256
01:46:07,444 --> 01:46:08,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I came here for him. Let me help you.</font>

1257
01:46:10,364 --> 01:46:13,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The rest of you, get Charles on this
plane and get him out of here.</font>

1258
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:14,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're not leaving without you!
- Don't worry.</font>

1259
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:16,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll catch up.</font>

1260
01:46:16,954 --> 01:46:18,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on.</font>

1261
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:49,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank, you go with the kids.</font>

1262
01:46:50,029 --> 01:46:52,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Moira will be waiting on the plane.
- Wait.</font>

1263
01:46:52,656 --> 01:46:53,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1264
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not all of us can
fully control our powers.</font>

1265
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:58,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then don't.</font>

1266
01:46:58,329 --> 01:47:00,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to embrace them.</font>

1267
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:04,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all do.</font>

1268
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:31,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Join the others.</font>

1269
01:47:31,528 --> 01:47:34,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Protect me,
until the transference is complete.</font>

1270
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:01,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's an entrance. It's clear.</font>

1271
01:48:05,729 --> 01:48:07,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kurt! Get in there!</font>

1272
01:48:18,242 --> 01:48:19,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the pyramid! Move!</font>

1273
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:21,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

1274
01:48:57,823 --> 01:48:58,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Split them up.</font>

1275
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:23,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor...</font>

1276
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:28,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kurt, you have to hurry!</font>

1277
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:31,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying. It's like a maze in here.</font>

1278
01:49:41,492 --> 01:49:42,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kurt, no!</font>

1279
01:50:08,018 --> 01:50:10,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The magnetic field is too strong.
I can't get us in there.</font>

1280
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:13,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Erik!</font>

1281
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:22,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mystique.</font>

1282
01:50:26,537 --> 01:50:29,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you think you've lost everything.</font>

1283
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:31,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you haven't.</font>

1284
01:50:33,293 --> 01:50:35,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have me.</font>

1285
01:50:35,712 --> 01:50:37,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have Charles.</font>

1286
01:50:43,554 --> 01:50:46,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have more family than you know.</font>

1287
01:50:47,391 --> 01:50:50,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never had the chance
to save your family before.</font>

1288
01:50:51,228 --> 01:50:52,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you do now.</font>

1289
01:50:55,566 --> 01:50:58,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I've come here to tell you.</font>

1290
01:51:03,448 --> 01:51:05,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you?</font>

1291
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:15,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm your...</font>

1292
01:51:19,923 --> 01:51:22,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here for my family, too.</font>

1293
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:13,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out. Get out!</font>

1294
01:52:13,518 --> 01:52:14,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out!</font>

1295
01:52:21,693 --> 01:52:23,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i></font>

1296
01:52:34,748 --> 01:52:36,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're losing him.</font>

1297
01:52:52,349 --> 01:52:53,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be right back.</font>

1298
01:53:04,403 --> 01:53:05,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott, glasses on!</font>

1299
01:53:15,706 --> 01:53:16,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>

1300
01:53:33,557 --> 01:53:35,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Locked on.
- Here we go.</font>

1301
01:53:52,909 --> 01:53:54,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Psylocke!</font>

1302
01:54:10,427 --> 01:54:11,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell was that?</font>

1303
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:19,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kurt.</font>

1304
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:21,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone, grab hold of Nightcrawler!</font>

1305
01:54:21,271 --> 01:54:22,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never done it
with this many people.</font>

1306
01:54:22,773 --> 01:54:23,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get us out of here.</font>

1307
01:54:39,623 --> 01:54:40,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kurt, hurry!</font>

1308
01:54:42,376 --> 01:54:43,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kurt!</font>

1309
01:55:09,403 --> 01:55:10,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles...</font>

1310
01:55:16,326 --> 01:55:17,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he okay?</font>

1311
01:55:17,828 --> 01:55:20,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's his energy. He's drained.</font>

1312
01:55:21,498 --> 01:55:22,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out.</font>

1313
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:24,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out!</font>

1314
01:55:24,501 --> 01:55:26,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor, it's okay.
You're with us.</font>

1315
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:29,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1316
01:55:38,014 --> 01:55:40,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to fight
for what I have left.</font>

1317
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:45,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you?</font>

1318
01:55:58,827 --> 01:56:01,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's so much more to you
than you know.</font>

1319
01:56:01,496 --> 01:56:04,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not just pain and anger.</font>

1320
01:56:04,624 --> 01:56:06,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's good, too. I felt it.</font>

1321
01:56:07,002 --> 01:56:08,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not just me
you're walking away from.</font>

1322
01:56:09,045 --> 01:56:13,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, you have the chance to be a part of
something much bigger than yourself.</font>

1323
01:56:13,383 --> 01:56:16,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it needs you, Erik.</font>

1324
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:47,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Useless.</font>

1325
01:56:52,506 --> 01:56:53,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Charles.</i></font>

1326
01:56:56,092 --> 01:56:58,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you can hear me.</font>

1327
01:56:59,095 --> 01:57:02,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're still connected.</font>

1328
01:57:05,894 --> 01:57:06,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles!</font>

1329
01:57:08,021 --> 01:57:09,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show yourself!</font>

1330
01:57:11,066 --> 01:57:12,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles!</font>

1331
01:57:13,401 --> 01:57:15,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show yourself!</font>

1332
01:57:45,225 --> 01:57:47,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Foolish child.</font>

1333
01:57:55,777 --> 01:57:56,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter.</font>

1334
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:14,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">End him.</font>

1335
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:42,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raven.</font>

1336
01:58:50,832 --> 01:58:52,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The great hero.</font>

1337
01:58:57,297 --> 01:58:59,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm going out there.
- I'm going with you.</font>

1338
01:58:59,674 --> 01:59:00,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1339
01:59:02,093 --> 01:59:03,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me he wants.</font>

1340
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:04,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles, you can't give yourself up.</font>

1341
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:07,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he has you, he has us all.</font>

1342
01:59:07,223 --> 01:59:08,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole world.</font>

1343
01:59:09,017 --> 01:59:10,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are feeble.</font>

1344
01:59:10,935 --> 01:59:11,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like the others.</font>

1345
01:59:13,188 --> 01:59:14,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles!</font>

1346
01:59:14,356 --> 01:59:15,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come!</font>

1347
01:59:15,357 --> 01:59:16,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rescue your weaklings!</font>

1348
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:20,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give your life for theirs!</font>

1349
01:59:22,238 --> 01:59:23,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was right.</font>

1351
01:59:33,541 --> 01:59:36,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is still some part of me
connected to him.</font>

1352
01:59:37,003 --> 01:59:37,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles!</font>

1353
01:59:37,962 --> 01:59:39,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can get inside his head.</font>

1354
01:59:39,714 --> 01:59:41,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you do nothing?</font>

1355
01:59:43,051 --> 01:59:44,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for letting me in.</font>

1356
02:00:02,946 --> 02:00:04,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want what I have?</font>

1357
02:00:04,656 --> 02:00:06,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to feel what I feel?</font>

1360
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:36,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll need a bigger house.</font>

1361
02:01:55,475 --> 02:01:57,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You betray me?</font>

1362
02:01:57,227 --> 02:01:58,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1363
02:01:59,145 --> 02:02:00,647

1365
02:02:30,176 --> 02:02:31,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1366
02:02:36,432 --> 02:02:37,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover me.</font>

1367
02:02:39,894 --> 02:02:41,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you.</font>

1368
02:02:46,568 --> 02:02:47,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

1369
02:03:09,048 --> 02:03:11,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They lack strength, Charles.</font>

1380
02:04:40,932 --> 02:04:43,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's over, Charles.
You're finished.</font>

1381
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:45,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're mine now.</font>

1382
02:04:48,064 --> 02:04:50,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will never win.</font>

1383
02:04:51,192 --> 02:04:53,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And why is that?</font>

1384
02:04:53,277 --> 02:04:55,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you are alone.</font>

1385
02:04:57,281 --> 02:05:00,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I am not!</font>

1386
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:13,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Let...</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">go.</font>

1388
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Unleash your power, Jean.</i></font>

1389
02:05:19,554 --> 02:05:20,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No fear.</font>

1390
02:06:08,978 --> 02:06:11,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unleash your power!</font>

1391
02:06:11,647 --> 02:06:13,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let go, Jean!</font>

1392
02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:15,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jean, let go!</font>

1393
02:06:51,604 --> 02:06:53,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's getting away.</font>

1394
02:07:10,748 --> 02:07:14,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All is revealed.</font>

1395
02:08:16,189 --> 02:08:17,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles! Charles!</font>

1396
02:08:19,442 --> 02:08:20,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We've lost him!
- Charles.</font>

1397
02:08:20,610 --> 02:08:22,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's gone.
- No, Charles.</font>

1398
02:08:22,445 --> 02:08:23,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles...</font>

1399
02:08:23,946 --> 02:08:25,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he's not.</font>

1400
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:27,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can still feel him.</font>

1401
02:08:51,974 --> 02:08:53,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Jean.</font>

1402
02:08:55,728 --> 02:08:56,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles?</font>

1403
02:08:57,730 --> 02:08:59,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles, do you know where you are?</font>

1404
02:09:02,818 --> 02:09:04,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm on a beach.</font>

1405
02:09:10,576 --> 02:09:12,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In Cuba.</font>

1406
02:09:13,996 --> 02:09:15,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With you.</font>

1407
02:09:15,831 --> 02:09:17,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What beach?</font>

1408
02:09:24,882 --> 02:09:25,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles Xavier.</font>

1409
02:09:52,785 --> 02:09:53,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1410
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:57,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should never have taken those
from you.</font>

1411
02:10:00,626 --> 02:10:01,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on!</font>

1412
02:10:06,757 --> 02:10:08,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did I miss?</font>

1413
02:10:10,928 --> 02:10:13,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It seems only by the grace of God...</i></font>

1414
02:10:13,556 --> 02:10:14,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>that the ominous destruction...</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>seen from one end of the globe
to the other, has stopped.</i></font>

1416
02:10:17,935 --> 02:10:20,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>At a debriefing today,
CIA Special Agent Moira MacTaggert...</i></font>

1417

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>revealed to an investigative
committee...</i></font>

1418
02:10:22,815 --> 02:10:25,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The committee was further stunned

1420
02:10:28,321 --> 02:10:30,665

1421
02:10:31,407 --> 02:10:32,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Mr. President.</font>

and debate...</i></font>

1424
02:10:36,912 --> 02:10:40,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>at a time when mutants were becoming
accepted around the world.</i></font>

1425
02:11:07,777 --> 02:11:10,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mystique told me he is your father.</font>

1426
02:11:11,322 --> 02:11:13,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you gonna tell him?</font>

1427
02:11:14,617 --> 02:11:15,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I might...</font>

1428
02:11:16,535 --> 02:11:17,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one day.</font>

1429
02:11:19,288 --> 02:11:22,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think for now, I'm just gonna
stick around here for a while.</font>

1430

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, too.</font>

1431
02:11:40,226 --> 02:11:43,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world's already begun
rebuilding its arsenals.</font>

1432
02:11:43,854 --> 02:11:46,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's human nature, Charles.</font>

1433
02:11:47,858 --> 02:11:49,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still have hope.</font>

1434
02:11:50,486 --> 02:11:51,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes.</font>

1435
02:11:52,905 --> 02:11:53,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hope."</font>

1436
02:11:54,824 --> 02:11:56,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was right about Raven.</font>

1437
02:11:57,410 --> 02:11:59,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was even right about you.</font>

1438
02:12:02,581 --> 02:12:04,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the rest of the world?</font>

1439
02:12:06,001 --> 02:12:08,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't it ever wake you up
in the middle of the night?</font>

1440
02:12:10,881 --> 02:12:13,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The feeling that one day
they'll come for you...</font>

1441

1443
02:12:19,515 --> 02:12:22,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you do when you wake up to that?</font>

1444
02:12:23,561 --> 02:12:26,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel a great swell of pity
for the poor soul...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're psychic, Charles.</font>

1448
02:12:40,703 --> 02:12:42,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can convince me to do anything.</font>

1449
02:12:45,374 --> 02:12:47,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye, old friend.</font>

1450
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:49,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck, Professor.</font>

1451
02:12:54,967 --> 02:12:56,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forget everything you think you know.</font>

1452
02:12:58,387 --> 02:13:00,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever lessons you learned
in school...</font>

1453
02:13:02,141 --> 02:13:04,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whatever your parents taught you.</font>

1454
02:13:05,561 --> 02:13:08,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of that matters!</font>

1455
02:13:09,899 --> 02:13:11,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not kids anymore.</font>

1456
02:13:12,318 --> 02:13:13,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not students.</font>

1457
02:13:18,073 --> 02:13:19,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're X-Men.</font>
