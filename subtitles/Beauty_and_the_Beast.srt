00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:41,460
<i>Once upon a time in the hidden heart
of France.</i>

2
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,481
<i>A handsome young prince</i>

3
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:46,481
<i>lived in a beautiful castle.</i>

4
00:00:48,546 --> 00:00:49,546
<i>Puff! Puff!</i>

5
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,736
<i>Although he had everything
his heart desired,</i>

6
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:55,495
<i>the Prince was selfish and unkind.</i>

7
00:00:55,902 --> 00:00:57,783
Master, it's time.

8
00:00:58,023 --> 00:00:59,263
<i>He taxed the village</i>

9
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,369
<i>to fill his castle with the most
beautiful objects.</i>

10
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:07,103
<i>And his parties with the most
beautiful people.</i>

11
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:31,736
<i>Oh, how defined</i>

12
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,873
<i>Glamour music and magic combined</i>

13
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:39,258
<i>See the maidens for anxious to shine</i>

14
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:44,939
<i>Look for a sign that in the hands,
chances,</i>

15
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:47,872
<i>She'll be his special one</i>

16
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:50,045
<i>What a play</i>

17
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,649
<i>What a breathtaking, thrilling array</i>

18
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,588
<i>Every prince, every has a day</i>

19
00:01:56,946 --> 00:02:00,948
<i>As I sing with passion, gusto...</i>

<i>***</i>

21
00:02:13,193 --> 00:02:14,296
<i>Then one night,</i>

22
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:17,379
<i>an unexpected intruder arrived
at the castle,</i>

23
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:20,918
<i>seeking shelter from the
bestest storm.</i>

24
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:24,819
<i>As a gift, she offered
the Prince a single rose.</i>

25
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:33,095
<i>Repulsed by her haggard
appearance,</i>

26
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:36,010
<i>the Prince turned the woman away.</i>

27
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:42,995
<i>But she warned him not to be deceived
by appearances.</i>

28
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:50,518
<i>For beauty is found within.</i>

29
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:54,343
<i>When he dismissed her again,</i>

30
00:02:54,678 --> 00:02:56,854
<i>the old woman's out with her appearance
melted away.</i>

31
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:02,079
<i>To reveal...</i>

32
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:04,999
<i>a beautiful enchantress.</i>

33
00:03:12,284 --> 00:03:15,929
<i>The Prince begged for forgiveness,
but he was too late.</i>

34
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,899
<i>Cause she had seen that there was no love
in his heart.</i>

35
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,940
Chip! Chip! Oh, Lord!

36
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:27,563
<i>As punishment...</i>

37
00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:32,601
<i>she transformed him into
a hideous beast.</i>

38
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:35,622
<i>And placed a powerfull spell
on the castle...</i>

39
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:37,403
<i>and all who lived there.</i>

40
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:45,678
<i>As days bleed into years...</i>

41
00:03:45,974 --> 00:03:49,183
<i>The Prince and his servants
were forgotten by the world.</i>

42
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,966
<i>For the enchantress had erased
all memory of them,</i>

43
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:55,444
<i>from the minds of the people
they loved.</i>

44
00:03:55,732 --> 00:04:00,186
<i>But the rose she had offered was truly
an enchanted rose.</i>

45
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:02,432
<i>If he could learn to love another...</i>

46
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:06,380
<i>and earned their love in return
by the time the last petal fell,</i>

47
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:09,160
<i>the spell would be broken.</i>

48
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:14,996
<i>If not, he would be doomed to remain
a beast for all time.</i>

49
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:17,658
<i>As the years passed,</i>

50
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,759
<i>he fell into despair and lost
all hope.</i>

51
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,913
<i>For who could ever learn to love
a beast?</i>

<i>Everyday, like the one before</i>

<i>Waking up to say..­</i>

58
00:05:18,582 --> 00:05:19,582
Bonjour.

Bonjour.

60
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:21,616
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

61
00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:22,657
<i>Morning.</i>

62
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:26,317
<i>There goes the baker
with his tray, like always</i>

63
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:29,524
<i>The same all bread and rolls
to sell</i>

64
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:31,529
<i>Every morning just the same</i>

65
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,022
<i>Since the morning that we came
to this poor provincial town.</i>

66
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:36,529
Good morning, Belle!

67
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,420
Good morning Monsieur Jean!
Have you lost something again?

68
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,584
Well, I believe I have.
The problem is, I can't remember what!

69
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:45,441
I'm sure it'll come through me.

70
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:47,522
Where are you off to?

71
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:50,172
To return this book to
Père Robert.

72
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:52,122
It's about two lovers in fair Verona.

73
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,620
Sounds boring.

74
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:58,104
<i>Look there she goes that girl is strange,
no question</i>

75
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:00,390
<i>Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?</i>

76
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:05,456
<i>Never part of any crowd</i>

77
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:07,343
<i>'Cause her head's up on some cloud</i>

78
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:11,079
<i>No denying she's a funny girl that Belle</i>

79
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:15,545
<i>Bonjour, good day!
How is your family?</i>

80
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:18,812
<i>Bonjour, good day!
How is your wife?</i>

81
00:06:19,723 --> 00:06:22,851
<i>I need six eggs,
that's too expensive.</i>

82
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:27,909
<i>There must be more than
this provincial life.</i>

83
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,945
Ah! If it isn't the only bookworm
in town!

84
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:35,928
So, where did you run off to
this week?

85
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:37,627
Two cities in northern Italy.

86
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:39,298
I didn't want to come back.

87
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:41,168
Have you got any new places to go?

88
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:42,527
I'm afraid not.

89
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,715
But you may re-read any
of the old ones that you'd like.

90
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,950
Thank you.

91
00:06:47,468 --> 00:06:50,036
Your library makes a small corner of the wall
seems big.

92
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,230
- Bon voyage.
- Bye.

93
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,510
<i>Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar</i>

94
00:06:57,832 --> 00:07:00,182
<i>I wonder if she's feeling well?</i>

95
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,771
<i>With a dreamy far-off look
and her nose stuck in a book.</i>

96
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,373
<i>What a puzzle to the rest of us
is Belle.</i>

97
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:15,088
<i>Ah~ isn't this amazing?</i>

98
00:07:15,388 --> 00:07:21,275
<i>it's my favorite parts, because</i>

99
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:22,475
<i>you'll see..</i>

100
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:29,834
<i>Here's where she meets Prince Charming</i>

101
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:36,717
<i>But she won't discover that it's him,
'til chapter three</i>

102
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,471
<i>Now it's no wonder that her name
means "beauty"</i>

103
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:47,136
<i>Her looks have got no parallel</i>

104
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:50,978
<i>But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd</i>

105
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,930
<i>Very different from the rest of us</i>

106
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:54,906
<i>She's nothing like the rest of us</i>

107
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:59,119
<i>She's different from the rest of us
is Belle</i>

108
00:08:03,994 --> 00:08:05,320
Look at her, LeFou.

109
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:08,186
My future wife.

110
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:11,627
Belle is the most beautiful girl
in the village.

111
00:08:11,996 --> 00:08:13,454
That makes her the best.

112
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:15,606
But she's so well-read.

113
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:17,622
And you so..

114
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:19,283
athletically inclined.

115
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:20,642
I know.

116
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,097
Belle can be as argumentative
as she's beautiful.

117
00:08:23,422 --> 00:08:25,829
Exactly! Who needs her, when you've
got us?

118
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:27,493
Yes..

119
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:31,264
Ever since the war, I felt like,
I've been missing someting.

120
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:33,859
And she is the only girl
who gives me that sense of...

121
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:38,020
I don't know what that means.

122
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:42,032
<i>Right from the moment when
I met her, saw her.</i>

123
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:45,921
<i>I said, "she's gorgeous"
and I fell</i>

124
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:50,246
<i>Here in town there's only she,
who is beautiful as me.</i>

125
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:53,964
<i>So I making plan to woo
and marry Belle.</i>

126
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:55,646
<i>Look there he goes.</i>

127
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:57,932
<i>Isn't he dreamy?</i>

128
00:08:58,342 --> 00:09:01,535
<i>Monsieur Gaston, oh!
He's so cute!</i>

129
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:05,248
<i>Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing</i>

130
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:10,150
<i>He's such a tall, dark, strong and
handsome brute</i>

131
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:18,693
That's never gonna happen, ladies.

132
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,450
<i>- Bonjour!
- Pardon!</i>

133
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:25,608
<i>- Good day!
- Mais oui!</i>

134
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:27,171
<i>- You call this bacon?
- What lovely grapes!</i>

135
00:09:27,471 --> 00:09:28,471
<i>- Some cheese­
- Ten yards</i>

136
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
<i>- One pound
- Excuse me</i>

137
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,104
<i>- I'll get the knife
- Please, let me through!</i>

138
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:32,376
<i>- This bread
- Those fish</i>

139
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:33,501
<i>- It's stale!
- They smell</i>

140
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:34,988
<i>Madame's mistaken</i>

141
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:38,313
<i>There must be more than this provincial life!</i>

142
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:42,388
<i>Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!</i>

143
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:46,176
<i>Look there she goes a girl who's strange
but special</i>

144
00:09:46,572 --> 00:09:49,529
<i>A most peculiar mad'moiselle</i>

145
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,424
<i>It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in</i>

146
00:09:53,698 --> 00:09:57,250
<i>'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl</i>

147
00:09:57,576 --> 00:10:02,406
<i>She really is a funny girl!</i>

148
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:07,405
<i>That Belle~</i>

149
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:09,057
Good morrning, Belle!

150
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:12,007
Wonderful book you have there!

151
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,967
Have you read it?

152
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:18,205
Well, not that one. But, you know, books...

153
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:20,103
For your dinner table.

154
00:10:20,478 --> 00:10:21,759
Shall I join you this evening?

155
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,443
Sorry, not this evening.

156
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,000
Busy?

157
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:28,729
No...

158
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,660
So, moving on?

159
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,094
No, LeFou.

160
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,945
It's the ones who play hard to get
that are always the sweetest prey.

161
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:41,961
That what makes Belle so appealing.

162
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,121
She hasn't made a fool of herself
just to gain my favour.

163
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:46,981
How would you call that?

164
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:48,261
Dignity?

165
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:50,391
It's outrageously attractive, isn't it?

166
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:51,657
Gaston!

167
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,799
<i>How does a moment last forever?</i>

168
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:28,708
<i>How can a story never died?</i>

169
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:33,591
<i>It is love we must hold onto.</i>

170
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,874
<i>Never easy, but we try.</i>

171
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:43,321
<i>Sometimes our happiness is captured.</i>

172
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,600
<i>Somehow a time and place stand still.</i>

173
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:54,831
<i>Love leads on inside our hearts.</i>

174
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,702
<i>And always will.</i>

175
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,270
Oh, Belle!

176
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,102
Could you..?

177
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:09,471
Hand me a...

178
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:13,910
Thank you.

179
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:16,967
And I also need..

180
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:19,394
No. No.

181
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,650
Actually...

182
00:12:21,814 --> 00:12:24,098
Yes, that's exactly what I need.
Thank you.

183
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:37,601
Papa, do you think I'm odd?

184
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Odd?

185
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:42,021
My daughter? Odd?

186
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:43,777
Where did you get an idea
like that?

187
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:46,776
I don't know. People talk.

188
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:49,177
This is a small village, you know.

189
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:51,494
Small minded, as well.

190
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,364
But, small also means safe.

191
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:59,965
Even back in Paris, I knew a girl like you,
who would be so...

192
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:02,600
ahead of a time.

193
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,475
Different.

194
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:06,357
People mocked her.

195
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:11,770
Until the day they all found themselves
imitating her.

196
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:21,375
Please, just tell me one more thing
about her.

197
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:27,802
Your mother was..

198
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,984
fearless.

199
00:13:33,884 --> 00:13:35,245
Fearless.

200
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:55,922
So,

201
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,475
what can I bring you from the market?

202
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,187
A rose. Like the one
in the painting.

203
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:03,166
You ask of that every year!

204
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:04,773
And every year you bring it.

205
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:06,459
Then I should bring you another.

206
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:09,059
You have my word.

207
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,267
Bye, Papa.

208
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:12,790
Bye, Belle.

209
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,102
Come on, Philippe.

210
00:14:15,578 --> 00:14:16,578
You know the way.

211
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:17,767
I'll see you tomorrow!

212
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:21,135
Right!
Tomorrow, with the rose!

213
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,091
Stay safe.

214
00:15:08,535 --> 00:15:10,117
What are you doing?

215
00:15:11,221 --> 00:15:12,221
The laundry.

216
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:16,151
Come! Come!

217
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:22,885
"The Blue Bird.."

218
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:23,935
The Blue Bird

219
00:15:24,134 --> 00:15:26,396
"that flies over..."

220
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:29,646
"the dark..."

221
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:31,229
"wood".

222
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:32,500
That was amazing!

223
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,949
What on earth are you doing?

224
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,276
Teaching another girl to read?

225
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,532
Isn't one enough?

226
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:42,518
We have to do something.

227
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,342
You are the wildest,

228
00:15:56,703 --> 00:15:59,337
most gorgeous thing
I've ever seen.

229
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:01,147
Nobody deserves you.

230
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,061
But at least I know our children
will be beautiful.

231
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:06,357
Am I catching you at a bad time?

232
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:09,380
- What is it, LeFou?
- A damsel is in distress.

233
00:16:12,503 --> 00:16:14,616
It's hero time.

234
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:17,255
I'm not done with you, yet.

235
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:21,025
Me, neither.

236
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:24,463
Belle! I heard you had trouble
with the headmaster.

237
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:25,937
He never liked me either.

238
00:16:27,128 --> 00:16:30,028
Can I give you a little advise
about the villagers, Belle?

239
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:33,308
They're never gonna trust the kind of change
you're trying to bring them.

240
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,055
All I wanted was to teach a child
to read.

241
00:16:37,398 --> 00:16:39,607
The only children you should concern
yourself, will be..

242
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:41,597
your own.

243
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:43,969
I'm...

244
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:46,108
not ready to have children.

245
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,985
Maybe you haven't met the right man.

246
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,111
It's a small village, Gaston.
I've met them all.

247
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,672
Well, maybe you should take
another look.

248
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,563
Some of us have changed.

249
00:16:56,986 --> 00:16:57,986
Gaston,

250
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:00,037
we could never make each other happy.

251
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:02,935
No one can changed that much.

252
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:04,368
Oh, Belle.

253
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:09,033
Do you know what happens to spinsters in this village
after their fathers died?

254
00:17:09,246 --> 00:17:10,968
Coins? Could you spare me coins?

255
00:17:11,234 --> 00:17:13,893
They beg for scraps,
like poor Agathe.

256
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:16,711
This is our world, Belle.

257
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,869
For simple folk like us,
it doesn't getting better.

258
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:21,925
I want to be a farm girl.

259
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:24,385
But I'm not simple.
And..

260
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:28,385
I'm never going to marry you, Gaston.

261
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:29,641
I'm sorry!

262
00:17:46,103 --> 00:17:47,388
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

263
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:50,518
<i>Me? The wife of that boorish,</i>

264
00:17:50,787 --> 00:17:51,787
<i>brainless...</i>

265
00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:56,131
<i>Madam Gaston, can't you just see it?</i>

266
00:17:56,469 --> 00:18:00,137
<i>Madame Gaston, his little wife. Ugh!</i>

267
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:03,311
<i>No, Sir. Not me, I guarantee it</i>

268
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:07,389
<i>I want much more than this
provincial life</i>

269
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:22,777
<i>I want adventure in the great wide
somewhere</i>

270
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:27,743
<i>I want it more than I can tell</i>

271
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:32,832
<i>And for once it might be grand</i>

272
00:18:33,843 --> 00:18:37,555
<i>To have someone understand</i>

273
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:44,852
I want so much more than they've got planned

274
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:00,063
The woods are lovely.

275
00:19:00,427 --> 00:19:02,823
I only wish I'd recognized them.

276
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:06,226
You know where we are, Philippe?
Cause I don't.

277
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:14,136
It's all right. It's all right. Philippe.

278
00:19:18,698 --> 00:19:19,917
Yes, we can go this way.

279
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,664
Go on. To the right.

280
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,557
That's it!

281
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,175
Come on!

282
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:28,717
One door closes,

283
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:29,989
another one opens.

284
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:34,131
All right, boy.
Just a bit of snow.

285
00:19:34,668 --> 00:19:36,081
In June.

286
00:19:37,257 --> 00:19:38,297
Mind your step.

287
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:40,348
It's slippery.

288
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:53,616
Go, go Philippe! Come on!

289
00:20:01,894 --> 00:20:03,183
Come on!

290
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:05,557
Go, Philippe! Go!

291
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,612
Philippe!

292
00:20:41,302 --> 00:20:42,581
Good boy.

293
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:46,842
Go, boy! Go!

294
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:02,047
Philippe, you saved my life!

295
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:04,814
Well done. Ehh.

296
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:10,024
They'll have to get their dinner
somewhere else, won't they?

297
00:21:17,683 --> 00:21:18,753
Look!

298
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,146
It's hay!

299
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:21,901
And water.

300
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:24,588
You are safe, my old friend.

301
00:21:25,671 --> 00:21:29,830
I'll go pay my respects to our
unwitting host.

302
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:32,848
Whoever that may be.

303
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:08,519
Thank you.

304
00:22:09,353 --> 00:22:10,473
Thank...

305
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:18,293
Hello?

306
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:22,034
Hello?

307
00:22:22,394 --> 00:22:24,085
Sorry to intrude.

308
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:26,189
I'm a.. just a traveler,

309
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:29,213
seeking shelter from the storm.

310
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:32,975
Sorry to disturb you.

311
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:39,826
Anyone home?

312
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:41,488
Anyone awake?

313
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,824
He must''ve lost his way
in the woods.

314
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,958
You have to keep quite!

315
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:51,181
Excuse me?

316
00:22:55,443 --> 00:22:57,085
Beautiful.

317
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,261
Extraordinary.

318
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,068
A man of taste.

319
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,778
He was talking about me.

320
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:35,659
Well, wherever you are..

321
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:40,182
I'm just going to warm myself
by the fire.

322
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:49,032
That's better.

323
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:51,926
Oh, much better.

324
00:24:10,343 --> 00:24:11,709
Thank you.

325
00:24:25,872 --> 00:24:28,432
Mom said I wasn't supposed to move,
because it might be scary.

326
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,327
Sorry.

327
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,320
It's alright.

328
00:24:44,628 --> 00:24:45,628
I cannot..

329
00:24:46,128 --> 00:24:49,693
Thank you enough for your hospitality.

330
00:24:50,475 --> 00:24:51,716
I'll..

331
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:56,339
leave you..

332
00:24:58,175 --> 00:25:00,014
and good night.

333
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,775
Come on Philippe, go! Go!

334
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:07,477
No, wait, wait, wait!

335
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:09,476
Roses. I nearly forgot.

336
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,068
Stay here.

337
00:25:13,022 --> 00:25:14,699
I promised Belle a rose.

338
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,980
There!

339
00:26:17,295 --> 00:26:18,295
Philippe!

340
00:26:24,487 --> 00:26:25,487
What happened?

341
00:26:26,938 --> 00:26:28,102
Where is Papa?

342
00:26:28,773 --> 00:26:29,773
Take me to him!

343
00:27:22,284 --> 00:27:23,879
Look! Cogsworth!

344
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,749
A beautiful girl!

345
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:28,253
Yes! I can see it's a girl.

346
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,196
I lost my hands, but my eyes.

347
00:27:30,536 --> 00:27:31,921
But, what if she's the one?

348
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,695
The one who'll break the spell?

349
00:27:34,797 --> 00:27:35,797
Who said that?

350
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,222
Who's there?

351
00:28:13,002 --> 00:28:14,057
Papa?

352
00:28:21,197 --> 00:28:22,642
Papa, is that you?

353
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:24,046
Belle!

354
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:25,735
How did you find me?

355
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:27,559
Your hands are iced.

356
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,079
We need to get you home.

357
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:31,044
Belle, now you must leave!

358
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:33,670
This castle is alive!

359
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:35,669
Now, go before he finds you!

360
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:36,889
Who?

361
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:47,427
Who's there?

362
00:28:48,406 --> 00:28:49,605
Who are you?

363
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:51,618
Who are you?

364
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:53,962
I've come to my father.

365
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:57,515
Your father is a thief!

366
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:58,976
Liar!

367
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:00,479
He stole a rose.

368
00:29:00,928 --> 00:29:02,211
I asked the rose.

369
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:03,798
Punish me, not him!

370
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:05,084
No!

371
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:06,109
He means forever!

372
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:11,409
Apparently, that's what happens around here
when you pick a flower!

373
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,203
A life sentence for a rose?

374
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:20,294
I received eternal damnation for one.

375
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,621
I merely locking him away.

376
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,530
Do you choose to take you father's
place?

377
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:28,911
Come in to the light.

378
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:38,933
Choose.

379
00:29:39,197 --> 00:29:41,252
Belle, I won't let you do this.

380
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:42,854
I lost your mother.

381
00:29:43,235 --> 00:29:45,414
I won't lose you, too!

382
00:29:46,014 --> 00:29:47,065
Now, go!

383
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:48,749
Go!

384
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:52,300
All right, Papa. I'll leave.

385
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,260
I need a minute alone with him.

386
00:29:58,936 --> 00:29:59,966
You are so cruel,

387
00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:02,822
did you won't allow a daughter
to say her father goodbye?

388
00:30:05,226 --> 00:30:07,429
Forever can spare a minute.

389
00:30:26,355 --> 00:30:30,497
When this door closes, it will
not open again.

390
00:30:35,361 --> 00:30:36,601
I should've been with you.

391
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,894
No. Belle, listen to me.

392
00:30:39,418 --> 00:30:40,982
It's all right.

393
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:42,690
Now, go.

394
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,401
Live your life.

395
00:30:44,706 --> 00:30:45,941
And forget me.

396
00:30:46,141 --> 00:30:47,443
Forget you?

397
00:30:47,783 --> 00:30:49,443
Everything I aim is because of you.

398
00:30:50,703 --> 00:30:52,012
I love you, Belle.

399
00:30:52,423 --> 00:30:53,623
Don't be afraid.

400
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,130
I love you too, Papa.

401
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:58,605
I'm not afraid.

402
00:31:01,508 --> 00:31:02,856
And I will escape, I promise.

403
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:05,354
Wh.. What?

404
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,822
You took his place.

405
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,207
He is my father.

406
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:16,075
He's a fool.

407
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,211
And so are you.

408
00:31:19,786 --> 00:31:20,786
Belle..

409
00:31:21,976 --> 00:31:22,976
Papa!

410
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:24,755
Don't hurt him!

411
00:31:24,993 --> 00:31:26,062
- Papa!
- No!

412
00:31:28,528 --> 00:31:29,537
I'll come back!

413
00:31:30,394 --> 00:31:31,529
I promise!

414
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,930
Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle.

415
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,930
But I have come to escort you
to your room.

416
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,929
My room?

417
00:31:51,905 --> 00:31:53,150
- But I thought...
- Oh, what?

418
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:56,962
That "Once this door closes,
it will not open again"?

419
00:31:58,115 --> 00:31:59,115
I know.

420
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,232
He gets all dramatic.

421
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:01,653
Hallo!

422
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:07,688
Oh, you are very strong.

423
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:09,455
This is a great quality.

424
00:32:10,107 --> 00:32:11,232
What are you?

425
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:13,008
I am Lumière!

426
00:32:13,589 --> 00:32:15,491
And.. You can talk?

427
00:32:15,843 --> 00:32:17,804
Of course, he can talk.

428
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:20,077
It's all he ever does.

429
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,985
Now, Lumière, as the head of
the household,

430
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:25,265
I demand that you to put her
back in her cell at once.

431
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:27,162
What do you want to be
for the rest of your life, Cogsworth?

432
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,160
A man or a mental clock?

433
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:31,256
Ready, miss?

434
00:32:31,635 --> 00:32:32,635
Trust me.

435
00:32:35,483 --> 00:32:38,987
You must forgive first impressions.
I hope you are not too startled.

436
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,899
Why would I be startled?

437
00:32:41,197 --> 00:32:42,317
I'm talking to a candle.

438
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:43,837
Candelabro, please.

439
00:32:44,192 --> 00:32:45,192
You know there's a difference.

440
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,781
But consider me at your service.
The castle is your own now,

441
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:49,928
so feel free to go anywhere
you like.

442
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:51,714
Except the west wing.

443
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:55,197
Uh, which we do not have.

444
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:57,840
Why? What's in the west wing?

445
00:32:58,095 --> 00:32:59,095
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

446
00:32:59,276 --> 00:33:00,396
- Storage space.
- Storage space.

447
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
- That's it
- That's it.

448
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,759
Yes, that's it!

449
00:33:02,838 --> 00:33:04,195
This way, please.
To the east wing.

450
00:33:04,575 --> 00:33:07,142
As I like to call it,
it's the only wing.

451
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,443
Ha ha. Watch your step,
s'il vou plait!

452
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:21,260
Welcome to your new room!

453
00:33:21,563 --> 00:33:23,380
It's modest, but comortable.

454
00:33:39,844 --> 00:33:41,432
It's.. beautiful.

455
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:42,798
But of course,

456
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:45,462
The Master wanted you to have
the finest room in the castle.

457
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:49,347
Oh, dear. We were not expecting guest.

458
00:33:50,247 --> 00:33:52,300
Enchanté, mademoiselle.

459
00:33:52,936 --> 00:33:53,936
Don't worry.

460
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:57,061
I'll have this place spotless
in no time.

461
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,325
This plan of yours is
dangerous.

462
00:34:02,684 --> 00:34:05,391
I would've risk anything to kiss you
again, Plumette.

463
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:08,263
No, my love. I've been burnt
by you before.

464
00:34:08,537 --> 00:34:09,537
We must be strong.

465
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,849
How can I be strong when
you make me so..

466
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:19,523
Is everything here alive?

467
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:21,846
Hello. What's your name?

468
00:34:24,336 --> 00:34:25,900
That is a hairbrush.

469
00:34:30,373 --> 00:34:31,678
Do not be alarmed.

470
00:34:32,017 --> 00:34:33,192
This is just your wardrobe.

471
00:34:33,462 --> 00:34:36,667
Meet Madame De Garderobe.
A great singer.

472
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:38,353
Which you can stay awake.

473
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:42,153
Cogsworth! A diva needs
a beauty rest.

474
00:34:43,555 --> 00:34:45,322
Stay with us, Madame.

475
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:47,112
We have someone for you
to dress!

476
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:49,513
Ah, finally!

477
00:34:49,702 --> 00:34:51,507
A woman!

478
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:53,604
Pretty eyes.

479
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,870
Proud face.

480
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:56,654
A perfect canvas. Yes!

481
00:34:57,254 --> 00:35:00,034
I will find you something worthy
of a princess.

482
00:35:00,377 --> 00:35:01,429
I'm not a princess.

483
00:35:01,742 --> 00:35:02,742
Non sense!

484
00:35:02,896 --> 00:35:05,447
Let's see what I got
in my drawer.

485
00:35:07,142 --> 00:35:08,796
Oh! How embarassing!

486
00:35:10,077 --> 00:35:11,726
<i>Froufrou, come and help mama.</i>

487
00:35:22,426 --> 00:35:24,026
Perfecto!

488
00:35:25,088 --> 00:35:27,406
Subtle, understated. I love it!
Au revoir!

489
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:31,733
<i>Froufrou, send my love to
the maestro.</i>

490
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:07,739
Picture it, LeFou.

491
00:36:07,964 --> 00:36:09,264
A rustic cabin,

492
00:36:09,564 --> 00:36:11,846
My latest kill roasting on the fire.

493
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:14,972
Adorable children running around us,
while my love...

494
00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:17,197
rubs my tired feet.

495
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,113
But what did Belle say?

496
00:36:19,587 --> 00:36:21,747
"I will never marry you, Gaston!"

497
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:24,589
You know, there are other girls.

498
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:28,677
A great man doesn't waste
his time.

499
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,603
<i>Gosh, it disturbs me to see you, Gaston</i>

500
00:36:31,909 --> 00:36:33,693
<i>Looking so down in the dumps.</i>

501
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:38,182
<i>Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston.</i>

502
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:40,947
<i>Even when taking your lumps.</i>

503
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:44,130
<i>There's no men in town as admired
as you.</i>

504
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:47,175
<i>You're everyone's favorite guy</i>

505
00:36:48,128 --> 00:36:51,807
<i>Everyone's awed and inspired by you</i>

506
00:36:52,016 --> 00:36:57,516
<i>And it's not very hard
to see why</i>

507
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:03,252
<i>No one's slick as Gaston</i>

508
00:37:03,593 --> 00:37:05,234
<i>No one's quick as Gaston</i>

509
00:37:05,512 --> 00:37:08,933
<i>No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston's</i>

510
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:12,163
<i>For there's no man in town half as manly</i>

511
00:37:12,627 --> 00:37:15,543
<i>Perfect, a pure paragon!</i>

512
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,827
<i>You can ask any Tom, Dick, or Stanley</i>

513
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:23,876
<i>And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on</i>

514
00:37:24,235 --> 00:37:29,120
<i>Who plays...?</i>

515
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:30,898
<i>dart like Gaston!</i>

516
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:32,145
<i>- Who breaks hearts
- Like Gaston!</i>

517
00:37:32,356 --> 00:37:34,906
<i>Who's much more than some of this...
like Gaston.</i>

518
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:39,185
<i>As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating.</i>

519
00:37:39,497 --> 00:37:42,408
<i>My, what a guy, that Gaston!</i>

520
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,093
<i>I needed encouragement.</i>

521
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:45,607
<i>Thank you, LeFou</i>

522
00:37:45,778 --> 00:37:49,884
<i>Well, there's no one as easy to bolster
as you</i>

523
00:37:52,078 --> 00:37:53,078
Too much?

524
00:37:53,278 --> 00:37:54,319
Yep.

525
00:37:54,636 --> 00:37:58,773
<i>No one fights like Gaston</i>

526
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,366
<i>Douses lights like Gaston</i>

527
00:38:00,831 --> 00:38:04,226
<i>In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston</i>

528
00:38:04,571 --> 00:38:06,978
<i>When I hunt, I sneak up with
my quiver</i>

529
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:10,063
<i>And beasts of the field say a prayer</i>

530
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:15,930
<i>Cause I'm carefully aimed for
the liver</i>

531
00:38:16,221 --> 00:38:17,221
<i>Then I shoot from behind</i>

532
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:18,456
<i>Is that fair?</i>

533
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,736
I don't care.

534
00:38:21,038 --> 00:38:22,417
<i>No one hits like Gaston</i>

535
00:38:22,723 --> 00:38:23,982
<i>Matches wits like Gaston</i>

536
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:27,813
<i>In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston</i>

537
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:31,683
<i>I'm especially good at expectorating!</i>

538
00:38:35,445 --> 00:38:37,135
Ten points for Gaston!

539
00:38:37,446 --> 00:38:39,173
Thank you. Thank you.

540
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:42,757
<i>When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs</i>

541
00:38:43,045 --> 00:38:45,659
<i>Every morning to help me get larger</i>

542
00:38:46,605 --> 00:38:49,558
<i>And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs</i>

543
00:38:49,886 --> 00:38:53,837
<i>So I'm roughly the size of a barge!</i>

544
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,393
<i>Who has brains..</i>

545
00:39:57,845 --> 00:39:58,845
<i>like Gaston?</i>

546
00:39:59,026 --> 00:40:00,236
<i>- Entertains
- like Gaston?</i>

547
00:40:00,594 --> 00:40:05,497
<i>Who can make up these endless
refrains like Gaston?</i>

548
00:40:06,817 --> 00:40:13,158
<i>I use antlers in all of
my decorating</i>

549
00:40:13,422 --> 00:40:14,988
<i>Say it again</i>

550
00:40:16,132 --> 00:40:17,835
<i>Who's a man among men?</i>

551
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:20,684
<i>Who's the super success?</i>

552
00:40:20,984 --> 00:40:22,380
<i>Don't you know?
Can't you guess?</i>

553
00:40:22,698 --> 00:40:25,690
<i>Ask his fans and his five
hhangers-on</i>

554
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:31,905
<i>There's just one guy in town
Who's got all of it down</i>

555
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:38,873
<i>And his name's
G-A-S-T..</i>

556
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:41,252
<i>I believe there's another T..</i>

557
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,500
<i>It just occurred to me that
I'm illiterate</i>

558
00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:50,059
<i>And I've never actually had to
spell it out loud before..</i>

559
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,352
<i>GASTON!</i>

560
00:41:02,314 --> 00:41:04,494
LeFou, you are the best.

561
00:41:04,785 --> 00:41:06,926
How is it no girls snatch you up yet?

562
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:10,453
I've been told that I'm clingy.
But I don't really get it.

563
00:41:16,145 --> 00:41:18,452
Please, please.
Someone, someone.

564
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:20,417
Help, help..

565
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,146
You must help me.

566
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:25,150
It's Belle! He's got Belle.
She's locked in a dungeon!

567
00:41:25,642 --> 00:41:26,642
Who's got her?

568
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:27,792
A beast!

569
00:41:28,107 --> 00:41:31,381
A huge, horrid, monstrous beast!

570
00:41:33,308 --> 00:41:34,909
My daughter's life is in danger.

571
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:37,209
Why do you laugh? It's no joke!

572
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:41,280
His castle is hidden in the woods.

573
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:44,146
It's already winter there.

574
00:41:44,475 --> 00:41:46,321
Winter in June?

575
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:47,864
Crazy old Maurice.

576
00:41:48,211 --> 00:41:50,167
Listen to me!

577
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,914
The beast is real.

578
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,898
Do you understand?

579
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,516
Well, no one help me?

580
00:42:00,897 --> 00:42:01,897
I'll help, Maurice.

581
00:42:02,196 --> 00:42:03,196
What?

582
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,473
You will?

583
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:06,057
Everybody,

584
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:09,218
stop making fun at this man at once.

585
00:42:09,554 --> 00:42:10,920
Captain, thank you.

586
00:42:11,169 --> 00:42:13,140
Don't thank me, Maurice.

587
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:14,914
Lead us to the Beast.

588
00:42:18,614 --> 00:42:19,854
Come.

589
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:27,345
Mama! There's a girl in the castle!

590
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:29,042
Yes, Chip! We know.

591
00:42:29,441 --> 00:42:30,481
What kind of tea does she likes?

592
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:32,114
Herbal, oolong,

593
00:42:32,441 --> 00:42:33,710
chamomille?

594
00:42:33,955 --> 00:42:34,955
I'm too excited!

595
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,562
Slow down, before you break
your handle.

596
00:42:37,926 --> 00:42:39,158
Hands up, Mrs. Potts.

597
00:42:57,966 --> 00:42:58,966
<i>Lumière!</i>

598
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,325
I'll be come. Let me do the talking.

599
00:43:02,595 --> 00:43:03,755
You're making her a dinner?

600
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,791
We thought you might appreciate
a company.

601
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:08,077
Master, I just want to assure you...

602
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:10,371
that I had no part in this
hopeless plan.

603
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,146
Preparing a dinner, designing a gown
for her, giving her a suite...

604
00:43:14,446 --> 00:43:15,750
in the east wing.

605
00:43:16,081 --> 00:43:17,496
You gave her a bedroom?

606
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:19,322
No, no, no. He gave her a bedroom.

607
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:20,589
This is true.

608
00:43:20,713 --> 00:43:22,479
But, if this girl is the one
who can break the spell,

609
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:25,306
then maybe you could stop by using dinner
to charm her.

610
00:43:25,674 --> 00:43:27,456
- Good thinking, Cogsworth!
- What?

611
00:43:27,804 --> 00:43:31,143
That's the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard!
Charm the prisoner?

612
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,825
But you must try, Master.
With every passing day...

613
00:43:34,214 --> 00:43:35,818
we become less human.

614
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,546
She's the daughter of a common thief.

615
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,340
What kind of person do you think
that makes her?

616
00:43:40,406 --> 00:43:44,433
Ow, you can't judge people by who
their father is, now can you?

617
00:43:49,046 --> 00:43:50,442
You'll join me for dinner.

618
00:43:50,891 --> 00:43:52,019
That's not a request.

619
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:53,299
Gently, Master.

620
00:43:53,581 --> 00:43:54,918
The girl lost her father

621
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:56,974
and her freedom in one day.

622
00:43:57,328 --> 00:43:59,671
Yes, the poor thing is probably in there,
scare to death.

623
00:44:00,093 --> 00:44:01,093
Exactly.

624
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:11,287
Just a minute.

625
00:44:11,569 --> 00:44:14,914
You see? There she is.
Now remember, be gentle.

626
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:16,965
- Kind!
- Charming!

627
00:44:17,211 --> 00:44:18,054
Sweet!

628
00:44:18,131 --> 00:44:22,171
And when she opens the door,
give her a dashing smile.

629
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,743
Come, come, show me the smile.

630
00:44:25,351 --> 00:44:26,351
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, no.

631
00:44:32,133 --> 00:44:34,186
Will you join me for dinner?

632
00:44:37,189 --> 00:44:41,028
You've taken me as your prisoner,
and now you want to have dinner with me?

633
00:44:41,683 --> 00:44:42,753
Are you insane?

634
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:45,709
O, o, he's losing it.

635
00:44:45,832 --> 00:44:47,096
Oh, dear.

636
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,875
I told you to join me
for dinner!

637
00:44:52,149 --> 00:44:53,587
I told you, no!

638
00:44:54,896 --> 00:44:56,234
What, what time is it?

639
00:44:56,616 --> 00:44:57,622
What's happening?

640
00:44:57,894 --> 00:45:00,656
I'd starved before I ever
ate with you.

641
00:45:00,924 --> 00:45:02,003
Well, be my guest!

642
00:45:02,376 --> 00:45:03,954
Go ahed and starve!

643
00:45:06,056 --> 00:45:07,280
If she doesn't eat with me,

644
00:45:07,536 --> 00:45:08,877
then she doesn't eat at all.

645
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:10,998
Idiot!

646
00:45:12,658 --> 00:45:14,856
You can't talk to us like that.
I forbid it.

647
00:45:17,073 --> 00:45:18,073
Am I too late?

648
00:45:18,323 --> 00:45:20,624
Shame, I was ready enough
to tell him off this time.

649
00:45:20,939 --> 00:45:23,083
Oh, Master! You've returned!

650
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:26,865
- Very funny.
- I got you there!

651
00:45:46,692 --> 00:45:48,168
Show me the girl.

652
00:46:24,707 --> 00:46:25,808
Another petal fell.

653
00:46:26,088 --> 00:46:27,088
Lumière...

654
00:46:27,347 --> 00:46:30,831
I grew three more feathers.
And I just plugged yesterday.

655
00:46:31,127 --> 00:46:33,088
I know, darling.

656
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:36,492
I'm getting more metallic
everyday.

657
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:40,891
Oh, no. It's happening again.
Pardon me.

658
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,007
Oh, everyone, calm yourself.

659
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:45,209
We still have time.

660
00:46:45,454 --> 00:46:46,303
Mama,

661
00:46:46,459 --> 00:46:48,445
am I ever going to be a boy again?

662
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:51,206
Oh, es, Chip. You'll have your days

663
00:46:51,515 --> 00:46:54,254
in the sun again.
You just leave it to me.

664
00:47:04,742 --> 00:47:05,853
I told you to go away.

665
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,826
Don't worry, dear.
It's only Mrs. Potts.

666
00:47:19,115 --> 00:47:20,544
Oh, I own you a vision!

667
00:47:20,874 --> 00:47:21,874
How lovely...

668
00:47:21,946 --> 00:47:24,055
to my *** to miss.

669
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:30,159
It's a very long journey.
Let me fix you up

670
00:47:30,457 --> 00:47:31,740
before you go.

671
00:47:32,077 --> 00:47:33,082
I have found..

672
00:47:33,265 --> 00:47:35,557
that most of the troubles
seem less troubling,

673
00:47:35,883 --> 00:47:38,560
after a bracing cup of tea.

674
00:47:38,911 --> 00:47:40,477
Slowly now, Chip.

675
00:47:47,443 --> 00:47:48,443
Pleased to meet you.

676
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:50,798
Wanna see me do a trick?

677
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,440
Chip!

678
00:47:54,215 --> 00:47:58,159
That was a very brave thing
you did for your father, deary.

679
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,824
Yes.

680
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:01,659
We all think so.

681
00:48:01,886 --> 00:48:02,886
I'm worried about him.

682
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,080
He's never been on his own.

683
00:48:06,392 --> 00:48:08,059
Cheer up, my puppet.

684
00:48:08,327 --> 00:48:11,750
Things will turn out in the end.
You'll feel a lot better

685
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:13,418
after dinner.

686
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:16,689
But he said, "if she doesn't eat with me,
she doesn't eat at all".

687
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:19,468
People say a lot of things
in anger.

688
00:48:19,798 --> 00:48:21,731
It is our choice whether or not
to listen.

689
00:48:22,273 --> 00:48:23,388
You coming, puppet?

690
00:48:23,864 --> 00:48:24,888
Go.

691
00:48:25,764 --> 00:48:28,464
They're coming! Final checks, everyone!

692
00:48:28,729 --> 00:48:29,729
No, you don't!

693
00:48:29,804 --> 00:48:33,063
If the Master finds that you buy and order
some **. He will blame me!

694
00:48:33,442 --> 00:48:34,539
Yes, I will make sure of it.

695
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:38,292
But, did you see us stand up to win?
I am telling you, this girl is the one.

696
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,445
They must fall in love,
if we are to be human again.

697
00:48:40,756 --> 00:48:42,673
And how can they fall in love if
she stays in her room?

698
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:44,514
Ay, Chapeau, you missed
this spot.

699
00:48:44,865 --> 00:48:46,168
You know, she'll never love him.

700
00:48:46,487 --> 00:48:49,068
A broken clock is right two times
a day, mon ami.

701
00:48:49,366 --> 00:48:51,166
But this is not one of those times!
Stand up straight!

702
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:52,762
It's time to sparkle!

703
00:48:53,121 --> 00:48:56,268
I have no taste buds,
but I can tell this is exquisite.

704
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,108
Get off me while I work!

705
00:48:58,453 --> 00:49:00,354
Pepper, ***!
Salt, ***!

706
00:49:00,668 --> 00:49:03,503
Not so loud. Keep it down.

707
00:49:03,814 --> 00:49:07,569
Of course, of course. But what is dinner
without a little music?

708
00:49:07,846 --> 00:49:08,846
Music?

709
00:49:09,253 --> 00:49:11,475
Maestro Cadanza, are you ready?

710
00:49:13,629 --> 00:49:15,899
It has been so long since
I've performed.

711
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:18,523
I can't barely even remember how.

712
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,380
Another cavity.

713
00:49:25,612 --> 00:49:27,395
Maestro, your wife is upstairs.

714
00:49:27,771 --> 00:49:29,988
Finding it harder and harder
to stay awake.

715
00:49:30,357 --> 00:49:32,926
She's counting on you to help us
break this curse.

716
00:49:33,173 --> 00:49:36,123
Then I shall play through
the dental pain.

717
00:49:36,468 --> 00:49:38,884
Maestro, play quartet, please.

718
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,758
Oh, quartet. Sotto voce!
Of course!

719
00:49:42,174 --> 00:49:45,495
Are there any other tasteless demands
you wished to make upon my artistry?

720
00:49:46,474 --> 00:49:47,474
No, that's it.

721
00:49:47,774 --> 00:49:49,524
There you are, dear.

722
00:49:59,523 --> 00:50:01,482
<i>Ma chère mademoiselle!</i>

723
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,146
<i>It is with the deepest pride</i>

724
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,417
<i>and greatest pleasure</i>

725
00:50:04,454 --> 00:50:06,179
<i>that we welcome you tonight!</i>

726
00:50:06,475 --> 00:50:07,226
<i>Mhm.. here.</i>

727
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:08,527
<i>And now,</i>

728
00:50:08,777 --> 00:50:10,813
<i>we invite you to relax.</i>

729
00:50:12,076 --> 00:50:13,427
<i>Let us pull up a chair</i>

730
00:50:14,653 --> 00:50:18,229
<i>as the dining room proudly presents</i>

731
00:50:28,536 --> 00:50:30,184
<i>Your dinner!</i>

732
00:50:33,058 --> 00:50:37,759
<i>Be our.. Guest.
Be our guest</i>

733
00:50:38,066 --> 00:50:40,419
<i>Put our service to the test</i>

734
00:50:40,781 --> 00:50:43,504
<i>Tie your napkin around your neck,
cherie. And we'll</i>

735
00:50:43,682 --> 00:50:45,477
<i>provide the rest.</i>

736
00:50:45,802 --> 00:50:50,403
<i>Soup du jour! Hot hors d'oeuvres!
While we only live to serve.</i>

737
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:53,084
<i>Try the grey stuff, it's delicious.</i>

738
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,626
<i>Don't believe me? Ask the dishes.</i>

739
00:51:00,234 --> 00:51:02,482
<i>They can sing, they can dance.</i>

740
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,784
<i>After all, Miss, this is France!</i>

741
00:51:05,186 --> 00:51:08,936
<i>And a dinner here is never second best</i>

742
00:51:09,271 --> 00:51:11,743
<i>Go on, unfold your menu</i>

743
00:51:11,976 --> 00:51:16,437
<i>Take a glance and then you'll
be our guest. Oui, our guest.</i>

744
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,312
<i>Be our guest</i>

745
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:23,947
<i>Beef ragout</i>

746
00:51:24,108 --> 00:51:25,225
<i>Cheese souffle</i>

747
00:51:25,527 --> 00:51:27,096
<i>Pie and pudding "en flambe"</i>

748
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:30,967
<i>We'll prepare and serve with flair
a culinary cabaret</i>

749
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:34,073
<i>You're alone and you're scared</i>

750
00:51:34,459 --> 00:51:36,242
<i>But the banquet's all prepared</i>

751
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:40,421
<i>No one's gloomy or complaining
while the flatware's entertaining</i>

752
00:51:40,746 --> 00:51:42,091
<i>We tell jokes
I do tricks</i>

753
00:51:42,484 --> 00:51:44,767
<i>With my fellow candlesticks</i>

754
00:51:45,116 --> 00:51:48,592
<i>And it's all in perfect taste
that you can bet</i>

755
00:51:48,911 --> 00:51:50,823
<i>Come on and lift your glass</i>

756
00:51:51,189 --> 00:51:54,692
<i>You've won your own free pass
to be our guest</i>

757
00:51:54,977 --> 00:51:57,692
<i>If you're stressed,
it's fine dining we suggest</i>

758
00:51:57,928 --> 00:51:58,928
<i>Be our guest</i>

759
00:51:59,132 --> 00:52:03,923
<i>Be our guest, be our guest</i>

760
00:52:04,576 --> 00:52:09,769
<i>Life is so unnerving for a servant
who's not serving</i>

761
00:52:10,068 --> 00:52:13,914
<i>He's not whole without a soul to wait upon</i>

762
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:18,788
<i>Ah, those good old days when we were useful</i>

763
00:52:18,981 --> 00:52:19,981
<i>Hey, Cogsworth?</i>

764
00:52:20,182 --> 00:52:24,225
<i>Suddenly those good old days are gone</i>

765
00:52:26,237 --> 00:52:29,154
<i>Too long we've been rusting</i>

766
00:52:29,551 --> 00:52:31,630
<i>Needing so much more than dusting</i>

767
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:36,828
<i>Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills</i>

768
00:52:39,773 --> 00:52:44,049
<i>Most days we just lay around the castle</i>

769
00:52:44,298 --> 00:52:47,848
<i>Flabby, fat and lazy!
You walked in and oops-a-daisy!</i>

770
00:52:48,078 --> 00:52:51,696
<i>It's a guest! It's a guest!
Sakes alive, well I'll be blessed</i>

771
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:55,981
<i>Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed</i>

772
00:52:56,245 --> 00:53:00,035
<i>With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear that's fine with me</i>

773
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:02,014
<i>While the cups do their soft shoeing</i>

774
00:53:02,358 --> 00:53:04,900
<i>I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing</i>

775
00:53:15,368 --> 00:53:17,087
<i>I'll get warm, piping hot</i>

776
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,043
<i>Heaven's sakes! Is that a spot?</i>

777
00:53:19,301 --> 00:53:22,977
<i>Clean it up! We want the company impressed</i>

778
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,743
<i>We've got a lot to do</i>

779
00:53:25,198 --> 00:53:27,088
<i>Is it one lump or two</i>

780
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,494
<i>For you, our guest?</i>

781
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:29,805
<i>She's our guest</i>

782
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,880
<i>She's our guest</i>

783
00:53:31,085 --> 00:53:32,085
<i>She's our guest</i>

784
00:53:32,194 --> 00:53:35,976
<i>Be our guest, be our guest
Our command is your request</i>

785
00:53:36,203 --> 00:53:40,176
<i>It's ten years since we had anybody here
And we're obsessed</i>

786
00:53:40,472 --> 00:53:42,135
<i>With your meal</i>

787
00:53:42,562 --> 00:53:44,564
<i>With your ease</i>

788
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:48,856
<i>Yes, indeed, we aim to please</i>

789
00:53:49,007 --> 00:53:51,848
<i>While the candlelight's still glowing</i>

790
00:53:53,508 --> 00:53:57,028
<i>Let us help you
We'll keep going</i>

791
00:54:00,606 --> 00:54:03,598
<i>Course by course</i>

792
00:54:03,888 --> 00:54:07,351
<i>One by one</i>

793
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:10,075
<i>'Til you shout, "Enough! I'm done!"</i>

794
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:14,052
<i>Then we'll sing you off to sleep
as you digest</i>

795
00:54:14,308 --> 00:54:18,242
<i>Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up</i>

796
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:19,954
<i>And be our guest</i>

797
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,472
<i>Be our guest</i>

798
00:54:22,366 --> 00:54:23,696
<i>Be our guest</i>

799
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:30,211
<i>Please, be our guest</i>

800
00:54:33,287 --> 00:54:34,287
Budin?

801
00:54:38,367 --> 00:54:40,542
I don't understand why you'e all
being so kind to me.

802
00:54:41,334 --> 00:54:43,214
Surely, you're as trapped here
as I am.

803
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:45,106
Don't you ever want to escape?

804
00:54:45,444 --> 00:54:50,081
The Master is not as terrible
as he appears.

805
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:53,866
Somewhere, deep in his soul
there's a prince..

806
00:54:54,104 --> 00:54:58,157
of a fellow just waiting
to be set free.

807
00:54:59,616 --> 00:55:01,967
Lumière mentioned something
about the west wing.

808
00:55:02,252 --> 00:55:04,453
Never you mind about that.

809
00:55:04,717 --> 00:55:05,771
Off to bed with you, puppet.

810
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:08,217
- Good night.
- Nighty night.

811
00:55:13,115 --> 00:55:14,748
Straight to bed.

812
00:56:47,955 --> 00:56:49,651
What are you doing here?
What did you do to it?

813
00:56:49,961 --> 00:56:50,672
Nothing.

814
00:56:50,951 --> 00:56:53,367
Do you realize what you could've done?
You could've ruined us all!

815
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:54,774
Get out of here!

816
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:57,063
Go!

817
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:07,983
Check mate. Again.

818
00:57:08,389 --> 00:57:09,939
Wait, No! You're cheating again!

819
00:57:10,633 --> 00:57:12,812
Mademoiselle, what are you doing?

820
00:57:13,164 --> 00:57:14,664
Getting out of here!

821
00:57:14,834 --> 00:57:16,172
Stop!

822
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,157
Go! Go, Froufrou!

823
00:57:20,121 --> 00:57:21,528
Yes­, Froufrou. Stop her!

824
00:57:21,785 --> 00:57:22,909
Don't let her leave!

825
00:57:23,175 --> 00:57:24,636
Stop her!

826
00:57:24,956 --> 00:57:25,956
No, no, Froufrou!

827
00:57:26,001 --> 00:57:27,286
No, no! Not time to play!

828
00:57:27,591 --> 00:57:29,137
Not now, silly boy!

829
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,782
Bad dog! Bad dog!

830
00:57:31,121 --> 00:57:32,532
No! No!

831
00:57:32,836 --> 00:57:33,895
Please, don't go.

832
00:57:34,237 --> 00:57:35,237
It's dangerous!

833
00:57:35,492 --> 00:57:37,017
Oh, my!

834
01:00:14,688 --> 01:00:15,688
You have to help me.

835
01:00:17,108 --> 01:00:18,831
You have to stand.

836
01:00:35,909 --> 01:00:38,623
No! I'm sure this is the way.

837
01:00:38,723 --> 01:00:39,891
Do you hear those wolves?

838
01:00:40,092 --> 01:00:42,898
That means we're getting very close
to the castle.

839
01:00:43,099 --> 01:00:45,795
Look, enough is enough.
We have to turn back.

840
01:00:45,996 --> 01:00:46,795
Stop!

841
01:00:46,997 --> 01:00:49,017
That's it! There it is!

842
01:00:49,718 --> 01:00:51,215
That's the tree!

843
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:52,800
I'm sure of it.

844
01:00:52,901 --> 01:00:56,465
It.. It was down by lightning
at the time.

845
01:00:56,665 --> 01:00:58,367
But now it's..

846
01:00:58,467 --> 01:01:00,166
resume to an upright
position,

847
01:01:00,368 --> 01:01:01,569
to some sort of..

848
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:04,390
Magic, or.. Or other.

849
01:01:04,591 --> 01:01:06,844
You really want to marry
into this family?

850
01:01:07,046 --> 01:01:08,046
So that means..

851
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,020
The castle is that..

852
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,160
No.

853
01:01:11,661 --> 01:01:12,894
No, it's...

854
01:01:15,383 --> 01:01:16,389
That way!

855
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,174
Definitely, that way!

856
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:21,617
I'm done playing this game, Maurice.

857
01:01:21,717 --> 01:01:23,331
Where is Belle?

858
01:01:23,632 --> 01:01:25,475
The Beast took her and she..

859
01:01:25,676 --> 01:01:27,653
There are no such things
as beasts.

860
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:29,548
Or talking teacups.

861
01:01:29,849 --> 01:01:31,008
Or magic!

862
01:01:31,211 --> 01:01:34,557
But there are wolves, frosbite,
and starvation!

863
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,392
Deep breath, Gaston.

864
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:39,632
Deep breath.

865
01:01:42,423 --> 01:01:45,612
So why don't we just turn around,
go back to Villeneuve?

866
01:01:45,713 --> 01:01:48,112
I'm sure Belle is at home,
cooking up a lovely dinner.

867
01:01:48,313 --> 01:01:49,696
If you think I've made all this up,

868
01:01:49,898 --> 01:01:52,602
then why did you offer to help?

869
01:01:52,803 --> 01:01:54,495
Because I want to marry your daughter!

870
01:01:57,211 --> 01:01:59,649
Now, let's go home.

871
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,433
Belle is not at home!

872
01:02:01,734 --> 01:02:02,987
She is with the..

873
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,658
You say "beast" one more time,

874
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,677
I will feed you to the wolves!

875
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:10,272
Gaston! Stop it!
Breath!

876
01:02:10,472 --> 01:02:12,532
Think of happy thoughts.
Go back to the war.

877
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:14,133
Bloods.

878
01:02:14,335 --> 01:02:16,707
Explosions. Countless widows.

879
01:02:16,909 --> 01:02:18,208
- Widows.
- Yes, yes.

880
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:19,608
That's it.

881
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:22,521
That's it.

882
01:02:24,902 --> 01:02:26,386
Maurice!

883
01:02:27,553 --> 01:02:29,850
Please, forgive me, old bean.

884
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:32,067
There's no way to talk to
my future father-in-law,

885
01:02:32,269 --> 01:02:33,269
now, is it?

886
01:02:33,369 --> 01:02:34,475
Future father-in-law?

887
01:02:34,673 --> 01:02:35,673
Yes!

888
01:02:35,874 --> 01:02:39,728
You will never marry my daughter.

889
01:02:45,915 --> 01:02:47,093
I saw that, Captain.

890
01:02:47,907 --> 01:02:50,051
If Maurice won't give me
his blessing,

891
01:02:50,251 --> 01:02:52,075
then he's in my way.

892
01:02:52,275 --> 01:02:53,804
Once the wolves have finished
with him

893
01:02:53,969 --> 01:02:56,600
Belle will have no one to take of her,
but me.

894
01:02:56,801 --> 01:02:58,490
Let's say we're adjusting
our all options...

895
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:01,063
Do we maybe wanna consider

896
01:03:01,564 --> 01:03:02,692
a slightly less gruesome alternatives?

897
01:03:02,893 --> 01:03:03,893
Are you coming?

898
01:03:09,067 --> 01:03:10,067
Get!

899
01:03:17,943 --> 01:03:18,943
That hurts!

900
01:03:19,271 --> 01:03:21,764
If you held still, it wouldn't hurt
as much.

901
01:03:22,065 --> 01:03:24,372
If hadn't runaway,
none of this would've happened.

902
01:03:24,573 --> 01:03:26,377
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't've runaway!

903
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,305
Well, you shouldn't've been in
the west wing!

904
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:31,252
Well, you should learn to control
your temper!

905
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:42,834
Try to get some rest.

906
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:44,371
Thank you, miss.

907
01:03:44,573 --> 01:03:46,842
We are eternally grateful.

908
01:03:47,143 --> 01:03:49,280
Why do you care about him
so much?

909
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,179
We've looked after him
all his life.

910
01:03:52,153 --> 01:03:54,626
But he's cursed you somehow.
Why?

911
01:03:54,826 --> 01:03:56,045
You did nothing.

912
01:03:57,046 --> 01:03:59,463
You're quite right there, dear.

913
01:03:59,664 --> 01:04:02,448
You see, when the Master
lost his mother

914
01:04:02,749 --> 01:04:05,890
and his cruel father took that
sweet innocent lad, and

915
01:04:07,773 --> 01:04:09,940
twisted him up to be
just like him.

916
01:04:10,341 --> 01:04:12,311
We did nothing.

917
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:14,058
Let him sleep.

918
01:04:26,437 --> 01:04:28,674
<i>Days in the sun</i>

919
01:04:28,876 --> 01:04:32,737
<i>When my life has barely begun</i>

920
01:04:32,938 --> 01:04:36,936
<i>Not until my whole life is done</i>

921
01:04:37,138 --> 01:04:41,330
<i>Will I ever leave you?</i>

922
01:05:02,725 --> 01:05:05,933
<i>Will I tremble again?</i>

923
01:05:06,134 --> 01:05:10,178
<i>To my dear one's gorgeous refrain</i>

924
01:05:10,379 --> 01:05:14,256
<i>Will you now forever remain</i>

925
01:05:14,457 --> 01:05:19,135
<i>Out of reach of my arms</i>

926
01:05:19,335 --> 01:05:22,634
<i>All those days in the sun</i>

927
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:26,819
<i>What I'd give to relive just one</i>

928
01:05:27,019 --> 01:05:28,282
Good night, Mama.

929
01:05:28,483 --> 01:05:30,760
<i>Undo what's done</i>

930
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,582
<i>And bring back the light</i>

931
01:05:35,654 --> 01:05:39,196
<i>Oh, I could sing</i>

932
01:05:39,497 --> 01:05:44,391
<i>of the pain these dark days bring</i>

933
01:05:44,692 --> 01:05:49,590
<i>The spell we're under</i>

934
01:05:49,791 --> 01:05:54,792
<i>Still it's the wonder of us
I sing of tonight</i>

935
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:58,832
<i>How in the midst of all this sorrow</i>

936
01:05:59,034 --> 01:06:02,531
<i>Can so much hope and love endure</i>

937
01:06:02,732 --> 01:06:06,491
<i>I was innocent and certain</i>

938
01:06:06,691 --> 01:06:10,298
<i>Now I'm wiser but unsure</i>

939
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:14,287
<i>- Days in the back
- I can't go back into my childhood</i>

940
01:06:14,588 --> 01:06:20,017
<i>- Oh, all those precious days
- That my father made secure</i>

941
01:06:20,556 --> 01:06:23,838
<i>I can feel a change in me</i>

942
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:29,631
<i>I'm stronger now but still not free</i>

943
01:06:29,733 --> 01:06:32,422
<i>Days in the sun</i>

944
01:06:32,623 --> 01:06:37,591
<i>Will return, we must believe</i>

945
01:06:37,892 --> 01:06:42,379
<i>As lovers do</i>

946
01:06:42,579 --> 01:06:45,271
<i>That days in the sun</i>

947
01:06:45,572 --> 01:06:51,569
<i>Will come shining through</i>

948
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,990
What happens when the last petal
falls?

949
01:06:58,191 --> 01:07:01,786
The Master remains a beast forever.
And we become..

950
01:07:01,986 --> 01:07:03,862
- Antiques.
- Knick knacks.

951
01:07:03,962 --> 01:07:05,404
Lightly used housewares.

952
01:07:05,506 --> 01:07:06,506
Rubbish.

953
01:07:06,806 --> 01:07:08,670
We become rubbish.

954
01:07:09,471 --> 01:07:11,247
I want to help you.

955
01:07:11,548 --> 01:07:13,490
There must be someway to break
the curse.

956
01:07:14,092 --> 01:07:16,333
Well, there is one.

957
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:18,691
It's not for you to worry about,
lamb.

958
01:07:18,892 --> 01:07:22,268
We've made our bad
and we must lie in it.

959
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:15,803
Drink.

960
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:25,219
Thank you, Agathe.

964
01:08:39,414 --> 01:08:41,134
You know Shakespeare?

965
01:08:43,053 --> 01:08:45,412
I had an expensive education.

966
01:08:46,775 --> 01:08:49,224
Actually, "Romeo and Juliet"
is my favorite play.

967
01:08:50,613 --> 01:08:53,084
Ugh, why is that not a surprise?

968
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,051
I'm sorry?

969
01:08:55,253 --> 01:08:58,977
Well, you know that heartache,
pining, and blublb.. ekh.

970
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:02,161
So many better things to read.

971
01:09:03,191 --> 01:09:04,368
Like what?

972
01:09:05,168 --> 01:09:09,747
Well, there are a couple things in here,
which you could start.

973
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,075
You all right?

974
01:09:22,648 --> 01:09:24,725
It's wonderful!

975
01:09:28,118 --> 01:09:30,439
Yes, I suppose it is.

976
01:09:35,536 --> 01:09:37,707
Well, if you like it so much,
then it's yours.

977
01:09:43,895 --> 01:09:45,494
Have you really read every one
of these books?

978
01:09:45,794 --> 01:09:46,794
What?

979
01:09:48,663 --> 01:09:51,425
Well, not all of them.

980
01:09:51,725 --> 01:09:53,891
Some of them are in Greek.

981
01:09:54,389 --> 01:09:55,791
Was that a joke?

982
01:09:57,421 --> 01:09:58,823
Are you making jokes now?

983
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:02,230
Maybe.

984
01:10:36,376 --> 01:10:39,798
<i>The air is blue, keen and cold...</i>

985
01:10:39,999 --> 01:10:42,769
"and in a frozen sheath enrolled.

986
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:44,951
"Each branch, each twig...

987
01:10:45,152 --> 01:10:48,734
"each blade of grass,
seems clad miraculously with...

988
01:10:50,964 --> 01:10:52,016
"glass".

989
01:10:59,209 --> 01:11:01,547
Why does it feel like if I'm seeing it
for the first time?

990
01:11:06,868 --> 01:11:07,892
Is there anymore?

991
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:18,673
"But in that solemn silence
is heard the whisper...

992
01:11:18,873 --> 01:11:20,796
"of every sleeping things.

993
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,728
"Look. Look at me.

994
01:11:26,252 --> 01:11:28,248
"Come wake me up

995
01:11:30,002 --> 01:11:31,892
"For still here I'll be".

996
01:12:00,604 --> 01:12:03,951
<i>There's something sweet and almost kind</i>

997
01:12:04,652 --> 01:12:08,539
<i>But he was mean and he was coarse
and unrefined</i>

998
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:12,079
<i>And now he's dear and so unsure</i>

999
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,386
<i>I wonder why I didn't see it there
before</i>

1000
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,634
<i>She glanced this way... I though
I saw</i>

1001
01:12:30,734 --> 01:12:34,317
<i>And when we touched, she didn't shudder
at my paw</i>

1002
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:38,326
<i>No it can't be, I'll just ignore</i>

1003
01:12:38,627 --> 01:12:41,913
<i>But then she's never looked at me
that way before</i>

1004
01:13:12,651 --> 01:13:18,229
<i>New and a bit alarming</i>

1005
01:13:19,377 --> 01:13:25,618
<i>Who'd have ever thought that this could be?</i>

1006
01:13:28,185 --> 01:13:34,191
<i>True that he's no Prince Charming</i>

1007
01:13:34,593 --> 01:13:40,586
<i>But there's something in him that
I simply didn't see</i>

1008
01:13:43,095 --> 01:13:44,876
<i>- Well, who'd have thought?
- Well, bless my soul</i>

1009
01:13:45,077 --> 01:13:46,679
<i>- Well, who'd have known?
- Well, who indeed?</i>

1010
01:13:46,981 --> 01:13:49,719
<i>And who'd have guessed they'd come
together on their own?</i>

1011
01:13:49,921 --> 01:13:51,622
<i>It's so peculiar, wait and see</i>

1012
01:13:51,923 --> 01:13:54,502
<i>We'll wait and see
A few days more</i>

1013
01:13:54,803 --> 01:13:57,844
<i>There may be something there
that wasn't there before</i>

1014
01:13:58,602 --> 01:14:00,293
Well, here's a thought..

1015
01:14:00,594 --> 01:14:04,202
Perhaps there's something there
that wasn't there before

1016
01:14:04,814 --> 01:14:06,009
What, Mama?

1017
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:12,973
<i>There may be something there
that wasn't there before</i>

1018
01:14:14,429 --> 01:14:16,832
What is it? What's there?

1019
01:14:17,032 --> 01:14:19,528
I will tell you when you're older.

1020
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,471
Okay, I'm older.

1021
01:14:23,503 --> 01:14:24,603
Oh, Chip.

1022
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:27,740
You are ***

1023
01:14:42,318 --> 01:14:43,690
What are you reading?

1024
01:14:43,991 --> 01:14:44,991
Nothing.

1025
01:14:46,306 --> 01:14:47,813
<i>Guinevere and Lancelot</i>

1026
01:14:48,114 --> 01:14:49,677
Well, actually..

1027
01:14:49,878 --> 01:14:52,130
King Arthur and the Round Table,

1028
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:55,206
Knights, men, swords, and
so on.

1029
01:14:56,899 --> 01:14:58,042
But still

1030
01:14:58,787 --> 01:14:59,787
it's a romance.

1031
01:14:59,934 --> 01:15:01,234
Alright.

1032
01:15:04,811 --> 01:15:07,165
I never thank you for saving
my life.

1033
01:15:08,039 --> 01:15:09,630
Well, I never thank you

1034
01:15:09,931 --> 01:15:12,459
for not leaving me to be eaten
by wolves.

1035
01:15:16,421 --> 01:15:18,209
They know how to have
a good time.

1036
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:22,350
Yes, but when I enter the room,
the laughter dies.

1037
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,625
Me, too.

1038
01:15:26,798 --> 01:15:28,906
The villagers say that I'm
a funny girl.

1039
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:31,264
But I'm not sure they mean it
as a compliment.

1040
01:15:31,465 --> 01:15:32,465
I'm sorry.

1041
01:15:33,744 --> 01:15:35,603
Your village sounds terrible.

1042
01:15:36,805 --> 01:15:38,245
Not as lonely as your castle.

1043
01:15:40,338 --> 01:15:42,771
What dou you say
we'd runaway?

1044
01:15:55,113 --> 01:15:58,348
Another little gift from the enchantress.

1045
01:16:01,942 --> 01:16:04,660
A book that'll allow you to escape.

1046
01:16:11,005 --> 01:16:12,005
Amazing!

1047
01:16:13,109 --> 01:16:15,477
It was the cruelest trick of all.

1048
01:16:16,035 --> 01:16:18,125
It was just another curse.

1049
01:16:18,326 --> 01:16:22,505
The outside world has no place
for a creature like me.

1050
01:16:23,283 --> 01:16:25,050
But it can for you.

1051
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:34,210
Think of the one place you've always
wanted to see.

1052
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:40,443
Now, find it in your mind's eye.

1053
01:16:41,043 --> 01:16:42,828
And then feel it in your heart.

1054
01:17:13,418 --> 01:17:15,338
Where did you take us?

1055
01:17:15,939 --> 01:17:17,122
Paris.

1056
01:17:17,722 --> 01:17:19,832
I used to love Paris.

1057
01:17:21,796 --> 01:17:23,443
What would you like to see first?

1058
01:17:23,644 --> 01:17:24,702
Notre Dame?

1059
01:17:25,003 --> 01:17:26,705
Los Champs-Élysées?

1060
01:17:27,007 --> 01:17:27,806
No?

1061
01:17:28,007 --> 01:17:29,952
Too touristy?

1062
01:17:31,059 --> 01:17:33,897
It's so much more that I imagined.

1063
01:17:43,373 --> 01:17:47,182
<i>This is the Paris of my childhood</i>

1064
01:17:48,334 --> 01:17:52,391
<i>This what the borders of my life</i>

1065
01:17:52,592 --> 01:17:56,817
<i>In this crumbling dusty attic</i>

1066
01:17:57,118 --> 01:18:01,242
<i>Where an artist loved his wife</i>

1067
01:18:02,147 --> 01:18:06,245
<i>Is it to remember?</i>

1068
01:18:06,546 --> 01:18:10,212
<i>Or it to move on?</i>

1069
01:18:13,378 --> 01:18:16,534
<i>Knowing the Paris of my childhood..</i>

1070
01:18:18,435 --> 01:18:20,688
<i>is gone</i>

1071
01:18:28,138 --> 01:18:29,416
What happened to your mother?

1072
01:18:29,618 --> 01:18:32,719
It was the one story, Papa can never
bring himself to tell.

1073
01:18:33,019 --> 01:18:34,706
I think, better not to ask.

1074
01:18:37,742 --> 01:18:39,364
A doctor's mask.

1075
01:18:47,655 --> 01:18:48,969
Plague.

1076
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,444
You must leave. Now.

1077
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:01,529
<i>Quickly...</i>

1078
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:03,229
before it takes her, too.

1079
01:19:21,338 --> 01:19:24,398
I'm sorry I ever called your father
a thief.

1080
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:28,502
Let's go home.

1081
01:19:35,161 --> 01:19:36,850
It's just some storm, huh?

1082
01:19:37,051 --> 01:19:40,669
At least, we're not tied to a tree
in the middle of nowhere,

1083
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:42,784
surrounded by bloodthirsts
and wolves.

1084
01:19:43,185 --> 01:19:44,634
You know, it's not too late.

1085
01:19:44,835 --> 01:19:46,267
We could always turn back..

1086
01:19:48,718 --> 01:19:49,718
It's just..

1087
01:19:49,819 --> 01:19:51,933
everytime I close my eyes,

1088
01:19:52,133 --> 01:19:53,718
I picture Maurice stranded alone.

1089
01:19:53,919 --> 01:19:55,215
And when I open them,

1090
01:19:56,049 --> 01:19:57,086
he is..

1091
01:19:58,722 --> 01:20:00,391
Maurice?

1092
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,052
Gaston,

1093
01:20:04,254 --> 01:20:06,413
did you try to kill Maurice?

1094
01:20:09,808 --> 01:20:11,284
Maurice!

1095
01:20:11,484 --> 01:20:12,886
Thank heavens!

1096
01:20:13,505 --> 01:20:15,568
I've spent the last five days

1097
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:16,850
trying to find you!

1098
01:20:16,898 --> 01:20:17,898
You tried to kill me.

1099
01:20:17,998 --> 01:20:19,643
You left me to the wolves.

1100
01:20:19,944 --> 01:20:21,043
Wolves?

1101
01:20:21,344 --> 01:20:23,808
It's one thing to rave about
your delusions

1102
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:26,297
and another, to accuse me of
attempted murder.

1103
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:27,767
Maurice,

1104
01:20:28,142 --> 01:20:30,805
do you have any proof of
what you're saying?

1105
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:35,298
Ask Agathe. She rescued me.

1106
01:20:35,599 --> 01:20:37,012
Agathe!

1107
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,829
You'd hang your accusations
on the testimony

1108
01:20:41,031 --> 01:20:42,579
of a filthy hag?

1109
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,573
No offense, Agathe.

1110
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:48,730
Monsieur LeFou.

1111
01:20:49,267 --> 01:20:51,904
He was there. He saw it all.

1112
01:20:52,554 --> 01:20:53,554
Me?

1113
01:20:53,838 --> 01:20:55,279
You're right!

1114
01:20:55,479 --> 01:20:57,110
Don't take my word for it.

1115
01:20:57,711 --> 01:20:58,711
LeFou!

1116
01:21:00,012 --> 01:21:01,780
My dearest companion.

1117
01:21:01,981 --> 01:21:02,982
Did I,

1118
01:21:03,383 --> 01:21:06,382
your loyal friend and most loyal
compatriot,

1119
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:10,405
try to kill the father of the only woman
I've ever loved?

1120
01:21:10,606 --> 01:21:13,871
Well, it's a complicated question on a
number of accounts.

1121
01:21:15,857 --> 01:21:17,291
But, no.

1122
01:21:18,493 --> 01:21:19,587
No, he did not.

1123
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:21,980
You!

1124
01:21:29,249 --> 01:21:30,560
Maurice,

1125
01:21:31,557 --> 01:21:35,651
it pains me to say this, but you've become
a danger to yourself and others.

1126
01:21:35,852 --> 01:21:38,745
No wonder, Belle runaway.

1127
01:21:38,946 --> 01:21:40,508
You need a help, Sir.

1128
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:43,170
A place to heal your
troubled mind.

1129
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:48,248
Everything is gonna be fine.

1130
01:21:48,749 --> 01:21:49,749
Just fine.

1131
01:21:53,468 --> 01:21:54,628
Well, I'd saw her in the ballroom,

1132
01:21:54,763 --> 01:21:56,750
and said, "You're making everything
looks so beautiful,

1133
01:21:56,952 --> 01:22:00,697
we should have a dance tonight".
I never imagined she'd actually say yes.

1134
01:22:00,899 --> 01:22:01,899
What was I thinking?

1135
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:04,612
No, Master. It's perfect!

1136
01:22:04,813 --> 01:22:07,255
The rose has only four petals left,
which means tonight..

1137
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:09,378
You can tell her how you feel.

1138
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,362
I feel like a fool.

1139
01:22:12,443 --> 01:22:14,014
She will never love me.

1140
01:22:14,215 --> 01:22:15,358
Do not be discourage.

1141
01:22:16,981 --> 01:22:18,388
She is the one.

1142
01:22:18,632 --> 01:22:20,657
Please, stop saying that!

1143
01:22:22,266 --> 01:22:23,735
There is no "one".

1144
01:22:23,936 --> 01:22:25,313
You care for her, don't you?

1145
01:22:25,514 --> 01:22:29,913
Well then, woo her with beautiful music
and romantic candlelight.

1146
01:22:30,013 --> 01:22:33,061
Yes, and when the moments just right.
Hmhhm.

1147
01:22:33,647 --> 01:22:34,995
Well, how will I know?

1148
01:22:35,096 --> 01:22:36,539
You'll feel slightly nauseous.

1149
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:39,028
Don't worry, Master. You'll do fine.

1150
01:22:39,229 --> 01:22:43,616
Just don't be so nervous and
tell Belle how you feel.

1151
01:22:43,817 --> 01:22:45,018
Because if you dont,

1152
01:22:45,218 --> 01:22:48,065
I promise, you'll be drinking cold tea
for the rest of your days!

1153
01:22:48,266 --> 01:22:49,866
- In the dark.
- Covered in dust.

1154
01:22:50,068 --> 01:22:52,440
Dark and very, very dirty.

1155
01:22:53,567 --> 01:22:54,669
Start with the hair.

1156
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:56,350
Women love nice hair!

1157
01:22:56,679 --> 01:22:58,031
How tidy the fingers and toes?

1158
01:22:58,055 --> 01:23:01,204
Chapeau, brush those teeth.
They need it.

1159
01:23:01,405 --> 01:23:02,406
Deep, deep.

1160
01:23:02,608 --> 01:23:04,597
Snip, snip.

1161
01:23:05,585 --> 01:23:07,042
Polish the nails.

1162
01:23:07,343 --> 01:23:08,880
Shine the horn.

1163
01:23:09,081 --> 01:23:10,481
Eyes close. Puff, puff.

1164
01:23:10,725 --> 01:23:12,329
And to top final look.

1165
01:23:13,945 --> 01:23:15,281
Voilà!

1166
01:23:16,689 --> 01:23:19,374
Okay, I can fix this.

1167
01:23:28,715 --> 01:23:30,335
Oh, beautiful!

1168
01:23:30,581 --> 01:23:31,935
But something has missing.

1169
01:23:32,884 --> 01:23:34,959
Oh, yes!

1170
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:38,969
The finishing touch!

1171
01:24:43,926 --> 01:24:47,665
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1172
01:24:49,234 --> 01:24:52,892
<i>True as it can be</i>

1173
01:24:54,879 --> 01:24:57,454
<i>Barely even friends</i>

1174
01:24:57,755 --> 01:25:02,317
<i>Then somebody bends
unexpectedly</i>

1175
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:08,786
<i>Just a little change</i>

1176
01:25:10,691 --> 01:25:13,068
<i>Small, to say the least</i>

1177
01:25:13,788 --> 01:25:16,391
<i>Both a little scared</i>

1178
01:25:16,593 --> 01:25:18,551
<i>Neither one prepared</i>

1179
01:25:19,741 --> 01:25:23,890
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

1180
01:25:34,751 --> 01:25:37,345
<i>Ever just the same</i>

1181
01:25:41,327 --> 01:25:45,677
<i>Ever a surprise</i>

1182
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:50,881
<i>Ever as before</i>

1183
01:25:51,082 --> 01:25:54,198
<i>Ever just as sure</i>

1184
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:59,353
<i>As the sun will rise</i>

1185
01:26:01,388 --> 01:26:04,977
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1186
01:26:07,694 --> 01:26:11,741
<i>Tune as old as song</i>

1187
01:26:14,186 --> 01:26:16,573
<i>Bittersweet and strange</i>

1188
01:26:16,773 --> 01:26:19,532
<i>Finding you can change</i>

1189
01:26:19,834 --> 01:26:23,227
<i>Learning you were wrong</i>

1190
01:26:36,156 --> 01:26:39,923
<i>Certain as the sun</i>

1191
01:26:42,609 --> 01:26:45,428
<i>Rising in the east</i>

1192
01:26:45,629 --> 01:26:48,349
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1193
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:51,887
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

1194
01:26:52,188 --> 01:26:56,672
<i>Beauty and the beast.</i>

1195
01:26:58,569 --> 01:27:01,921
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1196
01:27:02,121 --> 01:27:05,165
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

1197
01:27:06,663 --> 01:27:12,531
<i>Beauty and the beast.</i>

1198
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:31,897
I hadn't dance in years.

1199
01:27:33,107 --> 01:27:35,087
I almost forgot how to feel it.

1200
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,145
It's foolish, I suppose,

1201
01:27:48,145 --> 01:27:50,833
for a creature like me, to hope..

1202
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:53,861
that one day he might earn
your affection.

1203
01:27:55,223 --> 01:27:56,554
I don't know.

1204
01:27:56,755 --> 01:27:58,152
Really?

1205
01:27:59,514 --> 01:28:01,371
You think you could be happy here?

1206
01:28:06,744 --> 01:28:09,442
Can anybody be happy
if they're free?

1207
01:28:19,577 --> 01:28:21,052
My father taught me to dance.

1208
01:28:22,901 --> 01:28:24,484
I used to step on his toes
a lot.

1209
01:28:28,093 --> 01:28:30,139
You must miss him.

1210
01:28:32,627 --> 01:28:33,678
Very much.

1211
01:28:40,773 --> 01:28:42,593
Would you like to see him?

1212
01:28:51,363 --> 01:28:53,383
I'd like to see my father.

1213
01:28:56,980 --> 01:28:58,082
Papa!

1214
01:28:59,865 --> 01:29:01,611
What are they doing to him?

1215
01:29:01,812 --> 01:29:03,351
He.. He's in trouble!

1216
01:29:04,699 --> 01:29:05,983
Then you must go to him.

1217
01:29:08,668 --> 01:29:09,668
What did you say?

1218
01:29:11,139 --> 01:29:13,048
You must go to him.

1219
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:16,147
No time to waste.

1220
01:29:21,799 --> 01:29:22,613
No.

1221
01:29:22,814 --> 01:29:24,313
You keep it with you.

1222
01:29:26,463 --> 01:29:29,151
And you'll always have a way
to look back on me.

1223
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:36,108
Thank you.

1224
01:30:21,729 --> 01:30:24,290
Well, Master, I have had my doubts,
but everything's moving like clockwork.

1225
01:30:24,892 --> 01:30:27,435
True love really does win the day!

1226
01:30:30,318 --> 01:30:31,738
I let her go.

1227
01:30:32,039 --> 01:30:33,629
What?

1228
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:35,645
Master, how could you do that?

1229
01:30:35,845 --> 01:30:37,752
I had to.

1230
01:30:38,353 --> 01:30:39,353
But, why?

1231
01:30:39,529 --> 01:30:41,394
Because, he loves her.

1232
01:30:41,996 --> 01:30:43,483
Then, why are we not human?

1233
01:30:43,683 --> 01:30:47,115
Because, she doesn't love him.
And now, it's too late.

1234
01:30:47,315 --> 01:30:49,111
But she might still come back.

1235
01:30:49,412 --> 01:30:50,946
No.

1236
01:30:51,547 --> 01:30:52,845
I set her free.

1237
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:57,270
I'm sorry I couldn't do the same
for all of you.

1238
01:30:57,571 --> 01:30:59,050
Now, go.

1239
01:30:59,251 --> 01:31:01,386
Our time has so much passed.

1240
01:31:05,978 --> 01:31:07,242
Go, my love.

1241
01:31:10,321 --> 01:31:13,544
<i>I was the one who had it all</i>

1242
01:31:15,084 --> 01:31:17,982
<i>I was the master of my fate</i>

1243
01:31:19,865 --> 01:31:24,286
<i>I never needed anybody in my life</i>

1244
01:31:24,587 --> 01:31:28,202
<i>I learnt the truth too late</i>

1245
01:31:29,312 --> 01:31:32,621
<i>I'll never shake away the pain</i>

1246
01:31:33,819 --> 01:31:37,490
<i>I close my eyes but
she's still there</i>

1247
01:31:38,577 --> 01:31:42,839
<i>I let her steal into my melancholy heart</i>

1248
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:46,710
<i>It's more than I can bear</i>

1249
01:31:49,834 --> 01:31:54,900
<i>Now I know she'll never leave me</i>

1250
01:31:55,201 --> 01:31:59,600
<i>Even as she runs away</i>

1251
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:04,383
<i>She will still torment me
Calm me, hurt me</i>

1252
01:32:04,585 --> 01:32:07,820
<i>Move me, come what may</i>

1253
01:32:09,769 --> 01:32:13,419
<i>Wasting in my lonely tower</i>

1254
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:17,528
<i>Waiting by an open door</i>

1255
01:32:18,965 --> 01:32:22,160
<i>I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in</i>

1256
01:32:24,065 --> 01:32:28,195
<i>And be with me forevermore</i>

1257
01:32:30,993 --> 01:32:34,159
<i>I rage against the trials of love</i>

1258
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:38,130
<i>I curse the fading of the light</i>

1259
01:32:40,049 --> 01:32:43,733
<i>Though she's already flown so far
beyond my reach</i>

1260
01:32:44,573 --> 01:32:50,485
<i>She's never out of sight</i>

1261
01:32:50,686 --> 01:32:54,997
<i>Now I know she'll never leave me</i>

1262
01:32:55,998 --> 01:33:00,645
<i>Even as she fades from view</i>

1263
01:33:00,846 --> 01:33:02,694
<i>She will still inspire me</i>

1264
01:33:02,894 --> 01:33:08,419
<i>Be a part of everything I do</i>

1265
01:33:09,477 --> 01:33:13,401
<i>Wasting in my lonely tower</i>

1266
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:17,441
<i>Waiting by an open door</i>

1267
01:33:19,001 --> 01:33:22,149
<i>I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in</i>

1268
01:33:23,351 --> 01:33:26,358
<i>And as the long, long nights begin</i>

1269
01:33:27,741 --> 01:33:30,922
<i>I'll think of all that might have been</i>

1270
01:33:31,896 --> 01:33:38,737
<i>Waiting here forevermore</i>

1271
01:34:00,456 --> 01:34:01,456
This man is weak, please!

1272
01:34:01,858 --> 01:34:03,337
He needs a hospital.

1273
01:34:03,839 --> 01:34:04,839
Not an assylum!

1274
01:34:08,151 --> 01:34:11,167
Have you ever see the inside
of a mad house, Maurice?

1275
01:34:11,562 --> 01:34:13,102
You wouldn't last a week.

1276
01:34:13,304 --> 01:34:15,399
Just give me your daughter's hands,
and I'll set you free.

1277
01:34:15,799 --> 01:34:16,799
Never.

1278
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:21,348
Take him away!

1279
01:34:29,755 --> 01:34:30,755
Stop!

1280
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:44,428
Papa!

1281
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:46,074
Ah, Belle. I thought I'd lost you.

1282
01:34:46,274 --> 01:34:48,339
Let him out! He's hurt!

1283
01:34:48,541 --> 01:34:51,246
We can't do that, Miss.
We will take good care of him.

1284
01:34:51,647 --> 01:34:53,362
My father's not crazy!

1285
01:34:53,562 --> 01:34:55,047
Gaston, tell him!

1286
01:34:55,248 --> 01:34:56,932
You know how loyal I am
to your family,

1287
01:34:57,133 --> 01:34:59,873
but your father's been making
some unbelievable claims.

1288
01:35:00,174 --> 01:35:01,742
It's true, Belle.

1289
01:35:01,943 --> 01:35:04,035
He's been raging about a beast

1290
01:35:04,236 --> 01:35:05,289
in a castle!

1291
01:35:05,488 --> 01:35:08,125
I've just come from the castle
and there is a beast!

1292
01:35:08,327 --> 01:35:11,296
You'd say anything to set him free.
Your word is hardly prove!

1293
01:35:11,597 --> 01:35:13,130
You want a proof?

1294
01:35:15,012 --> 01:35:16,774
Show me the Beast!

1295
01:35:26,568 --> 01:35:27,856
That's your proof!

1296
01:35:29,386 --> 01:35:30,490
This is sorcery!

1297
01:35:33,114 --> 01:35:35,385
Look at this beast!

1298
01:35:35,587 --> 01:35:36,922
Look at his face!

1299
01:35:37,924 --> 01:35:39,235
His claws!

1300
01:35:39,536 --> 01:35:41,768
No, no, don't be afraid!

1301
01:35:42,085 --> 01:35:45,188
He's gentle and kind.

1302
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,954
The monster has her under a spell!

1303
01:35:49,232 --> 01:35:53,024
If I didn't know better, I'd say
she even cared for him!

1304
01:35:53,325 --> 01:35:55,381
He's not a monster, Gaston!

1305
01:35:55,481 --> 01:35:56,481
You are!

1306
01:35:58,329 --> 01:35:59,811
The Beast wouldn't hurt anyone.

1307
01:36:00,112 --> 01:36:01,903
I've heard the effect of
dark magic,

1308
01:36:02,003 --> 01:36:04,849
but I've never before see it with
my own eyes!

1309
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:06,050
This is a threat

1310
01:36:06,164 --> 01:36:07,463
to our very existence!

1311
01:36:09,012 --> 01:36:10,012
We can't have her running out

1312
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:11,523
to warn the Beast.

1313
01:36:11,631 --> 01:36:12,711
Lock her up, too.

1314
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:14,168
- No!
- Lock her away!

1315
01:36:14,569 --> 01:36:15,598
- No!
- Shut up!

1316
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:17,020
You won't get away with this, Gaston!

1317
01:36:17,673 --> 01:36:18,935
Oh, Belle.

1318
01:36:20,588 --> 01:36:22,558
Gaston, with all due respect..

1319
01:36:22,759 --> 01:36:24,219
Do you want to be next?

1320
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:26,624
Fetch my horse.

1321
01:36:26,826 --> 01:36:28,041
Stand guard!

1322
01:36:28,241 --> 01:36:29,297
Don't let them escape!

1323
01:36:29,498 --> 01:36:31,992
This creature will curse us all
if we don't stop him!

1324
01:36:33,827 --> 01:36:36,299
What I say, we kill the beast!

1325
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:37,574
Kill the beast!

1326
01:36:40,315 --> 01:36:41,705
<i>We're not safe until he's dead</i>

1327
01:36:41,905 --> 01:36:43,500
<i>He'll come stalking us at night</i>

1328
01:36:43,701 --> 01:36:46,748
<i>Set to sacrifice our children to his
monstrous appetite</i>

1329
01:36:47,048 --> 01:36:50,181
<i>He'll wreak havoc on our village
if we let him wander free</i>

1330
01:36:50,382 --> 01:36:53,739
<i>So it's time to take some action, boys</i>

1331
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:59,158
<i>It's time to follow me</i>

1332
01:37:00,906 --> 01:37:03,252
<i>Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows</i>

1333
01:37:03,453 --> 01:37:06,717
<i>It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride</i>

1334
01:37:06,919 --> 01:37:10,527
<i>Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle</i>

1335
01:37:10,729 --> 01:37:14,105
<i>And there's something truly terrible inside</i>

1336
01:37:14,207 --> 01:37:16,897
<i>It's a beast, he's got fangs
Razor sharp ones</i>

1337
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:19,999
<i>Massive paws, killer claws for the feast</i>

1338
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:21,746
<i>Hear him roar, see him roam</i>

1339
01:37:22,047 --> 01:37:25,424
<i>But we're not coming home
'Til he's dead</i>

1340
01:37:25,625 --> 01:37:26,724
<i>Good and dead!</i>

1341
01:37:27,225 --> 01:37:28,225
<i>Kill the beast!</i>

1342
01:37:30,686 --> 01:37:32,084
<i>Light your torch, mount your horse</i>

1343
01:37:32,285 --> 01:37:34,032
<i>Screw your courage to the sticking place</i>

1344
01:37:34,234 --> 01:37:37,134
<i>We're counting on Gaston to lead the way</i>

1345
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:40,535
<i>Call it war, call it threat
You can bet they all will follow</i>

1346
01:37:40,736 --> 01:37:43,701
<i>For in times like this,
they'll do just as I say</i>

1347
01:37:44,001 --> 01:37:47,224
<i>There's a beast running wild,
there's no question</i>

1348
01:37:47,425 --> 01:37:50,541
<i>But I fear the wrong monster's
released</i>

1349
01:37:50,643 --> 01:37:53,876
<i>Sally forth! Tally ho!
Grab your sword! Grab your bow!</i>

1350
01:37:54,177 --> 01:37:58,440
<i>Praise the Lord and here we go!</i>

1351
01:38:01,858 --> 01:38:03,322
Show me the castle!

1352
01:38:05,834 --> 01:38:07,538
At least, they've finally learnt to love.

1353
01:38:07,839 --> 01:38:10,665
It'd be better for us,
if she does love him in return.

1354
01:38:10,866 --> 01:38:15,272
No, this is the first time of
at any real hope, she would.

1355
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:16,880
Did you hear that, Mama?

1356
01:38:17,081 --> 01:38:18,441
Is it her? Is she coming back?

1357
01:38:18,642 --> 01:38:19,842
Could it be?

1358
01:38:20,143 --> 01:38:21,524
I told you!

1359
01:38:21,924 --> 01:38:23,003
Sacré bleu!

1360
01:38:23,403 --> 01:38:24,403
Invaders!

1361
01:38:24,507 --> 01:38:25,805
Rufianes!

1362
01:38:26,005 --> 01:38:27,661
Well, where do you go?

1363
01:38:27,962 --> 01:38:29,816
So much for true love.

1364
01:38:30,018 --> 01:38:31,811
Frame the barricades!

1365
01:38:32,112 --> 01:38:34,609
And oppose!

1366
01:38:34,810 --> 01:38:36,025
Move aside!

1367
01:38:36,227 --> 01:38:39,225
<i>Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle</i>

1368
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:42,255
<i>Unafraid although the danger's just
increased</i>

1369
01:38:44,092 --> 01:38:47,364
<i>Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come, we're fifty strong</i>

1370
01:38:47,565 --> 01:38:50,103
<i>And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong</i>

1371
01:38:50,903 --> 01:38:52,148
<i>Let's kill the Beast!</i>

1372
01:38:55,292 --> 01:38:56,569
We need help.

1373
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:01,385
I have to warn the Beast.

1374
01:39:01,586 --> 01:39:02,586
Warn him?

1375
01:39:02,748 --> 01:39:04,619
How did you get away from him?

1376
01:39:06,115 --> 01:39:07,915
He let me go, Papa.

1377
01:39:08,688 --> 01:39:10,272
He sent me back to you.

1378
01:39:11,083 --> 01:39:12,314
I don't understand.

1379
01:39:18,524 --> 01:39:19,985
Where did you..?

1380
01:39:20,112 --> 01:39:22,333
He took me there.

1381
01:39:25,697 --> 01:39:28,086
I know what happened to mama.

1382
01:39:28,559 --> 01:39:31,979
Then you know why I had to leave her there.

1383
01:39:32,179 --> 01:39:35,324
I had to protect you. I.. I've always
tried to protect my little girl.

1384
01:39:35,524 --> 01:39:36,932
Probably, too much.

1385
01:39:37,863 --> 01:39:39,547
I understand.

1386
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:48,813
Will you help me now?

1387
01:39:49,015 --> 01:39:50,685
It's dangerous.

1388
01:39:50,886 --> 01:39:52,187
Yes!

1389
01:39:52,788 --> 01:39:54,017
Yes, it is.

1390
01:39:57,616 --> 01:39:59,361
I could try to pick the lock.

1391
01:40:00,306 --> 01:40:01,307
After all,

1392
01:40:01,507 --> 01:40:05,251
it's, it's only gears and springs.

1393
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,630
But I would need

1394
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:12,413
something long and sharp.

1395
01:40:13,799 --> 01:40:14,799
Like that.

1396
01:40:15,289 --> 01:40:16,289
Perfect.

1397
01:40:20,828 --> 01:40:22,244
Oh, excuse me, Master.

1398
01:40:22,444 --> 01:40:24,081
I'm sorry to disturb you.

1399
01:40:24,282 --> 01:40:25,838
She's not coming back.

1400
01:40:26,818 --> 01:40:27,858
No.

1401
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:30,016
They're breaking down the doors.

1402
01:40:30,917 --> 01:40:32,615
Doesn't matter now.

1403
01:40:32,816 --> 01:40:35,241
Just let them come.

1404
01:40:35,542 --> 01:40:38,091
<i>Kill the beast!</i>

1405
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:39,677
This isn't working.

1406
01:40:39,878 --> 01:40:40,994
I know what to do.

1407
01:40:41,194 --> 01:40:45,463
<i>Kill the beast! Kill the beast!
Kill the beast!</i>

1408
01:40:53,194 --> 01:40:55,145
Are you not at least be concerned

1409
01:40:55,346 --> 01:40:57,208
that this castle might be haunted?

1410
01:40:58,706 --> 01:41:01,040
Don't lose your nerve, LeFou.

1411
01:41:01,641 --> 01:41:02,641
Where are we?

1412
01:41:04,018 --> 01:41:08,055
This place seems familiar.

1413
01:41:08,256 --> 01:41:10,163
Like I've been here before.

1414
01:41:13,153 --> 01:41:14,383
Oh, hello there.

1415
01:41:15,033 --> 01:41:16,033
You must be

1416
01:41:16,128 --> 01:41:17,805
the talking teacup.

1417
01:41:18,647 --> 01:41:19,690
And you must be

1418
01:41:19,790 --> 01:41:21,048
his grandmother.

1419
01:41:21,726 --> 01:41:23,026
Grandmother?

1420
01:41:23,227 --> 01:41:24,227
Attack!

1421
01:41:25,851 --> 01:41:26,851
Oh, hallo!

1422
01:41:42,068 --> 01:41:43,273
Gaston!

1423
01:41:47,254 --> 01:41:48,293
Gaston!

1424
01:41:48,692 --> 01:41:49,692
Help me.

1425
01:41:49,792 --> 01:41:51,095
Sorry, old friend.

1426
01:41:51,695 --> 01:41:53,307
It's hero time.

1427
01:42:13,581 --> 01:42:14,581
Hello.

1428
01:42:16,692 --> 01:42:17,810
Oh, uh, I believe this is yours.

1429
01:42:24,307 --> 01:42:25,353
She is very headstrong.

1430
01:42:27,453 --> 01:42:28,488
Do you have children?

1431
01:42:32,252 --> 01:42:35,141
No one to protect you now, huh?

1432
01:42:44,089 --> 01:42:46,408
One, two, three, four,

1433
01:42:46,608 --> 01:42:48,655
five, six, seven, eight.

1434
01:42:48,956 --> 01:42:50,156
Good shot, Chip, my boy!

1435
01:42:51,859 --> 01:42:52,859
Ha ha!
Excellent!

1436
01:42:52,906 --> 01:42:54,001
The infantery's arrived!

1437
01:42:55,358 --> 01:42:57,551
Now, go and teach some lessons.
Go!

1438
01:42:58,819 --> 01:43:02,411
Yes, those are called books,
you low-grade musketeers!

1439
01:43:04,999 --> 01:43:06,533
Oh! I'm off.

1440
01:43:13,834 --> 01:43:14,988
Just a clock.

1441
01:43:16,428 --> 01:43:17,428
Ha ha. Come here,

1442
01:43:17,663 --> 01:43:18,863
little boys.

1443
01:43:19,464 --> 01:43:21,461
***

1444
01:43:21,761 --> 01:43:25,111
Yes, pretty little boys. Yes!

1445
01:43:26,665 --> 01:43:28,247
Beautiful!

1446
01:43:28,447 --> 01:43:30,166
Go! Be free!

1447
01:43:30,367 --> 01:43:31,853
Be free! Be free!

1448
01:43:44,925 --> 01:43:46,210
How do you like your tea?

1449
01:43:46,412 --> 01:43:47,412
Hot enough?

1450
01:43:48,633 --> 01:43:49,918
Or boiling?

1451
01:43:51,842 --> 01:43:53,271
Mr. Potts!

1452
01:43:56,226 --> 01:43:57,226
Mama!

1453
01:43:59,559 --> 01:44:00,559
Thank you!

1454
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:04,921
Take my guts!

1455
01:44:06,183 --> 01:44:07,587
Nicely handled!

1456
01:44:07,787 --> 01:44:09,283
Well, I used to be on Gaston's side,

1457
01:44:09,572 --> 01:44:11,197
but we are so in a bad place
right now.

1458
01:44:11,498 --> 01:44:12,719
You're too good for him,
anyway.

1459
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:13,721
Yeah.

1460
01:44:13,923 --> 01:44:15,139
Should we get back to it then?

1461
01:44:18,782 --> 01:44:19,995
The sweet of music!

1462
01:44:20,196 --> 01:44:21,196

1464
01:44:23,205 --> 01:44:24,205
What?

1465
01:44:24,306 --> 01:44:25,306
Maestro!

1466
01:44:25,406 --> 01:44:26,806
Darling! I've lost!

1467
01:44:27,008 --> 01:44:28,893
I'm coming, my love!

1468
01:44:29,094 --> 01:44:30,794
This is it!

1469
01:44:30,995 --> 01:44:34,162
The fat lady is singing!

1470
01:44:46,297 --> 01:44:47,725
Watch your toes!

1471
01:44:51,533 --> 01:44:53,547
That's it! Go! Go!

1472
01:44:54,147 --> 01:44:55,747
Bon voyage!

1473

***

1474
01:45:02,487 --> 01:45:04,089
Hands stay out!

1475
01:45:24,383 --> 01:45:25,383
Hello, Beast!

1476
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:30,686
I'm Gaston.

1477
01:45:31,556 --> 01:45:33,168
Belle sent me.

1478
01:45:35,916 --> 01:45:38,108
Were you in love with her?

1479
01:45:40,187 --> 01:45:42,878
Did you honestly think she'd want you?

1480
01:45:58,578 --> 01:45:59,578
Belle!

1481
01:46:01,225 --> 01:46:02,279
Where is he?

1482
01:46:03,341 --> 01:46:04,755
When we return to the village,

1483
01:46:04,956 --> 01:46:06,619
you will marry me!

1484
01:46:06,821 --> 01:46:08,331
And that beast's head

1485
01:46:08,532 --> 01:46:10,379
- will hang on our wall.
- Never!

1486
01:46:26,441 --> 01:46:28,038
I'm telling you, Beast!

1487
01:46:49,188 --> 01:46:50,188
No!

1488
01:46:50,461 --> 01:46:51,661
Belle?

1489
01:46:56,099 --> 01:46:57,099
Belle!

1490
01:46:58,454 --> 01:46:59,454
You came back!

1491
01:46:59,695 --> 01:47:01,310
I tried to stop them!

1492
01:47:01,511 --> 01:47:02,511
Stay there!

1493
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:04,170
I'm coming!

1494
01:47:31,310 --> 01:47:32,619
Gaston!

1495
01:47:32,819 --> 01:47:33,919
No!

1496
01:47:47,877 --> 01:47:49,606
Don't let me go.

1497
01:47:50,207 --> 01:47:51,373
Please.

1498
01:47:51,774 --> 01:47:53,181
I'll do anything.

1499
01:47:53,382 --> 01:47:54,783
Don't let me, Beast.

1500
01:48:04,134 --> 01:48:05,688
I am not

1501
01:48:05,890 --> 01:48:07,476
the beast.

1502
01:48:14,110 --> 01:48:15,407
Go!

1503
01:48:16,608 --> 01:48:18,324
Get out!

1504
01:48:19,736 --> 01:48:20,736
Don't!

1505
01:48:20,990 --> 01:48:22,089
It's too far!

1506
01:48:38,359 --> 01:48:39,398
Please!

1507
01:48:42,937 --> 01:48:43,937
Come on.

1508
01:49:13,618 --> 01:49:14,846
You came back.

1509
01:49:16,217 --> 01:49:17,989
Of course, I came back.

1510
01:49:18,192 --> 01:49:19,577
I'll never leave you again.

1511
01:49:20,478 --> 01:49:22,509
I'm afraid it's my turn to leave.

1512
01:49:22,709 --> 01:49:24,110
We're together now.

1513
01:49:24,910 --> 01:49:26,389
It's gonna be fine.

1514
01:49:26,790 --> 01:49:28,947
At least I could see you.

1515
01:49:29,348 --> 01:49:31,298
One last time.

1516
01:49:36,466 --> 01:49:37,805
No!

1517
01:49:38,005 --> 01:49:39,306
Please, no!

1518
01:49:42,595 --> 01:49:44,139
Come back!

1519
01:49:51,562 --> 01:49:53,286
We did it, Plumette!

1520
01:49:53,487 --> 01:49:55,604
Victory is ours!

1521
01:49:56,845 --> 01:49:58,304
Plumette?

1522
01:49:58,984 --> 01:50:00,383
Plumette?

1523
01:50:01,335 --> 01:50:03,706
Oh, my darling, Plumette.

1524
01:50:04,937 --> 01:50:06,191
Oh, no.

1525
01:50:06,854 --> 01:50:09,819
Maestro, you were so brave.

1526
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:12,677
Goodbye, my love.

1527
01:50:14,277 --> 01:50:15,377
Amore!

1528
01:50:15,577 --> 01:50:18,389
No! Don't leave me!

1529
01:50:37,973 --> 01:50:38,973
Chip!

1530
01:50:39,774 --> 01:50:40,553
Chip!

1531
01:50:40,754 --> 01:50:43,292
Have you seen Chip?
He ran off.

1532
01:50:46,185 --> 01:50:48,449
Where is my little boy?

1533
01:50:52,598 --> 01:50:54,156
- Mama!
- Oh, no!

1534
01:50:54,357 --> 01:50:55,996
Mam!

1535
01:51:12,442 --> 01:51:13,535
Lumière,

1536
01:51:14,423 --> 01:51:15,423
I, I can't

1537
01:51:15,564 --> 01:51:16,564
speak.

1538
01:51:16,966 --> 01:51:18,157
It's all right, Cogsworth.

1539
01:51:18,359 --> 01:51:19,405
I can't..

1540
01:51:19,859 --> 01:51:20,900
Lumière,

1541
01:51:21,501 --> 01:51:22,602
my friend.

1542
01:51:22,802 --> 01:51:24,736
It was an honor to serve

1543
01:51:25,038 --> 01:51:26,127
with you.

1544
01:51:28,662 --> 01:51:31,262
The honor was mine.

1545
01:51:59,321 --> 01:52:00,321
Come back!

1546
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:02,117
Please, don't leave me!

1547
01:52:05,319 --> 01:52:07,421
I love you.

1548
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:25,122
Maestro!

1549
01:54:30,368 --> 01:54:31,628
Madame!

1550
01:54:32,126 --> 01:54:33,521
Maestro!

1551
01:54:52,348 --> 01:54:53,823
Lumière!

1552
01:54:55,115 --> 01:54:57,557
Cogsworth, we beat the clock!

1553
01:55:01,825 --> 01:55:02,827
Plumette!

1554
01:55:04,317 --> 01:55:06,308
Plumette!

1555
01:55:08,838 --> 01:55:10,027
Oh, mon amor!

1556
01:55:32,666 --> 01:55:34,579
Chip! Look at you!

1557
01:55:35,245 --> 01:55:36,700
You're a little boy again!

1558
01:55:37,001 --> 01:55:39,052
What did I tell you, darling?

1559
01:55:39,193 --> 01:55:40,840
Ohh.. You smell so good.

1560
01:55:48,790 --> 01:55:49,825
Froufrou, lamer!

1561
01:55:51,615 --> 01:55:52,659
Darling?

1562
01:55:53,787 --> 01:55:54,792
Mr. Potts!

1563
01:55:54,994 --> 01:55:55,794
Beatrice!

1564
01:55:55,995 --> 01:55:56,995
I remember!

1565
01:55:57,295 --> 01:55:58,295
I do!

1566
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:05,291
Henry?

1567
01:56:06,291 --> 01:56:07,065
Henry!

1568
01:56:07,265 --> 01:56:08,766
Oh, dear.

1569
01:56:11,936 --> 01:56:13,564
I've been so lonely.

1570
01:56:13,765 --> 01:56:15,466
Turn back into a clock.

1571
01:56:15,807 --> 01:56:17,136
Turn back into a clock.

1572
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:20,514
Lumière, look!

1573
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:24,580
My Prince!

1574
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:28,674
Hello, old friend.

1575
01:56:28,975 --> 01:56:30,076
It's so good to see you.

1576
01:56:30,277 --> 01:56:31,988
You saved our lives, mademoiselle.

1577
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:33,553
Belle! It's me!

1578
01:56:33,855 --> 01:56:35,207
It's Chip!

How would you feel about
growing a beard?
