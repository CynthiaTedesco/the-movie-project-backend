the feel of real. X1.</i></font>

261
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The X1 is like wearing a second skin.</i></font>

262
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A skin that kicks ass.</i></font>

263
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I zeroed out 'cause
of your broke-ass gloves.</font>

264
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who told you to use them?</font>

265
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You took hers.</font>

266
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you lost a death match.</font>

267
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you just respawn
and level up like everyone else?</font>

268
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't get it.</font>

269
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bought all these power-ups
for this challenge, and I lost it all.</font>

270
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That artifact
was gonna pay for the house!</font>

271
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

272
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much of our house money
did you spend on upgrades?</font>

273
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, all of it, but I was gonna win.</font>

274
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was our ticket out of here.</font>

275
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You idiot.</font>

276
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, but I only lost 'cause
of the bad gloves.</font>

277
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our house! Our goddamn house!</font>

278
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My boys were in that challenge.</font>

279
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You couldn't have beat them
in a bootsuit, you noob.</font>

280
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop! No! No!</font>

281
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:24,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice, call the police!</font>

282
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we are not calling the cops.</font>

283
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to your room, Rick.</font>

284
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Alice.</font>

285
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you put up with this guy?
He's a shitshow.</font>

286
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:39,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ought to kick the both of you out.
I swear to G-O-D, Wade Watts,</font>

287
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if I catch you touching my stuff again,</font>

288
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not joking... Out.</font>

289
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Wade Watts."</i></font>

290
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My dad picked that name</i></font>

291
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>because it sounded
like a superhero's alter ego,</i></font>

292
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>like Peter Parker or Bruce Banner.</i></font>

293
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But he died when I was a kid.</i></font>

294
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My mom, too, and I ended up here,</i></font>

295
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>living with Aunt Alice</i></font>

296
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and her endless string
of hard-loving losers.</i></font>

297
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Halliday hated making rules."</i></font>

298
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Why is that line sticking in my head?</i></font>

299
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Maybe it's 'cause Art3mis said it,
and she's hot.</i></font>

300
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Maybe it's because she called me out,</i></font>

301
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>sitting here
in my tiny corner of nowhere,</i></font>

302
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>protecting my small slice of nothing.</i></font>

303
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Or maybe...</i></font>

304
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Maybe it's because
that line means something</i></font>

305
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and I missed it.</i></font>

306
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The day the contest was announced,
the Halliday Journals appeared.</i></font>

307
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He told us to look in his brain.
This was the next best thing.</i></font>

308
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>At first, it was jammed
with gunters looking for answers.</i></font>

309
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Now, the once-crowded halls
of Halliday's memories</i></font>

310
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>are left to people like me.</i></font>

311
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Parzival. Oh, joy!</font>

312
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how will you eat up
my valuable search time today?</font>

313
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gregarious Games, 2029... Office party.</font>

314
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Office party. Yes, you've only seen it
a thousand times.</font>

315
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not go back?</font>

316
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:15,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Each entry into Halliday's Journals
is meticulously assembled</font>

317
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from personal photographs,
home video recordings,</font>

318
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">surveillance, and nanny cams.</font>

319
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:23,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All rendered into a
3-dimensional virtual experience.</font>

320
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, Halliday archived every film,
game, book, and television program</font>

321
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he ever saw, located on the mezzanine.</font>

322
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No weapons or mature-themed avatars
are permitted within the Journals.</font>

323
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please enjoy your time with us,
and happy gunting!</font>

324
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like cleaning up.</font>

325
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Jim, I'm going.</font>

326
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything changes, Jim.
Everything evolves.</font>

327
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some things are perfect
just the way they are<i>. Asteroids.</i></font>

328
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People don't live inside
an <i>Asteroids</i> arcade cabinet.</font>

329
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that.</font>

330
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, people are living inside
the arcade we built.</font>

331
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I built.
- Uh, well...</font>

332
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Well, I guess you can say
whatever you want.</font>

333
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't really wanna
talk about it anymore.</font>

334
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, of course
you don't wanna talk about it.</font>

335
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:11,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're forcing me out.</font>

336
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:13,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Closer on Halliday.</font>

337
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, invention
comes with responsibilities</font>

338
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you didn't ask for.</font>

339
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, if you make something
people want or need</font>

340
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then it's up to you to set the limits.
You have to make some rules.</font>

341
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I don't wanna make any more rules."</font>

342
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't wanna make any more rules.</font>

343
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I'm a dreamer."</font>

344
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a dreamer.</font>

345
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I build worlds.
- "I build worlds."</font>

346
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We created something beautiful, Jim,
but it's changed.</font>

347
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? It's really not a game anymore.</font>

348
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we finished?</font>

349
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I liked how things were
when they were...</font>

350
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When it was a game.</font>

351
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we're back to where we started.
But that's the point, isn't it?</font>

352
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things move forward
whether you like it or not.</font>

353
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we're finished.</font>

354
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

355
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:01,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can't we go backwards,
for once?</font>

356
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:07,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Backwards, really fast.
Fast as we can.</font>

357
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really put the pedal to the metal,
you know?</font>

358
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go back 10 seconds!</font>

359
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can't we go backwards, for once?</font>

360
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:21,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Backwards, really fast.
Fast as we can.</font>

361
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really put the pedal to the metal,
you know?</font>

362
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bill and Ted did it.</font>

363
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back again so soon?</font>

364
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful not to lose your shit.</font>

365
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You figured something out.</font>

366
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Parzival, tell me.</font>

367
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice racing, Padawan.
You're the first to finish.</font>

368
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:52,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Halliday... Anorak.</font>

369
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's such an honor.</font>

370
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The honor is all mine.</font>

371
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get yourself a clue.</font>

372
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is this Parzival,
and how the hell is he winning?</font>

373
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, here's a better question.
Who cares?</font>

374
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Halliday's contest is vitally important.</font>

375
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it's nothing less than a war
for control of the future.</font>

376
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this Parzival?
He's not even clanned up.</font>

377
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's alone. We have an army.</font>

378
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yet,
he's got the first key.</font>

379
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he has a key,</font>

380
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you have to get 3 of 'em
to win the contest.</font>

381
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our stock dove 6% yesterday.</font>

382
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:56,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loyalty division is reporting
profits of 28%. F'Nale.</font>

383
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're opening
5 new loyalty centers this month.</font>

384
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Debt Services dwarfs Hardware.</font>

385
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you really wanna talk to me
about stock prices?</font>

386
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The shareholders won't be happy.</font>

387
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not our job to make them happy.
It's our job to make them money,</font>

388
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:12,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but once we launch this little baby,
they're gonna flip.</font>

389
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:16,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We call this Pure O2.</font>

390
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the first
of our planned upgrades.</font>

391
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once we can roll back
some of Halliday's ad restrictions,</font>

392
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we estimate we can sell up to 80%</font>

inducing seizures, so picture this...</font>

394
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of this implies we win the contest.</font>

395
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indeed, it does.</font>

396
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, you won the key and 100,000 coins?</font>

397
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As soon as I took the key,</font>

398
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:45,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all the coins
just appeared in my account.</font>

399
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you what,
I'm soiling my haptics right now.</font>

400
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell's a Cataclyst?</font>

401
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:58,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A bomb. Kills every avatar on a planet,
even the owner.</font>

402
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who'd want that?</font>

403
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">IOI. They buy everything.</font>

404
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">20-thou for the holy hand grenade?</font>

405
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a steal!</font>

406
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! Zemeckis Cube!
I need one of those.</font>

407
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, don't spend all your money.</font>

408
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">X1 haptic bootsuit.</font>

409
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah!</font>

410
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">i-R0k, old friend. How are you?</font>

411
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be honest,
I have kind of a neck thing.</font>

412
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a carpel-tunnel deal</font>

413
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but with your neck,
if that's even a thing.</font>

414
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So if you could just stand
to your right.</font>

415
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My right, your left.</font>

416
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:50,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, it's the repetitive stress.
Oh.</font>

417
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here he is.</font>

418
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:58,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The steampunk pirate king.
I knew him well, Sorrento.</font>

419
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are only 3 things
in this world I hate,</font>

420
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:05,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">steampunk, pirates, and tabbouleh.</font>

421
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, why do they even have it?</font>

422
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there a reason we're meeting here?</font>

423
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:15,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Nolan. The Orb of Osuvox.</font>

424
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanted it. He had it.
And so here it is.</font>

425
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:27,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It creates an impenetrable magic shield
that can only be taken down</font>

426
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by a magic spell.</font>

427
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Orb of Osuvox.</font>

428
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't say that again.</font>

429
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

430
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:40,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I'm gonna need you
to keep this for now.</font>

431
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna let you know
when I wanna use it.</font>

432
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

433
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:51,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now, though,
I have another job for you.</font>

434
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>

435
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Parzival.</font>

436
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me guess,
you want him off the scoreboard.</font>

437
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you do that?</font>

438
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he's a superstar.</font>

439
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He made it through the first gate</font>

440
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and avatars are gonna be on him
like hoes on Santa.</font>

441
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">i-R0k, how much more do you want?</font>

442
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I like about you, Nolan.
You never lick.</font>

443
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bite straight
to the chocolaty center</font>

444
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the Tootsie Pop.</font>

445
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember that old commercial,
with the owl?</font>

446
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">i-R0k.</font>

447
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 times my normal fee.</font>

448
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Done.</font>

449
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, really?
I should have asked for 5.</font>

450
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is 4 still on the table?</font>

451
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There's 5 of us
on the big board now.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Art3mis was next, no surprise there.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She was on the track when I won.
She saw me going backwards.</i></font>

454
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:46,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I gave Aech a tip, made him promise not
to say anything, and then he won next.</i></font>

455
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm pretty sure
he bragged to our pal Daito,</i></font>

456
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>'cause he won right after.</i></font>

457
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And of course,
Daito told his best friend, Sho...</i></font>

458
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He totally totaled his car,</i></font>

Let me get an autograph!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch it!</font>

473
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:50,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're famous now!
You can't just go wherever you want!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh!</font>

477
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:14,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is... That is not funny.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh.</font>

494
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that Sorrento?</font>

495
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorrento started as an intern.</font>

496
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He claims he learned
at the feet of the master.</font>

497
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how he convinced IOI
to create the Sixers for him,</font>

498
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">his Halliday knowledge.</font>

499
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But ask Ogden Morrow?</font>

500
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says the only thing Sorrento
actually knew about Halliday</font>

501
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was how he liked his coffee.</font>

502
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could have, like,
different tiers of accounts,</font>

503
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like a gold member.</font>

504
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:38,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A person could be
silver, platinum, bronze.</font>

505
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:40,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, depending on what they pay.</font>

506
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Highest one maybe being "Water"
because "OASIS," right?</font>

00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell of a latte.</font>

508
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you fast-forward to the stuff
about Halliday's date?</font>

509
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Halliday actually went on a date?</font>

510
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what happened?</font>

511
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing. I invited her over.</font>

512
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, did you at least get her name?</font>

513
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Kira, I told you,
like the character in <i>The Dark Crystal.</i></font>

514
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's her gamer tag.</font>

515
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Karen.
- Karen.</font>

516
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, okay? Karen Underwood.</font>

517
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:16,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. Karen Underwood,
as in Ogden Morrow's wife?</font>

518
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just watch.</font>

519
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, listen, you and Karen Underwood.
What'd you do?</font>

520
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She wanted to go dancing,</font>

521
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so we watched a movie.</font>

522
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And?</font>

523
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the juice?</font>

524
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me some juice!</font>

525
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There is no juice!
- Oh, God!</font>

526
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold the phone.</font>

527
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Halliday went on a date
with Ogden Morrow's wife?</font>

528
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just once, years before
they were even married, but yeah.</font>

529
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And despite that,
and the fact that she died,</font>

530
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the name "Kira" is only mentioned once
in all of Halliday's Journals.</font>

531
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not possible.</font>

532
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is. Look it up.</font>

533
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What we just saw is the only time
she's ever mentioned.</font>

534
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It makes no sense.</font>

535
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was an important part
of both their lives.</font>

536
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll bet you anything. All my coin.</font>

537
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Search "Karen Underwood Morrow."</font>

538
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Kira, I told you,
like the character in</i> The Dark Crystal.</font>

539
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That's her gamer tag.</i></font>

540
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Halliday purposely removed every
mention of her except for this one.</font>

541
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's weird. Why?</font>

542
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like,
it was just so painful for him</font>

543
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to have to see her face
or hear her name.</font>

544
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he loved her.</font>

545
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He couldn't tell that to Morrow.</font>

546
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's sad.
He should have told her how he felt.</font>

547
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, he missed his chance.</font>

548
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>

549
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found the clue to
the race in the other scene, but...</font>

550
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've always felt
that the biggest clue</font>

551
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the contest was hidden here.</font>

552
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.</font>

553
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lose.</font>

554
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't sweat it, Curator.</font>

555
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, Kira is the Rosebud
at the center of his story.</font>

556
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's the big mystery.</font>

557
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. A bet is a bet.</font>

558
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wow. A quarter. You can keep it.</font>

559
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You can keep it.</font>

560
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You free Thursday?
- Who, me?</font>

561
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, him.</font>

562
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Yes, you!</font>

563
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know The Distracted Globe?</font>

564
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, the dance club.</font>

565
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:22,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meet me there. 10:00 p.m.</font>

566
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something I wanna show you.</font>

567
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, bye-bye!</font>

568
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did she just ask me out?</font>

569
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I was starting to like her.</font>

570
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

571
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't do that.</font>

572
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Z, I can't believe
you told her about Kira.</font>

573
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? I told you.</font>

574
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what about this?</font>

575
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Have you considered
that Art3mis could be using you?</font>

576
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:54,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, dude, she's giving me a clue.
Maybe I'm the one using her.</font>

577
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:58,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should I go more <i>Thriller?</i></font>

578
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Punk?</font>

580
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

583
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does it look like I'm trying too hard?</font>

584
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Listen to yourself!</font>

585
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a massive cyber crush
on this girl.</font>

586
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's hacking your heart
to get to your head.</font>

587
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it!</font>

588
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Buckaroo Banzai?</i>
- Yeah!</font>

589
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:28,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? You're gonna wear the outfit
from your favorite movie?</font>

590
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be that guy.</font>

591
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am that guy.</font>

592
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Z, you gotta be more careful about
who you meet in the OASIS.</font>

593
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aech, Art3mis gets me.
She'll get my outfit.</font>

594
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:39,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's just this connection.
I mean, sometimes, we even...</font>

- Yeah!</font>

596
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have that. Me and you.</font>

597
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know, but that's because
we're best friends, dude.</font>

598
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She could be a dude, too, dude.</font>

599
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:50,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

600
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm serious!</font>

601
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She could actually be a 300-pound dude</font>

602
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who lives in his mama's basement
in suburban Detroit.</font>

603
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And her name is Chuck.</font>

604
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think about that.</font>

605
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, dude, is that Parzival?</font>

606
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,002

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here, man. Hey, can we get a photo?</font>

608
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you so much!

610
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,189

614
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah! You look...
- Oh.</font>

615
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look awesome!</font>

616
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- Wow.</font>

617
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,052

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What a freak!

622
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's cool, right? I mean...</font>

623
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So, what's the plan?</i></font>

624
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Are you gonna kill their avatars?
Zero them out?</i></font>

625
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're both here
at The Distracted Globe.</font>

626
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't talk.</font>

627
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The Distracted Globe
was one of the first clubs</i></font>

628
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Halliday created in the OASIS.</i></font>

629
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That's common knowledge.</i></font>

630
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I double-checked</font>

631
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:03,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it turns out he started building it
right after that moment you showed me.</font>

632
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The date with Kira.</font>

633
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, and she was a serious dancer.</font>

634
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe he thought he'd take her here,</font>

635
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like on a virtual date.</font>

636
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As if that ever works.</font>

637
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:14,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Halliday built it for her?</font>

638
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they never made it
past the first date.</font>

639
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Halliday's the creator...</font>

640
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:18,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who hates his own creation.</font>

641
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the club is the thing he hates.</font>

642
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And "A hidden key, a leap not taken"?</font>

643
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But people jump off it all night long.</font>

644
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But none of those people
had the Copper Key,</font>

645
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>so when we jump off,
maybe it's different. Right?</i></font>

646
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:34,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Right.</i></font>

647
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we take it together?</font>

648
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

649
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not clanning up or anything.</font>

650
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course not. I don't clan.</font>

651
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait...</font>

652
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

653
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow! Whoa.</font>

654
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:01,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think this is it.
No scoreboard, no obstacles.</font>

655
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Maybe a dance challenge?
- Whoa!</font>

656
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Old-school!</font>

657
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You come prepared?</font>

658
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:47,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Prepared"?</font>

659
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of haptics you rockin'?</font>

660
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got the gloves
and full visor, or a full body?</font>

661
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:02,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you feel this?</font>

662
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, yeah.</font>

663
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got the X1 haptic bootsuit
with the microfiber crotch inlay.</font>

664
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My, Parzival, you did come prepared.</font>

665
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I've been thinking.</font>

666
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it'd be cool if
we met up in the real world.</font>

667
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you'd be disappointed.</font>

668
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I wouldn't. I like you.</font>

669
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't even know me.</font>

670
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't what I really look like.</font>

671
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:46,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't my real body,
or my real face.</font>

672
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care.</font>

673
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna know your real name.</font>

674
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My name's Wade.
- What?</font>

675
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I said my name's...
- Stop!</font>

676
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Buckaroo blows it. Shocking.</font>

677
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you crazy?
You don't tell anyone who you are.</font>

678
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:15,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't use your real name.</font>

679
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not just anyone.</font>

680
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:17,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know me.</font>

681
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:19,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know anything about me.
We've never met.</font>

682
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do know you, Arty.</font>

683
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:24,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in love with you.</font>

684
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is this part of the challenge?
- No.</font>

685
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an ambush.</font>

686
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">IOI, always in the way.</font>

687
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:48,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you hear what I said?
I said I'm in love with you.</font>

688
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:50,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you're not.</font>

689
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You only know what I want you to know.</font>

690
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:55,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You only see what I want you to see.</font>

691
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what you're in love with.</font>

692
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out!</font>

693
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull.</font>

694
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Head back! Z! Your armor is running low.</font>

695
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:43,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just bought this.</font>

696
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zemeckis Cube.</font>

697
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:55,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turns everything
back in time 60 seconds.</font>

698
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you waited until now to use it?</font>

699
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:12,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, you were amazing.</font>

700
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't a game, Z.</font>

701
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm doing this to stop IOI.</font>

702
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm talking
about real-world consequences.</font>

703
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People suffering.</font>

704
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:26,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Actual life-and-death stuff.
- I know. I know...</font>

705
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:30,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you don't know!
My dad died in a loyalty center.</font>

706
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He borrowed gear.
- He built up debt.</font>

707
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He moved in with the promise of
working it off, but he never did.</font>

708
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">IOI just raised his living expenses,</font>

709
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then he got sick,
and he couldn't afford to get out.</font>

710
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then he died!</font>

711
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:45,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry, I didn't...</font>

712
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you don't live in the real world, Z.</font>

713
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From what you've told me,
I don't think you ever have.</font>

714
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You live inside this... This illusion,</font>

715
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I can't afford
to let you distract me.</font>

716
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How the hell did they get away?</font>

717
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Do you want the long version?
Your guys suck.</i></font>

718
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They failed to kill his avatar,</i></font>

721
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:24,683

because I rock, actually worked.</i></font>

722
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's still on the board.</font>

723
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,979

731
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you loyal, Ms. Zandor?</font>

732
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:56,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really want me to answer that?</font>

733
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, when you're at war,</font>

734
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you need people
who are loyal to a fault.</font>

735
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People you can count on
to get things done.</font>

736
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:05,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just get people arrested
for not paying their bills.</font>

737
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, 'cause there are some problems
that require a physical solution,</font>

738
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but there are other times,
particularly at war,</font>

739
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you need a different set of rules.</font>

740
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The rules of war.
- Exactly.</font>

741
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too bad my division doesn't operate
inside the OASIS.</font>

742
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but if this war
remains in the OASIS,</font>

743
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then you can't do anything.</font>

744
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:25,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, this is one of those conversations
that we're not really having.</font>

745
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we've had
these kind of conversations before,</font>

746
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:28,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and look where you are now.</font>

747
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:31,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a seat on the board,
head of your own division,</font>

748
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:35,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a division that will cease to exist
if the wrong person wins this contest.</font>

749
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:38,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">F'Nale, a game decides our fate.</font>

750
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:42,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only question is,
how far are we willing to go to win it?</font>

751
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me what you need, Nolan.</font>

752
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

753
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where am I?</font>

754
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">IOI Plaza.
You're a hologram in the real world.</font>

755
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a really cool rig.</font>

756
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:20,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.
It's a brand-new Habashaw, OIR 9400.</font>

757
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like a giant hamster ball.</font>

758
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:27,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, if you came to work at IOI,
you'd get one of these.</font>

759
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't clan up.</font>

760
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:31,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd also get your own
penthouse apartment in Columbus</font>

761
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the highest-speed connection.</font>

762
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:39,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the OASIS, you'd get unlimited
weapons, magic items, ships.</font>

763
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want the ship from <i>Defender?</i></font>

764
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, the kind
that can just jump into hyperspace?</font>

765
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i></font>

766
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have that?</font>

767
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything you need
to help you find that egg,</font>

768
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then there's the salary.</font>

769
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 million a year.</font>

770
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:59,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you do happen to find
that Easter egg, there's a bonus.</font>

771
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">25 million dollars.</font>

772
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:10,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see you're using
emotion-suppressing software right now,</font>

773
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:13,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and why wouldn't you?
It's smart, not to show your hand.</font>

774
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a lot of money.
I could really use it.</font>

775
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't think you and I
would have the same plans.</font>

776
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:33,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't know about that.
What, for the OASIS?</font>

777
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:36,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess
if you're not a John Hughes fan...</font>

778
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I am.</font>

779
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because the first thing that I would do</font>

780
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is convert all the schools
on Ludus to replicas</font>

781
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from <i>The Breakfast Club</i>
and <i>Ferris Bueller.</i></font>

782
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way. That's a great idea.</font>

783
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which school, Ridgemont or Faber?</font>

784
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High,</i>
not John Hughes.</font>

785
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:00,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a trap.
Faber College from <i>Animal House.</i></font>

786
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,042

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Ferris Bueller</i> and <i>The Breakfast Club,</i>
they went to Shermer High School,</font>

789
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is in Shermer, Illinois.
I know what you think.</font>

790
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I'm a corporate asshole,</font>

791
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I don't appreciate
pop culture, but...</font>

792
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:20,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, that's not true.
You know, when I wanna blow off steam...</font>

793
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:24,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink Tab, play <i>Robotron,</i>
listen to Duran Duran.</font>

794
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:25,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I crack open a Tab.</font>

795
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I put on some Duran Duran.
I play <i>Robotron.</i></font>

796
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I love the OASIS.</font>

797
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause it's just full
of all these things, man,</font>

798
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that people love. You know?</font>

799
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a businessman. I get it.</font>

800
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I gotta do my job.</font>

801
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:53,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I didn't ask you here
just to help us find the egg, Parzival.</font>

802
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:58,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I asked you here for what comes after.</font>

803
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would Halliday say?</font>

804
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">James Halliday is dead.</font>

805
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. He is.</font>

806
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:13,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All that's left of him is this contest.
And you know what?</font>

807
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:17,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It just seems like
he wouldn't want you winning it.</font>

808
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A fanboy knows a hater,</font>

809
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:21,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I know you've got a whole department
of oologists in your ear.</font>

810
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if you wanna know
what I really think...</font>

811
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you're full of shit.</font>

812
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's my offer.</font>

813
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:33,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your board of directors,
you got them in the other ear?</font>

814
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you tell 'em this.</font>

815
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:39,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If they dump you, I'll consider it.</font>

816
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I might say something off the record.</font>

817
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to make the offer.</font>

818
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:47,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The board expected it,
but I was really hoping you'd say no.</font>

819
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because if anyone's gonna win
this competition, it's me.</font>

820
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My avatar gets the egg</font>

821
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:56,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause I'm the only one here
with the balls to run this place.</font>

822
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, you really switched gears there.</font>

823
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From fairly reasonable
to maniacal overlord.</font>

824
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should be grateful, Wade.</font>

825
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You won't be around
to endure my maniacal reign.</i></font>

826
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's right. I know who you are.</font>

827
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:14,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wade Owen Watts, born August 12, 2027.</font>

Unit 56K, Columbus stacks.</font>

829
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:22,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were last seen entering your trailer
3 days ago.</font>

830
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:23,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You haven't left since.</font>

831
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:24,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing? You can't...</font>

832
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With all that's going on in the world,</font>

833
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do you really think that
anyone's gonna give a damn</font>

834
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about an explosion</font>

835
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in some ghetto trash rat warren
in Columbus?</font>

836
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorrento, don't do this.
I'm not even there!</font>

837
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not for long.</font>

838
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call Alice.</font>

839
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dial Alice.</font>

840
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pick up! Pick up! Alice!</font>

841
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This bootsuit's pretty awesome.
Thanks for that.</font>

842
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rick! Rick, the place is gonna blow!</font>

843
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rick, is that Wade?</font>

844
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Put Alice on!
- Let me talk to him.</font>

845
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't call here anymore, you got me?</font>

846
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:31,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't wanna hear your voice
ever again.</font>

847
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:12,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Contact Aech, Daito, Sho, and Art3mis.</font>

848
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">IOI came for me in the real world.</font>

849
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:18,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They gotta be coming after you,
so wherever you are...</font>

850
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry about the blindfold.</font>

851
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My guys are a little paranoid.</font>

852
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say that again.</font>

853
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My guys are a little paranoid.</font>

854
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Art3mis?</font>

855
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:02,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My real name is Samantha,
but yeah, I'm Art3mis.</font>

856
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Showers are that way,
clean clothes, too.</font>

857
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to the rebellion, Wade.</font>

858
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:29,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's IOI.
So the stacks are over there?</font>

859
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been living this close
to each other the whole time?</font>

860
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next door,</font>

861
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:41,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">around the world,
it's all the same in the OASIS.</font>

862
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the record,</font>

863
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">um...</font>

864
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not disappointed.</font>

865
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said I would be disappointed
when I met you, but...</font>

866
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not.</font>

867
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:00,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've lived with it my whole life.
You don't have to pretend.</font>

868
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a birthmark, so what?</font>

869
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would that scare me?</font>

870
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Z, if I hurt you, I'm sorry.</font>

871
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:31,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's...</font>

872
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, did you just call me "Z"?</font>

873
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God. Did I?
- I think you did.</font>

874
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wade, I'm sorry.</font>

875
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:42,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Wade, Z.</font>

876
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:45,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can call me whatever you want.
And I'll call you Sam.</font>

877
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:46,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

878
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:48,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Samantha?</font>

879
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Cool.</font>

880
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

881
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so much slower here.</font>

882
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:08,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, the wind, the people...</font>

883
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything.</font>

884
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We forget what it's like to be outside.</font>

885
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

886
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh...
- Oh, shit!</font>

887
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:28,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I just figured it out.
- Figured what out?</font>

888
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:30,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The second clue. I know what it means.</font>

889
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been thinking about it
too literally.</font>

890
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The leap not taken,"</font>

891
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:42,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the leap Halliday didn't take,
is with Kira.</font>

892
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:46,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but... I mean, he blamed her
for breaking up him and Morrow.</font>

893
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:49,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Halliday was madly in love with her.</font>

894
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had a chance with Kira.
He had a chance to kiss her, but...</font>

895
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:52,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't take the leap.</font>

896
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:55,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. So that's where we go next.</font>

897
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The place where the leap wasn't taken.</font>

898
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the date was.</font>

899
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At the movies!</font>

900
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Curator.</font>

901
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We figured out the second clue.
The challenge is here.</font>

902
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Halliday kept track of every movie
he ever watched,</font>

903
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the week and the year he watched it,
and how many times.</font>

904
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:15,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Curator, can we see
November 23 to 27, 2025?</font>

905
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:17,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the week
he went on the date with Kira.</font>

906
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:25,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so our options for that week
are <i>The Fly</i> remake.</font>

907
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great flick, terrible date movie.</font>

908
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Say Anything...</i> That would make sense.</font>

909
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:36,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta remember the clue.
"A creator who hates his own creation."</font>

910
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The Shining!</i></font>

911
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:44,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Halliday's
11th favorite horror film,</font>

912
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:47,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's based on the best-selling book
by Stephen King,</font>

913
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:48,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who hated the movie!</font>

914
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! No side chitchat.</font>

915
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we found it.</font>

916
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you absolutely sure
you want to go here?</font>

917
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely positive.</font>

918
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:03,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's hope you have the belly for it.</font>

919
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>

920
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ticking clock.</font>

921
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:54,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so I'm estimating about</font>

922
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 minutes to find the key.</font>

923
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:58,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, there are so many keys
in <i>The Shining,</i> though.</font>

924
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:00,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do we start?</font>

925
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:04,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen <i>The Shining.</i>
Is it really scary?</font>

926
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:08,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, I had to watch it
through my fingers.</font>

927
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so we got the key
from room 237,</font>

928
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the keys to the Snowcat,</font>

929
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or the keys they give Jack
at the beginning of the movie.</font>

930
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well,
if it's "the leap not taken,"</font>

931
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:18,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe the key isn't a key at all.</font>

932
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:19,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know where the Snowcat keys are!</font>

933
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say we split up.</font>

934
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We get all the keys</font>

935
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:24,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then we meet back
at the Torrances' apartment.</font>

936
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:29,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Danny.</font>

937
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come play with us.</font>

938
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:36,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little girls,
y'all know how to get out of here?</font>

939
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait!</font>

940
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:44,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, where's Aech?</font>

941
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:45,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait!</font>

942
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:47,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aech!</font>

943
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:49,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no!</font>

944
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:09,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh!</font>

945
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh!</font>

946
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:52,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, uh, hi, naked lady. I'm sorry.</font>

947
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't mean to interrupt,
uh, your bath time.</font>

948
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know self-care can be important.</font>

949
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, but can you do me a favor
and tell me, where are all the exits?</font>

950
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:04,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh. Whoa.</font>

951
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:07,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, am I being punked?</font>

952
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause you're likin' me
a little way too much.</font>

953
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:13,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, you know what?
I'ma go with it.</font>

954
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:27,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh!</font>

955
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:06,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time's running out.</font>

956
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, Z, is Art3mis pissed at me?</font>

957
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:10,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, I'm pissed at you.
You've never seen <i>The Shining,</i> have you?</font>

958
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I hate scary movies!</font>

959
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got the key.</font>

960
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:14,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweet! To room 237!</font>

961
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We ain't got no business
goin' to room 237!</font>

962
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:18,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should stay out!</font>

963
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus, there was this crazy,
naked zombie lady in there.</font>

964
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are no zombies in <i>The Shining.</i></font>

965
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:24,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe it's not supposed
to be like the movie.</font>

966
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kira is the key.
You're the one who said it.</font>

967
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:28,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, y'all. I saw a picture of Kira!</font>

968
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

969
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where?</font>

970
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:44,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Kira. "Escape your past."</font>

971
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The leap not taken."</font>

972
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Halliday's greatest fear
wasn't <i>The Shining</i></font>

973
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:51,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or any book or movie.</font>

974
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His biggest fear was kissing a girl.</font>

975
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the leap he couldn't take.</font>

976
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ballroom.</font>

977
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aech, come on.</font>

978
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:31,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zombies. Told you.</font>

979
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:33,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's her.</font>

980
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Kira.</font>

981
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:40,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of this is in <i>The Shining.</i></font>

982
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:43,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Z, look. That's the zombie-circle level
in <i>Mayhem Mansion,</i></font>

983
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one of Halliday's first games.</font>

984
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:47,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole <i>Shining</i> trivia
is just a diversion.</font>

985
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1 minute left.</font>

986
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:52,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do we get to her?</font>

987
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:53,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take the leap.</font>

988
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:54,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait!</font>

989
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:57,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

990
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Mr. Dead Guy. Cool if I lead?</font>

991
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Care to dance?</font>

992
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:59,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know how long
I've been waiting for you to ask?</font>

993
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, well, well.</font>

994
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:12,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you found my Jade Key.</font>

995
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine that.</font>

996
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:23,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

997
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Kira was a very beautiful...
- Go on.</font>

998
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of our oologists saw them
enter the media library.</font>

999
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She cracked the clue.</font>

1000
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, we just have to win
<i>The Shining</i> challenge.</font>

1001
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:12,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get her off me! Get her off me!</font>

1002
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:26,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Sorrento,
I really think you need to see this.</font>

1003
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:30,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now Parzival's got the Jade Key.</font>

1004
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's alive.</font>

1005
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. I'll get back to you.</font>

1006
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got what you're looking for.</font>

1007
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:56,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freeze. This guy.
The one with the lame tattoo.</font>

1008
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:58,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enlarge.</font>

every IOI drone in Columbus.</font>

1010
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find him.</font>

1011
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Groceries are here.</font>

1012
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Gluten-O's...</font>

1013
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"If you know
the answer ultimate,</font>

1014
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:37,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"divide it by the number magic,</font>

1015
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:41,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and what you need, want, and desire
will be found in the fortress tragic."</font>

1016
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:43,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Tragic," that's gotta be Halliday
referring to himself.</font>

1017
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

1018
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:46,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because he was lonely.</font>

1019
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had no one to spend his life with
towards the end.</font>

1020
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:49,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's true.</font>

1021
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The contest has gotta be somehow
about connecting with someone.</font>

1022
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:54,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone.</font>

1023
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wants the person
who cares for the OASIS</font>

1024
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be connected with the world.</font>

1025
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I think
he's trying to tell us.</font>

1026
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wade.</font>

1027
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,482

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? You really think I'm gonna win?</font>

01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:03,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"She might be a 300-pound dude
named Chuck..."</font>

1055
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:07,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Who lives in his mama's basement
in suburban Detroit."</font>

1056
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aech!</font>

1057
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:14,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Helen. My dad called me Aech
It kinda stuck. Let's go!</font>

1058
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:26,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That thing's IDing my van.</font>

1059
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:43,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. They've spotted us.</font>

1060
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:45,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daito.</font>

1061
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:48,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My real name is Toshiro.
Samantha got us a message.</font>

1062
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She told us to meet you here.</font>

1063
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Samantha, they took her to the...</font>

1064
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:53,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The loyalty center, I know.</font>

1065
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:57,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, in other awesome news,
the Sixers found the third challenge.</font>

1066
01:16:57,822 --> 01:16:59,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Just come on, get in!</font>

1067
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:00,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Let's go.</font>

1068
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry up. Go, go, go. All right.</font>

1069
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:17,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did IOI find
the third challenge so fast?</font>

1070
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:19,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">IOI cracked
the first three lines of the clue,</font>

1071
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:20,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so they knew it was sector 14</font>

1072
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:22,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but they couldn't figure out
"the fortress tragic."</font>

1073
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So they sent every guide
they had into that sector</font>

1074
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:27,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until they found the right fortress.</font>

1075
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sho?</font>

1076
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:31,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm 11, so what?</font>

1077
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His real name is Xo.</font>

1078
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:36,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But everyone else calls me Sho,
no big deal.</font>

1079
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:39,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. It is a big deal.</font>

1080
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:42,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sho, you're the world's most badass
11-year-old ever.</font>

1081
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knows.</font>

1082
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:46,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up! Let him tell me.</font>

1083
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:47,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aech!</font>

1084
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to go save Samantha.</font>

1085
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:54,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we can't just
go through the doors of IOI.</font>

1086
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I've been thinkin' about it.
I got a better plan.</font>

1087
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:59,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw Sorrento's rig, right?</font>

1088
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:00,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1089
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:03,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go after the man himself and
make him give Art3mis back to us.</font>

1090
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:05,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But first, I have to know exactly,</font>

1091
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how much about Sorrento's rig
do you remember?</font>

1092
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:11,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kind of everything.</font>

1093
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:28,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Maintenance,
report to loyalty pod 31-B.</i></font>

1094
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:37,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Security, please report
to section 97 for escort.</i></font>

1095
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,188

1096
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to work.</font>

1097
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:13,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Work violation.
Work violation.</i></font>

1098
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:18,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lay those charges every 6 feet.</font>

1099
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:25,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep it moving!</font>

1100
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:28,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you!</font>

1101
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are explosives!</font>

1102
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:37,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">IOI will not reimburse any lost coin
if you zero out.</font>

1103
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep it moving!</font>

1104
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:46,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what is this challenge,
some sort of video game thing?</font>

1105
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An Atari 2600, sir.</font>

1106
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:52,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And every game ever made for it,
thousands of possibilities.</font>

1107
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:54,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come up!</font>

1108
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Halliday,</font>

1109
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:01,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is how you plan to resolve</font>

1110
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the fate of the world's
most important economic resource?</font>

1111
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:07,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Call me when you're close.
- Yes, sir.</font>

1112
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go! No! Ahh!</font>

1113
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1 minute into <i>Centipede,</i>
the ice broke.</font>

1114
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It has to be <i>Joust!</i></font>

1115
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:19,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Halliday still holds the world record
on the 2600 port of that game.</font>

1116
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we just need
to beat his high score.</font>

1117
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:24,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Pitfall!</i> One of the only 2600 games
that still hasn't ended.</font>

1118
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:25,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how about
those <i>Swordquest</i> games?</font>

1119
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! The <i>Swordquest</i> games.</font>

1120
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:29,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were created
for a contest Atari held with real...</font>

1121
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">i-R0k, how are we doin'?</font>

1122
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:42,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be honest, I think I need
physical therapy because it's not...</font>

1123
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is the Orb ready?</font>

1124
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, as you wish.</font>

1125
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:52,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Orb...</font>

1126
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:53,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of Osuvox.</font>

1127
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:55,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah...</font>

1128
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:57,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How does it work?</font>

1129
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:01,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has it got, like, a remote
or is there a button or something?</font>

1130
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nolan, it's a level-99 magic artifact,</font>

1131
01:21:05,152 --> 01:21:08,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not one of your drones,
so it is activated by a magic spell.</font>

1132
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you care to do the honors?</font>

1133
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is she?</font>

1134
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:05,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you get in here?</font>

1135
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:06,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Art3mis.
- Who?</font>

1136
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Samantha Cook. Where is she?</font>

1137
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:14,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you wanna talk, we can talk,
but you gotta put that gun down.</font>

1138
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:17,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You killed my mom's sister.</font>

1139
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:19,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I won't kill you?</font>

1140
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:24,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just slow down, okay?</font>

1141
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:27,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was a corporate decision.
It was not personal.</font>

1142
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:28,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is she?</font>

1143
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:31,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's downstairs in the loyalty center!</font>

1144
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know
she's in the goddamn loyalty center.</font>

1145
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna tell me
exactly which rig she's in</font>

1146
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:39,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the access code to contact her.</font>

1147
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:42,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that seems appropriate.</font>

1148
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start with access code.</font>

1149
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:50,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6, 45, 7, 25.</font>

1150
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:52,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the rig?</font>

1151
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:04,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think he pissed himself.</font>

1152
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:07,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good job, Z. We're in his account.</font>

1153
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:09,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he really doesn't know
he's in the OASIS?</font>

1154
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:14,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what Sorrento should be seeing,</font>

1155
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:17,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but this... This is what we're
making him see.</font>

1156
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:21,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We grabbed him in transit just
as he was logging out of the OASIS,</font>

1157
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:24,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so he thinks he's back in his office
in the real world.</font>

1158
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:28,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But actually, he's here,
in the identical office that Aech built.</font>

1159
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:30,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you basically
just remotely hacked his rig.</font>

1160
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:33,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A fixed rig like Sorrento's
is easy to locate, hard to hack.</font>

1161
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless he's stupid enough
to leave his password lying around.</font>

1162
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loyalty center, I'm in.</font>

1163
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:39,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's get to work.</font>

1164
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Arty.</i>
- Z? Z? Z?</font>

1165
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arty, don't say anything.</font>

1166
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:53,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm tapped directly
into your audio feed.</font>

1167
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:56,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>How did you find me?</i></font>

1168
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:58,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got his password,
hacked Sorrento's rig.</font>

1169
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:01,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Z, I have something to tell you.</font>

1170
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Not now. I have something to show you
that'll get you out of there.</i></font>

1171
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:07,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Sixers found the third challenge.
It's on Planet Doom.</font>

1172
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:09,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's more,
they just put a force field</font>

1173
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:11,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">around Anorak's Castle.</font>

1174
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:18,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard one of the guards calling it
"the Orb of Osuvox,"</font>

1175
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the only way to take it down
is from the inside.</font>

1176
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:23,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's right. Level-99 artifact,</font>

1177
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">creates a magic-resistant,
impenetrable barrier.</font>

1178
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way through it.</font>

1179
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, listen.
That's not important right now.</font>

1180
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's important is
that we get you out of the rig.</font>

1181
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:36,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All right, so I'm looking at a diagram
of your rig.</i></font>

1182

<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Sixers are in the final challenge.
It's an Atari 2600.</font>

01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:20,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you in the Sixer war room?</font>

1314
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:22,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. You gotta get out of there.</font>

1315
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:24,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're playing <i>Adventure.</i></font>

getting into this fight?</font>

1323
01:38:18,309 --> 01:38:19,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm out. Inventory's empty.</font>

1330
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:47,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow!</font>

1331
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:49,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get rid of it! Get rid of it!</font>

1332
01:38:50,716 --> 01:38:52,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fucking Chucky!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to the bridge.
Go now, he's distracted.</font>

Win the third key before they do!</font>

1342
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:47,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's only got 30 seconds
before changing back!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, it's her.</font>

1347
01:43:20,903 --> 01:43:23,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arty! Arty!</font>

1348
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:26,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Z! Got to get to the castle!</font>

1349
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:35,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She never left. She's still here.</font>

1350
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:39,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The girl's in the war room.</font>

1352
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:36,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sho! Hang on!</font>

1353
01:44:55,664 --> 01:44:57,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1354
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:21,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arty, we've got this.
You need to log out.</font>

1355
01:45:21,649 --> 01:45:24,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the game is <i>Adventure,</i>
why haven't they won yet?</font>

1356
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:26,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. Arty, Arty.</font>

1357
01:45:26,278 --> 01:45:28,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm serious, Sorrento's crazy.
He'll kill you.</font>

1358
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:31,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What are you looking at?</i></font>

1359
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:34,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing over there.</font>

1360
01:45:35,204 --> 01:45:36,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're in trouble, aren't you?</font>

1361
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:43,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Samantha, you know I love you.</font>

1362
01:45:43,212 --> 01:45:44,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not the time, Z.</font>

1363
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:45,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can handle the challenge,</font>

1364
01:45:46,048 --> 01:45:47,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I can't let you get hurt
in the real world.</font>

1365
01:45:49,134 --> 01:45:52,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of IOI,
and meet us at River South.</font>

1366
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:00,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wade, no.</font>

1367
01:46:00,396 --> 01:46:02,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll forgive me for this, I promise.</font>

1368
01:46:02,273 --> 01:46:03,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wade, no, no, no.</font>

1369
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:16,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get it together, Sixer. Back to respawn.</font>

1370
01:46:16,996 --> 01:46:18,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, move.</font>

1371
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:19,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're in.</font>

1372
01:46:37,808 --> 01:46:40,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy hand grenade!
How much did that cost?</font>

1373
01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:42,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Less than it's gonna cost them.</font>

1374
01:46:44,023 --> 01:46:45,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

1375
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:58,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, the gunters are approaching
the challenge.</font>

1376
01:46:58,621 --> 01:47:00,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- i-R0k?
- In position, sir.</font>

1377
01:47:00,623 --> 01:47:01,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prepare my rig.</font>

1378
01:47:01,916 --> 01:47:04,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ice is holding. Still going.</font>

1379
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:16,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

1380
01:47:16,221 --> 01:47:17,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's trying to win.</font>

1381
01:47:20,726 --> 01:47:23,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! I won.</font>

1382
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:28,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He lost.</font>

1383
01:47:28,734 --> 01:47:30,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not <i>Adventure.</i></font>

1384
01:47:34,865 --> 01:47:39,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone who wins loses.</font>

1385
01:47:39,328 --> 01:47:42,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not about winning.
It's about playing.</font>

1386
01:47:43,749 --> 01:47:45,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember Halliday's announcement.</font>

1387
01:47:46,251 --> 01:47:48,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The keys are invisible,
and they're hidden in a dark room</font>

1388
01:47:48,671 --> 01:47:50,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's at the center of a maze.</font>

1389
01:47:51,256 --> 01:47:54,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there's a secret in <i>Adventure,</i>
and you don't find it by winning.</font>

1390
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:57,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You find it
by wandering around in a dark room.</font>

1391
01:47:57,846 --> 01:47:59,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until you get to the invisible dot.</font>

1392
01:47:59,556 --> 01:48:01,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's pretty easy
if you know what you're doing.</font>

1393
01:48:01,266 --> 01:48:02,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

1394
01:48:03,435 --> 01:48:05,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me finish it for you.</font>

1395
01:48:09,775 --> 01:48:11,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your last chance, Wade.</font>

1396
01:48:11,694 --> 01:48:14,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last chance. Give me the key.</font>

1397
01:48:14,613 --> 01:48:18,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I give you 50 million
in your account right now.</font>

1398
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why the hell would I ever do that?</font>

1399
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:24,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude! That's the Cataclyst.</font>

1400
01:48:25,165 --> 01:48:26,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, personally, I don't care.</font>

1401
01:48:27,042 --> 01:48:28,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd just as soon
never set foot in the OASIS again,</font>

1402
01:48:28,794 --> 01:48:30,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let alone have to deal
with any of this absurdity.</font>

1403
01:48:30,963 --> 01:48:34,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I know how important
Halliday's competition is to you, so...</font>

1404
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:40,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will never let the future of the OASIS
rest in your hands, Nolan Sorrento.</font>

1405
01:48:40,597 --> 01:48:44,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's fine.
3 easy steps. One.</font>

1406
01:48:44,643 --> 01:48:46,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, I thought you were bluffing.
You know that kills all of us, right?</font>

1407
01:48:47,104 --> 01:48:49,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got 10 years' worth of shit
inside of me.</font>

1408
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:50,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last chance. Two.</font>

1409
01:48:50,858 --> 01:48:52,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not goin' out like that.</font>

1410
01:48:52,234 --> 01:48:53,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a camper move.</font>

1411
01:48:53,485 --> 01:48:54,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't even know
how to activate an orb.</font>

1412
01:49:07,082 --> 01:49:08,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I felt those.</font>

1413
01:49:09,585 --> 01:49:11,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this is my world, Sorrento.</font>

1414
01:49:15,632 --> 01:49:16,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hadouken!</font>

1415
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:38,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, no, no!
- Step 3.</font>

1416
01:49:39,114 --> 01:49:40,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no!</font>

1417
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:40,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me out of this thing.</font>

1418
01:50:54,481 --> 01:50:55,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

1419
01:50:55,899 --> 01:50:57,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys?</font>

1420
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:05,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Z. He's still alive!</font>

1421
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Extra life.</font>

1422
01:51:17,713 --> 01:51:19,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Curator.</font>

1423
01:51:22,009 --> 01:51:23,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on.</font>

1424
01:51:30,893 --> 01:51:32,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Live feed in all OASIS channels.</font>

1425
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Halliday's letting everyone
watch the end of the contest.</font>

1426
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:37,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's so Halliday.</font>

1427
01:51:37,482 --> 01:51:39,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it, we tried <i>Adventure.</i></font>

1428
01:51:39,735 --> 01:51:41,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we tried to win it.</font>

1429
01:51:41,195 --> 01:51:43,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the hidden room isn't
at the end of the game.</font>

1430
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:46,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've gotta go straight
to the invisible dot at the start.</font>

1431
01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:00,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that her?</font>

1432
01:52:01,256 --> 01:52:05,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Red hair, IOI uniform,
doesn't know what planet she's on?</font>

1433
01:52:05,344 --> 01:52:06,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's her.</font>

1434
01:52:18,232 --> 01:52:20,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Toshiro. You know me as Daito.</font>

1435
01:52:23,862 --> 01:52:24,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1436
01:52:27,658 --> 01:52:29,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Arty.</font>

1437
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:35,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know.
Not what you were expecting, huh?</font>

1438
01:52:35,290 --> 01:52:39,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I wasn't expecting
a late '30s-model postal van.</font>

1439
01:52:41,922 --> 01:52:42,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wade?</font>

1440
01:52:43,632 --> 01:52:45,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, I thought the Cataclyst went off.
How are you still playing?</font>

1441
01:52:46,051 --> 01:52:48,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Extra life, long story.
Sorry I shot you.</font>

1442
01:52:50,889 --> 01:52:52,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sho?</font>

1443
01:52:52,516 --> 01:52:54,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Do I have to wear a sign saying,</font>

1444
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:58,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I am 11 years old, shoot me first"?
No, thanks.</font>

1445
01:52:58,188 --> 01:53:00,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dude, give me a hug.
- Ninjas don't hug!</font>

1446
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, everybody,
hold on to somethin'.</font>

1447
01:53:23,839 --> 01:53:25,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got you.</font>

1448
01:53:28,885 --> 01:53:30,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Nolan. Pick up.</font>

1449
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:35,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">F'Nale, tell me something good.</font>

1450
01:53:35,642 --> 01:53:38,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a drone on their tail.
I'm close.</font>

1451
01:53:38,186 --> 01:53:39,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Send me coordinates.</i></font>

1452
01:53:39,396 --> 01:53:41,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you should
leave this to me, Nolan.</font>

1453
01:53:43,483 --> 01:53:46,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nolan? Nolan.</font>

1454
01:53:47,529 --> 01:53:48,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out.</font>

1455
01:53:57,622 --> 01:54:00,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that.</font>

1456
01:54:03,795 --> 01:54:05,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's goin' on out there?</font>

1457
01:54:09,885 --> 01:54:12,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The game is over for them.
What are they watching?</font>

1458
01:54:14,848 --> 01:54:17,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The final key! It's being broadcast.</font>

1459
01:54:19,227 --> 01:54:20,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You see,</i></font>

1460
01:54:20,896 --> 01:54:23,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Warren Robinett was proud of</i> Adventure.</font>

1461
01:54:23,607 --> 01:54:25,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He wanted people to know
who was behind it.</i></font>

1462
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:29,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why he created
the first digital Easter egg</font>

1463
01:54:29,404 --> 01:54:31,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and to find it,
you didn't even have to win.</font>

1464
01:54:32,115 --> 01:54:36,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just had to blindly play,
searching around</font>

1465
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:39,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in rooms for an invisible dot.</font>

1466
01:54:40,415 --> 01:54:42,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You took the dot back to the main screen</font>

1467
01:54:43,001 --> 01:54:47,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that's when you found the first
Easter egg ever put in a video game.</font>

1468
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:48,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The creator's name.</font>

1469
01:55:13,573 --> 01:55:15,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on, man? I can't see shit.</font>

1470
01:55:15,659 --> 01:55:17,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Parzival just got the Crystal Key!</font>

1471
01:55:32,342 --> 01:55:34,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want it or not?</font>

1472
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:39,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aech, what the hell's going on?</font>

1473
01:55:39,474 --> 01:55:41,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just practicing my <i>Mario Kart.</i>
What do you think?</font>

1474
01:55:41,476 --> 01:55:43,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">IOI's trying to kill us, man!</font>

1475
01:55:57,784 --> 01:55:59,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone watching,
if you're in the Columbus stacks,</font>

1476
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:01,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is Parzival.</font>

1477
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:04,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My real-world name is Wade Watts,
and we're gonna need your help.</font>

1478
01:56:04,374 --> 01:56:05,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aech, head for the stacks!</font>

1479
01:56:05,959 --> 01:56:07,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, hold on!</font>

1480
01:56:32,861 --> 01:56:34,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stick the key in, how hard is it?</font>

1481
01:56:40,535 --> 01:56:41,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1482
01:56:49,169 --> 01:56:51,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! Yes!</font>

1483
01:57:07,395 --> 01:57:08,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it?</font>

1484
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:10,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's it.</font>

1485
01:57:10,649 --> 01:57:15,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you just sign these papers,
and the OASIS is yours.</font>

1486
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:19,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will be its sole proprietor.</font>

1487
01:57:20,116 --> 01:57:21,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That ain't so bad, is it?</font>

1488
01:57:43,431 --> 01:57:44,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna need a second.</font>

1489
01:58:13,169 --> 01:58:15,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is wrong.</font>

1490
01:58:15,797 --> 01:58:18,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This pen, this contract.</font>

1491
01:58:21,928 --> 01:58:23,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the moment
that Halliday made Morrow</font>

1492
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:25,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sign over his shares in Gregarious.</font>

1493
01:58:26,266 --> 01:58:28,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was the biggest mistake
of his life.</font>

1494
01:58:28,935 --> 01:58:31,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knew that.</font>

1495
01:58:32,814 --> 01:58:34,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This can't be the end.</font>

1496
01:58:36,067 --> 01:58:37,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a test.</font>

1497
01:58:42,324 --> 01:58:44,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't make the same mistake you did.</font>

1498
01:58:50,707 --> 01:58:52,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, good.</font>

1499
01:58:55,295 --> 01:58:58,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just needed to be sure.</font>

1500
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:14,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is where you grew up.</font>

1501
01:59:24,199 --> 01:59:26,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's just me a long time ago.</font>

1502
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:29,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like to have him around
from time to time.</font>

1503
01:59:30,747 --> 01:59:32,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I have to show you something.</font>

1504
01:59:33,041 --> 01:59:34,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This... Come on.</font>

1505
01:59:34,751 --> 01:59:36,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the button.</font>

1506
01:59:36,586 --> 01:59:39,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you push it,
the whole simulation shuts down</font>

1507
01:59:39,881 --> 01:59:43,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a tapeworm program will erase
all of the backup servers.</font>

1508
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:46,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you now have the power
to turn the OASIS off forever.</font>

1509
01:59:47,263 --> 01:59:48,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you understand?</font>

1510
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:55,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah,</font>

1511
01:59:55,438 --> 01:59:57,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">try not to accidentally erase</font>

1512
01:59:57,399 --> 02:00:00,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the whole of the OASIS
on your first day.</font>

1513
02:00:09,452 --> 02:00:11,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The stacks are straight ahead!</font>

1514
02:00:26,970 --> 02:00:29,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I expect you have to go.
I know I do.</font>

1515
02:00:29,931 --> 02:00:32,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, now is the time for you
to receive your prize</font>

1516
02:00:32,475 --> 02:00:34,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because you won all three keys.</font>

1517
02:00:35,019 --> 02:00:39,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once you take this egg,
the game will be over.</font>

1518
02:00:39,733 --> 02:00:42,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The egg, the egg...</font>

1519
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:52,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know what you did here.</font>

1520
02:00:52,662 --> 02:00:55,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You turn around and
walk out of here while you still can.</font>

1521
02:01:08,595 --> 02:01:10,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I created the OASIS</font>

1522
02:01:11,139 --> 02:01:14,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I never felt at home
in the real world.</font>

1523
02:01:15,894 --> 02:01:19,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just didn't know how to connect
with the people there.</font>

1524
02:01:20,356 --> 02:01:23,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was afraid for all of my life.</font>

1525
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:26,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right up until the day
I knew my life was ending.</font>

1526
02:01:32,243 --> 02:01:36,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, that... That was when
I realized that,</font>

1527
02:01:37,248 --> 02:01:42,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as terrifying and painful
as reality can be,</font>

1528
02:01:43,213 --> 02:01:47,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's also the only place</font>

1529
02:01:48,885 --> 02:01:50,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you can get a decent meal.</font>

1530
02:01:57,185 --> 02:01:58,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because</font>

1531
02:02:00,438 --> 02:02:02,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">reality</font>

1532
02:02:07,195 --> 02:02:08,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is real.</font>

1533
02:02:08,863 --> 02:02:10,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand what I'm saying?</font>

1534
02:02:12,408 --> 02:02:15,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Yes, I do.</font>

1535
02:02:24,838 --> 02:02:26,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He did it.</font>

1536
02:02:27,799 --> 02:02:29,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He got the egg.</font>

1537
02:02:30,093 --> 02:02:31,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hooray.</font>

1538
02:02:32,512 --> 02:02:34,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No!
- No! Please!</font>

1539
02:03:07,714 --> 02:03:08,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold it!</font>

1540
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:14,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop the gun! Now! On the ground!</font>

1541
02:03:14,804 --> 02:03:17,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn around! Hands on your head.</font>

1542
02:03:17,557 --> 02:03:19,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walk back towards me.</font>

1543
02:03:34,824 --> 02:03:39,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Halliday.
Something I don't understand.</font>

1544
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:42,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not an avatar, are you?</font>

1545
02:03:43,416 --> 02:03:45,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1546
02:03:46,586 --> 02:03:48,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is Halliday really dead?</font>

1547
02:03:50,256 --> 02:03:51,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1548
02:03:57,597 --> 02:03:59,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what are you?</font>

1549
02:04:02,602 --> 02:04:04,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye, Parzival.</font>

1550
02:04:06,230 --> 02:04:07,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

1551
02:04:08,858 --> 02:04:11,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for playing my game.</font>

1552
02:04:40,098 --> 02:04:41,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wade?</font>

1553
02:04:42,809 --> 02:04:44,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ogden Morrow?
- Ogden Morrow?</font>

1554
02:04:44,727 --> 02:04:46,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can call me "Og."</font>

1555
02:04:46,521 --> 02:04:49,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, there are some people out here
that would very much like to meet you.</font>

1556
02:04:49,857 --> 02:04:52,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, this is incredible.</font>

1557
02:04:53,111 --> 02:04:55,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an honor to meet you, Og, but I...</font>

1558
02:05:00,076 --> 02:05:01,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something I need to do first.</font>

1559
02:05:05,665 --> 02:05:07,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not like Halliday.</font>

1560
02:05:11,170 --> 02:05:13,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm taking the leap.</font>

1561
02:05:29,689 --> 02:05:30,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're looking for Wade Watts.</font>

1562
02:05:32,817 --> 02:05:34,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need you to make a statement
about the clip you sent in</font>

1563
02:05:35,069 --> 02:05:36,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of Nolan Sorrento's confession.</font>

1564
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, that was me.</font>

1565
02:05:40,033 --> 02:05:42,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? I record everything
in my workshop.</font>

1566
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me out of this.</font>

1567
02:05:57,216 --> 02:05:58,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you guys?</font>

1568
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:03,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The people you need right now, lawyers.
From Gregarious Games.</font>

1569
02:06:06,642 --> 02:06:08,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They want your signature, Wade.</font>

1570
02:06:16,235 --> 02:06:18,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm splitting it with my clan.</font>

1571
02:06:18,488 --> 02:06:20,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna run things together.</font>

1572
02:06:24,827 --> 02:06:26,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a good choice.</font>

1573
02:06:54,816 --> 02:06:57,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">F'Nale, listen to me very carefully.</font>

1574
02:07:07,078 --> 02:07:09,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Morrow... I mean, Og,</font>

1575
02:07:09,997 --> 02:07:11,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how'd you get here so fast?</font>

1576
02:07:11,457 --> 02:07:13,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I flew from the stars
on my magic sleigh.</font>

1577
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:16,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone's been watching.</font>

1578
02:07:16,796 --> 02:07:20,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, I've been watching
a little closer than most.</font>

1579
02:07:24,053 --> 02:07:25,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You?</font>

1580
02:07:25,972 --> 02:07:27,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the Curator?</font>

1581
02:07:30,935 --> 02:07:33,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well played, Parzival.</font>

1582
02:07:34,397 --> 02:07:36,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim told me nothing about the contest,</font>

1583
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:39,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so there was no rule
about me losing a bet to a smart kid.</font>

1584
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:41,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that you needed my help.</font>

1585
02:07:42,446 --> 02:07:46,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You figured out that Kira was the key
on your own.</font>

1586
02:07:46,784 --> 02:07:49,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but... Kira wasn't the key.</font>

1587
02:07:50,746 --> 02:07:52,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was you, Mr. Morrow.</font>

1588
02:07:54,750 --> 02:07:56,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were the Rosebud.</font>

1589
02:07:56,586 --> 02:07:58,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Halliday's biggest regret was</font>

1590
02:08:00,506 --> 02:08:02,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">losing his only friend.</font>

1591
02:08:06,345 --> 02:08:08,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Jim used to say the OASIS</font>

1592
02:08:08,681 --> 02:08:11,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was never supposed to be
a one-player game.</font>

1593
02:08:14,854 --> 02:08:17,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, who do we have here?</font>

1594
02:08:17,648 --> 02:08:20,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Well, look who it is.</font>

1595
02:08:20,318 --> 02:08:21,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my heroes, the High Five.</font>

1596
02:08:22,069 --> 02:08:23,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You must be Art3mis.
- Samantha.</font>

1597
02:08:23,738 --> 02:08:25,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The High Five took over the OASIS,</i></font>

1598
02:08:25,698 --> 02:08:27,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and the first thing we did</i></font>

1599
02:08:27,325 --> 02:08:30,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>was sign Ogden Morrow
to a non-exclusive consultancy.</i></font>

1600
02:08:30,828 --> 02:08:33,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The salary, per his demand,</i></font>

1601
02:08:33,831 --> 02:08:36,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>was 25 cents. One quarter.</i></font>

1602
02:08:40,296 --> 02:08:42,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>With his guidance,
our second move was to ban</i></font>

1603
02:08:42,715 --> 02:08:45,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>any loyalty centers
from accessing the OASIS.</i></font>

1604
02:08:46,177 --> 02:08:49,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>IOI had no choice.
They shut 'em all down.</i></font>

1605
02:08:52,391 --> 02:08:54,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The third thing we did
wasn't as popular.</i></font>

1606
02:08:55,394 --> 02:08:58,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We closed the OASIS
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</i></font>

1607
02:08:59,398 --> 02:09:01,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I know, it sounds like a weird move,</i></font>

1608
02:09:01,901 --> 02:09:04,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but people need to spend
more time in the real world.</i></font>

1609
02:09:06,447 --> 02:09:09,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>'Cause, like Halliday said,</i></font>

1610
02:09:09,533 --> 02:09:13,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>reality is the only thing that's real.</i></font>
