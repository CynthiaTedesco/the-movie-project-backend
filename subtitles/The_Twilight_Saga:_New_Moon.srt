1
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:01,169
"These violent delights
have violent ends,

2
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,715
"and in their triumph die,
like fire and powder,

3
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:10,303
"which, as they kiss, consume."

4
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,756
Gran?

5
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:05,775
Edward, don't! She'll see you.

6
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:12,782
Hmm.

7
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:17,662
Okay.

8
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:30,217
Gran, I'd like you to meet...

9
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:01,581
Happy birthday, Bella.

10
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,012
Happy birthday.

11
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:22,394
I thought we agreed, no presents.

12
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:26,022
Well, the one from me's not wrapped,
so it doesn't count.

13
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:32,529
That's actually great. Thanks, Dad.

14
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:36,783
It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.

15
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:39,119
Well, she coordinated me.

16
00:03:40,997 --> 00:03:44,457
It's to put your pictures in from senior year.

17
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:48,169
Senior year.

18
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,757
-How'd you get so old so fast?
-l didn't. It's not that old.

19
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,635
I don't know. Is that a gray hair?

20
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:57,721
No. No way.

21
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:03,435
Happy birthday.

22
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,936
That's really funny.

23
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,399
Another missing
hiker brings the total to three presumed dead.

24
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,192
Rangers are searching
for the killer animal...

25
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:16,448
Situation's a!! critica!

26
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:20,368
You've got to look first before you go

27
00:04:20,453 --> 00:04:22,370
It's Bella. Bella!

28
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:24,289
-Hi.
- I'm...

29
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,585
Today's the big day, Bella.

30
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,254
A and J essay due.

31
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:34,716
-Oh, yeah.
-Wherefore art thou, Bella?

32
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,842
)

33
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:39,721
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom wants me to put together, like,

34
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:40,930
a scrapbook full of memories.

35
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:42,015
Oh.
Cool. Yeah.

36
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:43,433
I take them. I'm not in them.

37
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:44,893
-No, no, no, come here.
- Well, you are today.

38
00:04:44,977 --> 00:04:46,353
You'll photoshop this
if my nose looks big, right?

39
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:50,231
Don't worry, I知 in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.

40
00:04:50,316 --> 00:04:51,733
That's good.

41
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:54,486
Oh, good. Cullen's here.

42
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,532
Well, talk to you later.

43
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,224
-Happy birthday.
-Don't remind me.

44
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:25,308
Mmm.

45
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:29,562
Bella, your birth is definitely
something to celebrate.

46
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:32,357
-Yeah, but my aging's not.
-Your aging?

47
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:37,487
I think 18 is a little young
to start worrying about that.

48
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,197
Its one year older than you.

49
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:41,825
No, it isn't. I知 109.

50
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:45,245
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating
such an old man.

51
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:48,873
-Mmm.
-It痴 gross. I should be thoroughly repulsed.

52
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:49,958
Uh-huh.

53
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:03,138
-We have to go to class.
-Okay.

54
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:09,436
Wait a second.

55
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:12,105
Someone wants you.

56
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:14,691
- Bella!
-Jacob!

57
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:16,484
What?

58
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:20,321
I'll leave you to talk.

59
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:28,288
Hello, biceps! You know,
anabolic steroids are really bad for you.

60
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:31,749
Well, I知 just filling out, Bella.

61
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:35,253
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic
if we hung out more.

62
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:38,631
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.

63
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:42,177
I知 all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.

64
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,263
They let any old riffraff into this place.

65
00:06:45,347 --> 00:06:47,432
-I see. Then why are you slumming it?
-Mmm-hmm.

66
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:49,976
l was just buying a part for the Rabbit.

67
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,604
You should really come
take a ride when it's done.

68
00:06:52,688 --> 00:06:54,063
Is it fast?

69
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,190
Um.

70
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,066
It痴 decent.

71
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:00,528
-I知 kidding.
-Okay. Good.

72
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:03,364
Hey, happy birthday.

73
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:07,076
Your dad told my dad, so...

74
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:09,704
Yeah, of course he did.

75
00:07:10,247 --> 00:07:12,832
I saw this the other day and thought of you.

76
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:16,211
Catches bad dreams.

77
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:20,256
That's kind of perfect.

78
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:23,801
Thank you.

79
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:25,803
No problem.

80
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:29,182
-Good seeing you.
-Yeah, I値l see you later.

81
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:30,391
Bye.

82
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:35,563
So how come Jacob Black
gets to give you a gift and I don't?

83
00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:39,609
Because I have nothing to give back to you.

84
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:43,112
Bella, you give me everything
just by breathing.

85
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:46,699
See? Thank you.

86
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:49,369
-That's all l want.
- Bella!

87
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,247
-Happy birthday!
-Shh, shh!

88
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,043
I thought I said no presents.

89
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:59,254
I've already seen you open it,
and guess what,

90
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:00,755
you love it.

91
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,633
You're gonna wear it tonight. Our place.

92
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:08,388
Come on. Please? It'll be fun.

93
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:14,394
-Okay. All right.
-Great!

94
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:16,604
Okay, I値l see you at 7:00.

95
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:21,609
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.

96
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:22,694
)

97
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:25,780
Sorry, Bella. Happy...

98
00:08:27,116 --> 00:08:28,491
Never mind.

99
00:08:30,786 --> 00:08:34,038
You can't trust vampires. Trust me.

100
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:37,083
O my love! My wife!

101
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:40,044
Death, that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath

102
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:42,547
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

103
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:45,592
Thou art not conquered.

104
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:50,972
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson
in thy lips and in thy cheeks.

105
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:54,642
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.

106
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:56,686
I hate being celebrated.

107
00:08:57,396 --> 00:09:00,315
There are worse tragedies.
l mean, look at Romeo.

108
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,359
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.

109
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,362
Yeah.

110
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:09,032
Though l do envy him one thing.

111
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:12,952
Juliet is, like, perfect.

112
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:16,289
lf you like
that obviously beautiful sort of thing.

113
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:22,545
Not the girl, the suicide.

114
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:28,718
It痴 nearly impossible for...

115
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:32,805
For some people.

116
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:38,728
For humans, a little poison,

117
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,815
a dagger to the heart.

118
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:46,694
There's so many different options.

119
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:51,866
Why would you say that?

120
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,662
Because I had to consider it once.

121
00:09:57,873 --> 00:09:59,916
I didn't know if I壇 get to you in time.

122
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:03,711
I had to come up with some kind of plan.

123
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:06,673
What was the plan?

124
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:10,218
That I壇 go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.

125
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:13,262
-The what?
-The Volturi.

126
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:16,808
.  Now, who'd like to repeat
the last few lines of iambic pentameter

127
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:19,435
just to show they were paying attention?

128
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,270
Mr. Cullen?

129
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:25,942
Yes, Mr. Berty.

130
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:32,532
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest

131
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:38,705
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh.

132
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,416
"Eyes, look your last.

133
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,293
"Arms, take your last embrace!

134
00:10:45,254 --> 00:10:48,131
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,

135
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,136
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless
bargain to engrossing death!"

136
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,473
Eyes on the screen, people.

137
00:10:59,143 --> 00:11:01,477
Thus with a kiss I die.

138
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:08,067
The Volturi are a very old,
very powerful family.

139
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:12,321
l guess they're the closest thing
to royalty my world has.

140
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,116
-Is that Carlisle?
-Yeah.

141
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:18,494
He lived with them for a few decades.

142
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:23,166
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course,

143
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:27,545
but a respect for the arts and the sciences,
at least.

144
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:30,631
And the law.

145
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:33,384
Above all, the law.

146
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:38,389
Vampires have laws?

147
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,559
Not very many.

148
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:45,563
And only one that's regularly enforced.

149
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:49,525
What is it?

150
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:53,696
That we keep the existence
of our kind a secret.

151
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:57,200
We don't make spectacles of ourselves,

152
00:11:59,077 --> 00:12:01,621
and we don't kill conspicuously.

153
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:08,002
Unless, of course, you want to die.

154
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,477
You gotta stop talking about that.

155
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:28,356
I can't even think
about someone hurting you.

156
00:12:30,943 --> 00:12:35,029
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me
is you.

157
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:39,867
And I don't have anything else
to be afraid of.

158
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:41,035
That's not true.

159
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:46,249
Victoria? She'll come for me one day.

160
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:51,671
Alice will see when she decides,
and we'll be ready.

161
00:12:51,922 --> 00:12:53,840
I could protect you

162
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,592
if you change me.

163
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:59,679
Bella, you already do protect me.

164
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,641
You're my only reason

165
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:07,061
to stay alive,

166
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:09,564
if that's what I am.

167
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,193
But it's my job to protect you.

168
00:13:17,781 --> 00:13:20,867
From everyone except my sister.

169
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:24,161
It痴 time! It痴 time. It痴 time. It痴 time!

170
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,667
Your lips are nettles

171
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:31,794
Your tongue is wine

172
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:34,881
You're left as liquid
But your body's pine

173
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:36,632
.  Sorry about all this.

174
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:39,552
-We tried to rein Alice in.
-As if that were even possible.

175
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:42,138
-Happy birthday, Bella.
-Thanks.

176
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,060
I found it in your bag. You mind?

177
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:51,063
Dating an older woman. Hot.

178
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:55,484
-What?
-You first, Rosalie.

179
00:13:58,363 --> 00:14:01,449
It痴 a necklace. Alice picked it out.

180
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:03,075
Thanks.

181
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:07,496
Show me the love.

182
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:13,210
This one's from Emmett.

183
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:18,174
Already installed it in your truck.

184
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,675
Finally a decent sound system

185
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,136
-for that piece of...
-Hey! Don't hate the truck.

186
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,262
)

187
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:25,514
Open Esme and Carlisle's.

188
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:29,268
.  Just a little something
to brighten your day.

189
00:14:29,353 --> 00:14:32,355
Yes, you've been looking
kind of pale lately.

190
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:38,611
Ow.

191
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:41,697
Paper cut.

192
00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:09,517
Jaz, Jaz. It痴 okay. It痴 just a little

193
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:13,229
blood.

194
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:21,654
.  Get Jasper out of here.

195
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:29,704
I知 sorry, I can't.

196
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,792
I値l have to stitch this up in my office.

197
00:15:37,087 --> 00:15:38,713
Check on Jasper.

198
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:40,965
I知 sure he's very upset with himself,

199
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:44,510
and I doubt he'll listen to anyone
but you right now.

200
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:45,803
Edward.

201
00:15:57,274 --> 00:16:00,776
l never wanted to have a party.
.  It痴 not your fault.

202
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:06,949
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood
as long as the rest of us.

203
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,326
How do you do it?

204
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:12,455
Years and years of practice.

205
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:16,834
Did you ever think
of just doing it the easy way?

206
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,754
No.

207
00:16:20,922 --> 00:16:24,341
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.

208
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,846
It brings me happiness,
even if l am damned regardless.

209
00:16:31,349 --> 00:16:32,683
Damned?

210
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:36,395
Like hell?

211
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:45,279
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.

212
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:47,948
You couldn't. It痴 impossible.

213
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,076
Thank you, Bella.

214
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,288
You've always been very gracious about us.

215
00:16:58,335 --> 00:17:01,629
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?

216
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:07,093
Imagine the situation in reverse. Hmm.

217
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,597
If you believed as Edward does,

218
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:15,184
could you take away his soul?

219
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,251
You can't protect me

220
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:44,046
from everything.

221
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:47,466
At some point,
something's gonna separate us.

222
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:51,804
It痴 gonna be an accident or illness

223
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:54,390
or old age,

224
00:17:56,143 --> 00:18:00,521
as long as I知 human.
And the only solution is to change me.

225
00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:05,734
That's not a solution. That's a tragedy.

226
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:09,446
You're not gonna want me
when I look like a grandmother.

227
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,960
Bella, do you not understand
my feelings for you at all?

228
00:18:25,714 --> 00:18:27,464
Carlisle told me

229
00:18:30,594 --> 00:18:32,720
how you feel about your soul.

230
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:36,098
I don't believe that.

231
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:39,435
So don't worry about mine.

232
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:42,396
You should go inside.

233
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,038
It痴 still my birthday.

234
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,668
So can I ask one thing?

235
00:19:08,256 --> 00:19:09,465
Kiss me?

236
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:46,293
I love you.

237
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:17,408
Up with your turret

238
00:20:19,703 --> 00:20:23,664
Aren't we just terrified?

239
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:38,846
Shale, screen your worry

240
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:43,892
From what you won't ever find

241
00:20:53,278 --> 00:21:01,577
Don't let it fool you

242
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:04,288
Down

243
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:09,418
Hey.

244
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:15,758
Just come take a walk with me.

245
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,450
We have to leave Forks.

246
00:21:44,746 --> 00:21:45,954
Why?

247
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:53,045
Carlisle's supposed to be 1 0 years older
than he looks,

248
00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:55,506
and people are starting to notice.

249
00:21:58,218 --> 00:22:02,179
Okay, I致e gotta think of something to say
to Charlie.

250
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,859
When you say "we"...

251
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:22,366
I mean my family and myself.

252
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:30,124
Edward, what happened with Jasper,
it's nothing.

253
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:33,168
You're right. It was nothing,

254
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:38,298
nothing but what l always expected

255
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:43,512
and nothing compared
to what could have happened.

256
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,354
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.

257
00:22:57,402 --> 00:22:59,111
I belong with you.

258
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,198
No. You don't.

259
00:23:05,702 --> 00:23:07,161
I知 coming.

260
00:23:08,204 --> 00:23:09,371
Bella,

261
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,125
I don't want you to come.

262
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:22,426
You don't want me?

263
00:23:28,183 --> 00:23:29,308
No.

264
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:36,398
That changes things a lot.

265
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:40,360
But if it's not too much to ask,

266
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:44,573
can you just promise me something?

267
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:49,161
Don't do anything reckless.

268
00:23:51,915 --> 00:23:53,707
For Charlie's sake.

269
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:58,086
And I値l promise something to you in return.

270
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:01,006
This is the last time you'll ever see me.

271
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:03,217
I won't come back,

272
00:24:03,551 --> 00:24:07,596
and you can go on with your life
without any interference from me.

273
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:12,184
It will be like l never existed, I promise.

274
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:19,358
lf this is about my soul, take it.
l don't want it without you.

275
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:21,485
It痴 not about your soul.

276
00:24:24,614 --> 00:24:26,949
You're just not good for me.

277
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:30,494
Not good enough for you.

278
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:34,373
I知 just sorry l let this go on for so long.

279
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:37,584
Please...

280
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:40,420
Don't...

281
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,052
Goodbye.

282
00:25:02,694 --> 00:25:23,505
Edward.

283
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:27,843
Edward!

284
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,019
Edward.

285
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:35,345
I知 gonna try the Cullens' place again.

286
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:39,141
- The Cullens left town, Charlie.
-Good riddance.

287
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:40,934
Where'd they go?

288
00:27:41,936 --> 00:27:43,812
We'll find her, Charlie.

289
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:46,231
-Thanks, Harry.
-Charlie!

290
00:27:46,482 --> 00:27:47,607
Hey.

291
00:27:50,862 --> 00:27:52,487
She's all right.

292
00:27:53,322 --> 00:27:56,825
I got her. Thank you, Sam.

293
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:51,588
There's a possibility

294
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:58,053
All that I had

295
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:01,723
Was all I知 gonna get

296
00:29:06,729 --> 00:29:10,065
Alice, you've disappeared,

297
00:29:12,693 --> 00:29:14,653
like everything else.

298
00:29:15,905 --> 00:29:18,615
Now who else can I talk to? I知 lost.

299
00:29:25,706 --> 00:29:27,332
When you left,

300
00:29:29,252 --> 00:29:30,919
and he left,

301
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,507
you took everything with you.

302
00:29:37,593 --> 00:29:40,637
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.

303
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,523
It痴 like a huge hole has been punched
through my chest.

304
00:29:57,154 --> 00:29:58,280
Bella.

305
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:16,423
But in a way I知 glad.

306
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:20,051
The pain is my only reminder
that he was real,

307
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:21,803
that you all were.

308
00:30:30,605 --> 00:30:32,731
All right. That's it.

309
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:36,610
What?

310
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:40,322
You're going to Jacksonville
to live with your mother.

311
00:30:42,658 --> 00:30:44,618
I知 not leaving Forks.

312
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:49,789
Bells, he's not coming back.

313
00:30:52,877 --> 00:30:54,127
I know.

314
00:30:55,338 --> 00:30:58,173
It痴 just not normal, this behavior.

315
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:02,677
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me
and your mother.

316
00:31:04,347 --> 00:31:06,681
Baby, I don't want you to leave.

317
00:31:07,016 --> 00:31:11,770
I don't, but just go. Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.

318
00:31:11,854 --> 00:31:13,521
I like my old friends.

319
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:16,358
-Well, you never see them anymore.
-I do.

320
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:24,115
I知 gonna go shopping tomorrow
with Jessica.

321
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:28,119
-You hate shopping.
-I...

322
00:31:29,872 --> 00:31:31,998
I need a girls' night out.

323
00:31:34,835 --> 00:31:37,629
All right. Girls' night.

324
00:31:39,048 --> 00:31:40,382
Shopping.

325
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:44,886
I like it. Go buy some stuff.

326
00:31:53,229 --> 00:31:55,230
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.

327
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:58,358
Yeah, Bella Swan.

328
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:04,823
I don't know why you want to
sit through

329
00:32:04,907 --> 00:32:08,159
all those zombies eating people
and no hot guys kissing anybody.

330
00:32:08,244 --> 00:32:11,788
It痴 gross. Like... And why are there
that many zombie movies anyway?

331
00:32:11,872 --> 00:32:14,457
'Cause if it's supposed to, like,
draw a parallel about leprosy,

332
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:17,502
my cousin had leprosy.
It痴 not funny, you know?

333
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:20,505
And, like, is it supposed to be
a metaphor for consumerism?

334
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:22,757
Because don't be so pleased
with your own, like,

335
00:32:22,842 --> 00:32:25,468
self-referential cleverness, you know?

336
00:32:25,553 --> 00:32:29,014
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.

337
00:32:29,098 --> 00:32:32,100
Although I was surprised
you even called at all. You know?

338
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:35,311
Like, your depression thing,
I get it. I知 totally, totally worried.

339
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:36,396
But after a while it's like,

340
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,981
-you're still bumming...
- You want a ride, girls?

341
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:40,025
...and I知 going through stuff, too.
You know? Like Mike deciding

342
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:41,192
he just wants to be friends.

343
00:32:41,277 --> 00:32:42,235
What's up? Look what we found.

344
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,528
It痴 hard, you know?

345
00:32:43,612 --> 00:32:44,904
Like, and since when does "just friends"...

346
00:32:44,989 --> 00:32:46,531
1 : What's up guys?
2: Look what we found.

347
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:48,658
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, where you going?

348
00:32:56,751 --> 00:32:57,709
Keep walking.

349
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:01,504
This is dangerous.

350
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:13,641
-Dude, come on.
- Come here for a sec!

351
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,814
I think I know those guys.

352
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:22,734
We got beer! We got bikes!

353
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,904
Well, they seem great. Can we go?

354
00:33:26,822 --> 00:33:29,157
I知 just gonna see something.

355
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:31,659
Hey, girlie!

356
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:38,792
All right, all right. We got a taker.

357
00:33:39,502 --> 00:33:40,919
Turn around.

358
00:33:55,684 --> 00:33:57,977
2: Shut up!
3: You shut up!

359
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:05,485
I知 sorry, I thought you
were somebody else.

360
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:08,404
No, that's cool.
I値l be whoever you want me to be, honey.

361
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:11,157
So, what do you say?

362
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:18,289
You promised me, nothing reckless.

363
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:25,463
You promised it would be
as if you never existed.

364
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,721
-You lied.
-You say something, babe?

365
00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:35,306
You know what? Never mind.

366
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:55,076
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

367
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:08,006
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?

368
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,757
Just curious.

369
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,179
-l thought that l saw something.
-You... Oh.

370
00:35:14,597 --> 00:35:17,891
You're insane, actually. Or suicidal.

371
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:20,977
That homeboy could've been a psycho.

372
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,440
I was about to end up in an
interview room like some lame  show.

373
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:27,775
God, that was such a rush.

374
00:35:29,486 --> 00:35:32,030
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?

375
00:35:32,114 --> 00:35:33,364
That's cool. You can go bungee jumping.

376
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:36,701
You don't get on the back
of some random loser's motorcycle.

377
00:35:36,785 --> 00:35:37,952
Crazy.

378
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:45,126
Alice, I saw him.

379
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:50,048
Maybe I知 crazy now. I guess that's okay.

380
00:35:52,176 --> 00:35:55,428
If a rush of danger
is what it takes to see him,

381
00:35:55,512 --> 00:35:57,764
then that's what I値l find.

382
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:03,019
Bella!

383
00:36:04,104 --> 00:36:06,189
Where the hell have you been, loca?

384
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:12,695
I brought you something.

385
00:36:13,364 --> 00:36:15,990
-Okay.
-It痴 a little crazy.

386
00:36:21,038 --> 00:36:22,121
Wow.

387
00:36:22,498 --> 00:36:24,707
Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.

388
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:27,001
I saved it from the junkyard.

389
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:33,132
I think they'll probably cost more to fix
than they're worth,

390
00:36:33,384 --> 00:36:35,635
but then I thought that
if l had a mechanic friend

391
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:36,970
-to help me out then...
-Ah!

392
00:36:37,054 --> 00:36:40,431
-Me being the mechanic-type friend?
-That's right.

393
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,644
-Since when are you into motorcycles?
-Since now.

394
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:53,903
I get it if you think that
this is really stupid and reckless.

395
00:36:53,988 --> 00:36:57,031
Yeah, I mean,
it's completely stupid and reckless.

396
00:37:00,035 --> 00:37:01,661
When do we start?

397
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:04,914
Um.

398
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:07,041
Now.

399
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:09,711
-Please?
- All right.

400
00:37:12,172 --> 00:37:16,509
Oh, hey, be careful.
Those things are actually really heavy, so...

401
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:24,100
Jake, you're, like, buff.

402
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:26,436
How did that happen?
You're, like, 16. I don't get it.

403
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,856
Mmm-hmm. Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, like, 40 now?

404
00:37:34,194 --> 00:37:36,487
It feels like that sometimes.

405
00:37:46,707 --> 00:37:49,417
That song's good. You don't like it?

406
00:37:50,544 --> 00:37:54,922
I don't really like music anymore, kind of.

407
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:58,092
Okay. No more music.

408
00:38:01,263 --> 00:38:03,348
So I was thinking,
if we're gonna do this every day,

409
00:38:03,432 --> 00:38:05,266
and hopefully we will,

410
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:08,061
we have to, like,
fit some homework in there somewhere.

411
00:38:08,145 --> 00:38:11,189
I don't want Billy thinking that
I知 a bad influence on you.

412
00:38:11,273 --> 00:38:14,400
You? Influence me? Please.

413
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:19,280
Are you... I知 older than you,

414
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:22,700
so that makes me the influencer
and you the influence.

415
00:38:22,785 --> 00:38:24,369
No, no, no.

416
00:38:24,453 --> 00:38:28,206
My size and knowledge base
actually makes me older than you

417
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,792
because of your general paleness
and lack of know-how.

418
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,378
I convinced you to build
two-wheeled death machines with me.

419
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:37,006
Don't you think that makes you
kind of young and naive?

420
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:39,300
Okay. So where do we stand?

421
00:38:40,302 --> 00:38:43,262
-I知 35. And you might be, like, 32.
-Come on.

422
00:38:44,473 --> 00:38:48,059
- Yo, Jake, you in there?
-It痴 okay. It痴 just my boys.

423
00:38:48,143 --> 00:38:50,895
-Hey, Jake.
-Hey. Guys, this is Bella.

424
00:38:50,979 --> 00:38:53,523
-Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
-Hi.

425
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:55,983
I知 Quil Ateara.

426
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,987
So the bike building story is true.

427
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:02,156
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I taught him everything he knows.

428
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:05,034
What about the part
where you're his girlfriend?

429
00:39:05,661 --> 00:39:06,661
Uh...

430
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:08,579
We're friends, you know.

431
00:39:08,664 --> 00:39:10,289
- Burn.
-Actually,

432
00:39:10,374 --> 00:39:13,251
remember I said she's a girl and a friend.

433
00:39:13,335 --> 00:39:15,211
Embry, do you remember him
making that distinction?

434
00:39:15,295 --> 00:39:16,254
Nope.

435
00:39:16,338 --> 00:39:18,840
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.

436
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:23,636
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.

437
00:39:24,263 --> 00:39:25,430
Yeah, that's still a riot.

438
00:39:25,514 --> 00:39:28,474
You want funny, Black? I値l give you funny.

439
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,102
Jeez.

440
00:39:31,186 --> 00:39:32,520
Hey, that hold's illegal!

441
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:34,605
I got five bucks on Quil.

442
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,315
You're on.

443
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,822
All of the astronauts
Champagne in plastic cups

444
00:39:42,906 --> 00:39:47,201
Waiting for the big hero to show

445
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:52,373
Outside the door he stands
His head in his hands

446
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:55,626
And his heart in his throat

447
00:39:55,711 --> 00:39:58,754
What can he tell them now

448
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:00,339
Dear Alice,

449
00:40:00,424 --> 00:40:02,800
I wish I had your real address.

450
00:40:03,218 --> 00:40:05,803
I wish I could tell you about Jake.

451
00:40:06,054 --> 00:40:08,264
He makes me feel better.

452
00:40:09,433 --> 00:40:11,893
I mean, he makes me feel alive.

453
00:40:14,438 --> 00:40:16,564
The hole in my chest,

454
00:40:17,232 --> 00:40:21,694
well, when I知 with Jake,
it's like it's almost healed

455
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:24,155
for a while.

456
00:40:24,406 --> 00:40:28,743
So, Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.

457
00:40:29,244 --> 00:40:30,244
Oh.

458
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:34,916
Well, I知 really not into
the whole cougar thing. You know?

459
00:40:37,085 --> 00:40:39,086
What's up with you and age?

460
00:40:39,588 --> 00:40:42,548
I mean,
how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?

461
00:40:45,135 --> 00:40:48,012
But even Jake can't keep
the dreams away.

462
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,397
Hey, hey, hey!

463
00:40:59,107 --> 00:41:00,274
Wake up, Bella.

464
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:03,027
You're okay. You're okay.

465
00:41:14,122 --> 00:41:18,543
I thought this thing was starting to work,
but I guess not.

466
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:26,968
Can I ask you something?

467
00:41:28,971 --> 00:41:30,888
Hanging out with Jacob,

468
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:35,518
that seems to take your mind
off things a bit, doesn't it?

469
00:41:40,566 --> 00:41:42,316
You know, sometimes

470
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:47,363
you gotta learn to love what's good for you.

471
00:41:48,282 --> 00:41:50,116
You know what I mean?

472
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,662
Of course, what do I know?

473
00:41:55,038 --> 00:41:57,331
I知 just a terminal bachelor.

474
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:01,627
Famous ladies' man.

475
00:42:04,172 --> 00:42:05,298
Okay.

476
00:42:07,175 --> 00:42:08,801
I知 gonna go to bed.

477
00:42:09,511 --> 00:42:10,511
Uh...

478
00:42:11,013 --> 00:42:12,430
I love you.

479
00:42:18,562 --> 00:42:23,107
lf l told you l couldn't have fixed
these bikes, what would you have said?

480
00:42:25,527 --> 00:42:27,945
Are you doubting your mad skills?

481
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:31,991
No. Definitely not. I mean, they'll run fine.

482
00:42:32,909 --> 00:42:34,368
It痴 just,

483
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:40,082
maybe if I was smart,
I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.

484
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:49,216
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes,
I would say that that's really too bad,

485
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:53,179
but that we're just gonna
have to find something else to do.

486
00:42:58,352 --> 00:43:00,061
Is that Sam Uley?

487
00:43:01,063 --> 00:43:03,439
Yeah. Him and his cult.

488
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:07,777
Oh, my God.

489
00:43:10,864 --> 00:43:12,573
Did you see that?

490
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:22,166
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.

491
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,752
Scary as hell, but a total rush.

492
00:43:28,048 --> 00:43:30,841
-A rush?
-Most of us jump from lower down.

493
00:43:30,926 --> 00:43:34,261
We leave the showing off
to Sam and his disciples.

494
00:43:36,473 --> 00:43:39,767
You have some kind of beef with him
or something?

495
00:43:40,936 --> 00:43:42,436
l don't know.

496
00:43:42,521 --> 00:43:45,106
They just think they run this place.

497
00:43:45,524 --> 00:43:48,401
Embry used to call them
hall monitors on steroids.

498
00:43:48,485 --> 00:43:50,945
-Now look at him.
-That's Embry?

499
00:43:52,781 --> 00:43:55,116
-Yeah.
-What happened to him?

500
00:43:55,617 --> 00:43:57,159
He missed some school.

501
00:43:57,244 --> 00:44:01,330
Now all of a sudden, he started
following Sam around like a little puppy.

502
00:44:01,415 --> 00:44:04,250
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.

503
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,002
Sam keeps giving me this look,

504
00:44:09,089 --> 00:44:11,799
like he's waiting for me or something.

505
00:44:13,093 --> 00:44:15,803
It痴 kind of starting to freak me out.

506
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:18,305
Well, you should just avoid him.

507
00:44:20,308 --> 00:44:21,642
I try.

508
00:44:38,785 --> 00:44:40,119
Okay.

509
00:44:43,206 --> 00:44:45,332
-You look scared.
-I知 not.

510
00:44:46,793 --> 00:44:48,085
All right.

511
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,171
-Brake?
-That one.

512
00:44:53,508 --> 00:44:54,884
Clutch?

513
00:44:54,968 --> 00:44:56,177
Good.

514
00:44:56,511 --> 00:44:57,636
Gas?

515
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,390
Ready?

516
00:45:02,517 --> 00:45:05,603
Now, slowly release the clutch.

517
00:45:07,606 --> 00:45:08,814
Bella.

518
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,360
Stop.

519
00:45:15,238 --> 00:45:16,238
Whoa!

520
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,284
You all right?

521
00:45:21,578 --> 00:45:23,370
I知 gonna go again.

522
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:24,955
Okay.

523
00:45:38,553 --> 00:45:39,553
Ah!

524
00:45:41,014 --> 00:45:42,014
Whoa!

525
00:45:43,725 --> 00:45:45,226
Hit the brake!

526
00:45:59,825 --> 00:46:00,825
I wanna go again.

527
00:46:00,909 --> 00:46:02,660
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

528
00:46:02,744 --> 00:46:05,287
-No. l want to go again.
-No. Forget it.

529
00:46:06,081 --> 00:46:07,748
No more bikes.

530
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:10,251
Man, your head.

531
00:46:10,877 --> 00:46:11,877
Ow.

532
00:46:13,296 --> 00:46:15,548
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God, I知 sorry.

533
00:46:16,758 --> 00:46:19,426
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?

534
00:46:21,596 --> 00:46:23,389
Yeah. I guess I am.

535
00:46:24,266 --> 00:46:27,142
Well, it's just blood, Bella. No big deal.

536
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,691
There.

537
00:46:40,282 --> 00:46:42,324
What are you staring at?

538
00:46:45,704 --> 00:46:47,830
You're sort of beautiful.

539
00:46:55,714 --> 00:46:58,048
How hard did you hit your head?

540
00:46:59,509 --> 00:47:00,551
I don't know.

541
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:04,305
Let's go.

542
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:09,226
I did see something in the woods.

543
00:47:09,769 --> 00:47:11,145
Totally. Baby, l believe you.

544
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:13,522
No, he doesn't. He's just trying to get lucky.

545
00:47:14,941 --> 00:47:18,944
No, okay. It was jet black and huge.

546
00:47:19,029 --> 00:47:21,864
On all fours, it was still taller than a person.

547
00:47:21,948 --> 00:47:23,115
A bear, maybe?

548
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:25,659
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.

549
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:29,079
Well, I saw it.

550
00:47:29,831 --> 00:47:31,832
You know, you're not the only one.

551
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:35,294
My dad's been getting reports at the station.

552
00:47:35,378 --> 00:47:38,297
Like, five hikers have been killed
by some bear.

553
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:40,507
But they can't find the bear.

554
00:47:40,592 --> 00:47:41,592
Hmm.

555
00:47:43,678 --> 00:47:46,555
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.

556
00:47:47,307 --> 00:47:48,265
Um...

557
00:47:50,685 --> 00:47:52,144
So? I mean,

558
00:47:52,979 --> 00:47:54,605
Bella's back?

559
00:47:58,401 --> 00:47:59,985
Yeah, I guess so.

560
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:02,655
All right, that's... Well, welcome.

561
00:48:03,657 --> 00:48:06,742
So, listen, now that you're talking

562
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:12,915
and eating again, which, you know,
you've got to get that protein in there,

563
00:48:15,043 --> 00:48:19,254
I was just wondering if you wanted to go
see a movie with me.

564
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:25,928
Yeah. Sure. Yeah, l do.

565
00:48:27,806 --> 00:48:29,056
Cool.

566
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,642
Let me see, we could check out

567
00:48:32,227 --> 00:48:34,478
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.

568
00:48:34,562 --> 00:48:37,648
You know, it's a dumb title,
but it's a romantic comedy.

569
00:48:37,732 --> 00:48:40,567
-I mean, it's supposed to be pretty...
-No. No romance.

570
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:47,741
How about Face Punch?
Have you heard of that?

571
00:48:48,576 --> 00:48:50,995
I mean, that's an action movie.

572
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:52,913
Yeah, that's perfect.

573
00:48:53,748 --> 00:48:55,582
Guns, adrenaline.

574
00:48:56,418 --> 00:48:57,668
That's my thing.

575
00:48:57,752 --> 00:48:58,919
Okay.

576
00:48:59,254 --> 00:49:03,590
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see Face Punch?

577
00:49:03,675 --> 00:49:04,883
Face Punch, yeah!

578
00:49:04,968 --> 00:49:06,468
Mike, hey,
we were supposed to watch that.

579
00:49:06,553 --> 00:49:08,095
Remember, the trailer's like...

580
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,389
-"Punch faces."
-I remember.

581
00:49:10,473 --> 00:49:13,183
Yeah!
Movie night with Bella.

582
00:49:16,438 --> 00:49:18,272
So Face Punch, huh?

583
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,941
You like action movies?

584
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,360
Not really.

585
00:49:26,322 --> 00:49:29,116
I heard it sucks. Bad.

586
00:49:30,618 --> 00:49:33,495
Are you even old enough to see this movie?

587
00:49:34,456 --> 00:49:36,206
I mean, you know, without,
like, adult supervision.

588
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:38,208
Right, yeah, well,
she's buying my ticket for me.

589
00:49:38,293 --> 00:49:40,252
She's buying it. Okay.

590
00:49:41,337 --> 00:49:44,298
Jessica bailed,
and Angela got the stomach flu,

591
00:49:44,382 --> 00:49:46,633
so Eric's taking care of her.

592
00:49:47,635 --> 00:49:49,803
-It痴 just us three.
-Great!

593
00:49:50,889 --> 00:49:52,431
-Great.
-Yeah.

594
00:49:55,602 --> 00:49:56,894
1   Put your gun down.

595
00:49:56,978 --> 00:49:59,688
2   Put your gun down
or I知 gonna blow your frickin' head off.

596
00:49:59,773 --> 00:50:02,232
3   Both of you put both
of your guns down

597
00:50:02,317 --> 00:50:05,027
or I知 gonna blow both
of your frickin' heads off.

598
00:50:06,446 --> 00:50:07,905
1   All right, forget it,
let's do this!

599
00:50:26,341 --> 00:50:28,842
Okay, I think I知 gonna throw up.

600
00:50:35,058 --> 00:50:36,350
He's...

601
00:50:36,726 --> 00:50:38,519
What a marshmallow!

602
00:50:39,687 --> 00:50:43,107
You should hold out for someone
with a stronger stomach.

603
00:50:43,191 --> 00:50:46,652
Someone who laughs at the gore
that makes weaker men vomit.

604
00:50:46,736 --> 00:50:48,570
Yeah. I値l keep my eye open for that.

605
00:50:50,865 --> 00:50:55,202
I feel bad. He probably has
that flu that's going around.

606
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,874
What? I can't hold your hand?

607
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:03,001
No, of course you can.

608
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,883
I just think it means, you know,
something a little different to you. So...

609
00:51:12,053 --> 00:51:15,472
Okay, well, tell me something.
You like me, right?

610
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:22,980
And you think I知 sort of beautiful?

611
00:51:24,065 --> 00:51:27,693
Jacob, please, don't do this.

612
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:35,576
Why?

613
00:51:38,997 --> 00:51:41,790
Because you're about to ruin everything.

614
00:51:43,626 --> 00:51:46,253
And I need you.

615
00:51:53,178 --> 00:51:55,637
Well, I致e got loads of time.

616
00:51:56,764 --> 00:51:58,682
I知 not gonna give up.

617
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:02,436
I don't want you to,

618
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:07,900
but it's just 'cause I don't want you
to go anywhere.

619
00:52:10,445 --> 00:52:12,696
And that's really selfish.

620
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:19,453
You know,
I知 not like a car that you can fix up.

621
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:27,628
I知 never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.

622
00:52:30,048 --> 00:52:32,299
It痴 because of him, right?

623
00:52:42,602 --> 00:52:43,810
Look,

624
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,898
I know what he did to you.

625
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:53,487
But, Bella, l would never ever do that.

626
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:59,409
I won't ever hurt you. l promise.

627
00:53:00,912 --> 00:53:02,829
I won't let you down.

628
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:05,666
You can count on me.

629
00:53:13,508 --> 00:53:14,508
Well,

630
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:21,682
I need to go home.

631
00:53:28,815 --> 00:53:31,692
I was feeling sick before the movie. Okay?

632
00:53:34,904 --> 00:53:36,238
What is your problem?

633
00:53:36,322 --> 00:53:38,573
Right now? You're my problem.

634
00:53:39,242 --> 00:53:42,577
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.

635
00:53:43,705 --> 00:53:45,539
You want me to put you in the hospital?

636
00:53:45,623 --> 00:53:48,959
Jake! Jake. Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?

637
00:53:49,377 --> 00:53:52,004
You're really hot.

638
00:53:53,548 --> 00:53:56,842
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?

639
00:53:57,844 --> 00:54:00,137
I don't know what's happening.

640
00:54:02,098 --> 00:54:03,598
I gotta go.

641
00:54:08,688 --> 00:54:10,397
That dude is weird.

642
00:54:13,901 --> 00:54:16,570
Jake,
your dad says you have mono.

643
00:54:17,155 --> 00:54:20,324
He won't let me visit,
but would you call me?

644
00:54:25,872 --> 00:54:28,498
Hey, it's me again. I just...

645
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:32,461
I知 sorry about what I said
at the movie theater.

646
00:54:33,546 --> 00:54:36,757
I just wanted to hear your voice,
so no pressure.

647
00:54:39,886 --> 00:54:41,303
Jacob, please...

648
00:54:43,264 --> 00:54:44,639
Call me.

649
00:54:44,724 --> 00:54:47,351
Okay. We should be back around 3:00.

650
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,567
Hey.

651
00:54:56,486 --> 00:54:58,487
Look, l don't have to go fishing today.

652
00:54:58,571 --> 00:54:59,988
Yes, you do.

653
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:02,991
Yeah, you do.
Go. What are you talking about?

654
00:55:03,076 --> 00:55:04,743
Just be careful.

655
00:55:04,827 --> 00:55:06,286
Always am.

656
00:55:07,955 --> 00:55:10,457
Those bears won't get the drop on me,
Bella.

657
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,542
My kung fu is strong.

658
00:55:45,785 --> 00:55:46,952
Jake!

659
00:55:47,954 --> 00:55:49,204
Hey!

660
00:55:54,043 --> 00:55:56,002
You cut your hair off?

661
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,674
And got a tattoo?

662
00:56:04,011 --> 00:56:05,220
Bella.

663
00:56:05,304 --> 00:56:08,265
l thought you were too sick to come outside

664
00:56:09,183 --> 00:56:11,893
or pick up the phone when l call.

665
00:56:13,146 --> 00:56:14,479
Go away.

666
00:56:15,815 --> 00:56:16,982
What?

667
00:56:18,651 --> 00:56:19,985
Go away.

668
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:24,114
What happened to you? What's...

669
00:56:24,198 --> 00:56:26,491
Hey! What happened?

670
00:56:29,454 --> 00:56:32,497
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?

671
00:56:32,582 --> 00:56:35,876
Sam's trying to help me. Don't blame him.

672
00:56:37,003 --> 00:56:39,463
But if you want somebody to blame,

673
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:43,550
how about those filthy bloodsuckers
you love, the Cullens?

674
00:56:50,766 --> 00:56:51,892
l don't know what you're talking about.

675
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:54,686
No, you know exactly
what I知 talking about.

676
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:57,564
You've been lying to everyone. Charlie.

677
00:56:59,859 --> 00:57:01,902
But you can't lie to me.

678
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:05,155
-Not anymore, Bella.
- Jacob!

679
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:07,157
Jacob!

680
00:57:13,206 --> 00:57:14,706
Look, Bella,

681
00:57:15,917 --> 00:57:18,251
we can't be friends anymore.

682
00:57:19,128 --> 00:57:22,923
Look, Jake,
l know that I致e been hurting you.

683
00:57:24,592 --> 00:57:27,594
It痴 killing me. It kills me.

684
00:57:29,889 --> 00:57:32,682
l just need... Maybe give me, like,

685
00:57:32,767 --> 00:57:34,768
-some time or something.
-Look, don't.

686
00:57:35,728 --> 00:57:37,270
It痴 not you.

687
00:57:40,149 --> 00:57:43,068
It痴 not you, it's me, right? Really?

688
00:57:43,986 --> 00:57:46,321
It痴 true. It is me.

689
00:57:49,283 --> 00:57:51,409
I知 not good.

690
00:57:54,205 --> 00:57:57,415
l used to be a good kid.

691
00:57:58,751 --> 00:58:00,126
Not anymore.

692
00:58:01,295 --> 00:58:03,922
This doesn't even matter. All right?

693
00:58:04,215 --> 00:58:05,215
This is over.

694
00:58:05,299 --> 00:58:07,467
You can't break up with me.

695
00:58:09,387 --> 00:58:10,637
l mean...

696
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:14,307
l mean, you're my best friend.

697
00:58:16,811 --> 00:58:18,562
You promised me.

698
00:58:20,022 --> 00:58:21,356
l know.

699
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:24,943
l promised l wouldn't hurt you, Bella.

700
00:58:25,778 --> 00:58:28,321
And this is me keeping that promise.

701
00:58:29,115 --> 00:58:30,448
Go home

702
00:58:31,158 --> 00:58:34,619
and don't come back
or you're gonna get hurt.

703
00:58:48,134 --> 00:58:49,467
Alice,

704
00:58:50,511 --> 00:58:52,012
things are...

705
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:55,515
Things are bad again.

706
00:58:56,726 --> 00:58:59,853
Without Jake, l just... l can't stand it.

707
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:05,483
l don't see Edward anymore.

708
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:09,863
Will it really feel like he never existed?

709
00:59:17,371 --> 00:59:20,540
l will find the place
where l can see him again.

710
01:00:15,805 --> 01:00:17,013
Bella.

711
01:00:18,057 --> 01:00:19,307
Laurent.

712
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:23,812
l didn't expect to find you here.

713
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:30,276
l went to visit the Cullens,
but the house is empty.

714
01:00:32,613 --> 01:00:35,115
I知 surprised they left you behind.

715
01:00:35,324 --> 01:00:37,325
Weren't you sort of

716
01:00:38,452 --> 01:00:40,078
a pet of theirs?

717
01:00:41,038 --> 01:00:42,580
Yeah. You could say that.

718
01:00:42,665 --> 01:00:44,999
Do the Cullens visit often?

719
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:51,214
Lie.

720
01:00:56,804 --> 01:00:58,096
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.

721
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,723
Lie better.

722
01:00:59,807 --> 01:01:02,434
I値l tell them that you stopped by.

723
01:01:03,018 --> 01:01:05,228
But l probably shouldn't

724
01:01:05,688 --> 01:01:08,356
tell Edward,

725
01:01:10,151 --> 01:01:11,526
'cause he's pretty protective.

726
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,820
But he's far away, isn't he?

727
01:01:16,699 --> 01:01:18,450
Why are you here?

728
01:01:18,534 --> 01:01:22,912
I came as a favor to Victoria.

729
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:27,917
-Victoria?
-She asked me to see

730
01:01:28,002 --> 01:01:31,588
if you were still under
the protection of the Cullens.

731
01:01:31,672 --> 01:01:35,091
Victoria feels it's only fair
to kill Edward's mate,

732
01:01:35,634 --> 01:01:37,302
given he killed hers.

733
01:01:37,386 --> 01:01:39,179
An eye for an eye.

734
01:01:39,847 --> 01:01:41,014
Threaten him.

735
01:01:41,098 --> 01:01:44,601
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.

736
01:01:45,644 --> 01:01:47,562
l don't think he will.

737
01:01:48,773 --> 01:01:51,733
After all, how much could you mean to him

738
01:01:52,193 --> 01:01:54,694
if he left you here unprotected?

739
01:01:57,031 --> 01:02:00,033
Victoria won't be happy
about my killing you,

740
01:02:00,117 --> 01:02:02,118
but l can't help myself.

741
01:02:02,411 --> 01:02:04,162
You are so mouth-watering.

742
01:02:04,246 --> 01:02:07,957
-Please, don't. l mean, you helped us.
-No, no, no, no.

743
01:02:09,168 --> 01:02:12,420
Don't be afraid. I知 doing you a kindness.

744
01:02:12,713 --> 01:02:15,381
Victoria plans on killing you
slowly,

745
01:02:16,675 --> 01:02:18,009
painfully,

746
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:21,221
whereas I値l make it quick.

747
01:02:21,555 --> 01:02:22,931
l promise.

748
01:02:23,933 --> 01:02:25,934
You will feel nothing.

749
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,316
Edward, l love you.

750
01:02:35,694 --> 01:02:37,362
l don't believe it.

751
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,973
-Dad! l saw them.
-What's the matter?

752
01:03:47,057 --> 01:03:50,059
-In the woods. They're not bears.
-What do you mean "in the woods"?

753
01:03:50,144 --> 01:03:51,895
Bell, what the hell
were you doing out in the woods?

754
01:03:51,979 --> 01:03:55,690
They're wolves.
l mean, they're like huge wolves.

755
01:03:55,774 --> 01:03:57,609
Are you sure about that, Bella?

756
01:03:57,693 --> 01:04:00,904
Yeah! l just saw them.
They were after something.

757
01:04:02,114 --> 01:04:03,323
Wolves?

758
01:04:04,491 --> 01:04:05,992
You saw them?

759
01:04:08,621 --> 01:04:11,164
All right, well, Harry,

760
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:15,793
feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?

761
01:04:16,253 --> 01:04:18,296
Sure, yeah, I値l just...

762
01:04:20,049 --> 01:04:21,883
By now, those wolves will be dead,

763
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:26,554
and Laurent would have told her
I知 unprotected.

764
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:27,889
Victoria.

765
01:04:29,642 --> 01:04:31,100
l should go to the station.

766
01:04:31,185 --> 01:04:33,645
Yeah, you should. You should go.

767
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:36,648
Can you just stay in the house?

768
01:05:01,674 --> 01:05:02,924
Bella!

769
01:05:05,594 --> 01:05:07,011
You scared me.

770
01:05:07,096 --> 01:05:10,556
-What the hell are you doing?
-Back up. I知 coming up.

771
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:24,028
Hey.

772
01:05:26,198 --> 01:05:27,907
Look, I知 sorry.

773
01:05:34,957 --> 01:05:37,250
-For what?
-l wish l could explain.

774
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:40,461
But l literally can't.

775
01:05:49,221 --> 01:05:52,598
Have you ever had a secret
you couldn't tell anyone,

776
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:55,977
one that wasn't yours to share?

777
01:05:58,897 --> 01:06:01,441
Well, that's what it's like for me.

778
01:06:01,692 --> 01:06:03,026
But worse.

779
01:06:04,403 --> 01:06:07,780
You have no idea how tight I知 bound.

780
01:06:08,949 --> 01:06:10,408
l hate this.

781
01:06:11,326 --> 01:06:13,327
l hate what they've done to you.

782
01:06:27,801 --> 01:06:30,887
l mean, the killer part is, you already know.

783
01:06:34,975 --> 01:06:39,687
Bella, do you remember
when we walked on the beach at La Push?

784
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:42,523
The...

785
01:06:46,528 --> 01:06:49,197
The story. The story about

786
01:06:50,491 --> 01:06:52,158
the cold ones.

787
01:06:53,869 --> 01:06:57,622
l guess l understand
why that's the only part you remember.

788
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:08,466
There's gotta be something that you can do.

789
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:10,593
No. I知 in it for life.

790
01:07:12,012 --> 01:07:14,639
Well, maybe we should just
get out of here for a while.

791
01:07:14,723 --> 01:07:16,599
Just leave,

792
01:07:16,683 --> 01:07:18,309
just you and me.

793
01:07:18,727 --> 01:07:20,353
You'd do that?

794
01:07:23,482 --> 01:07:25,441
l would do it for you.

795
01:07:31,698 --> 01:07:35,076
It痴 not something
l can just run away from, Bella.

796
01:07:36,036 --> 01:07:39,539
But l would run away with you

797
01:07:43,794 --> 01:07:45,211
if l could.

798
01:07:49,341 --> 01:07:52,552
l gotta go.
They'll start wondering where l am.

799
01:07:56,723 --> 01:07:58,224
Come here.

800
01:08:02,479 --> 01:08:03,771
Please,

801
01:08:04,815 --> 01:08:06,607
try to remember.

802
01:08:08,235 --> 01:08:10,361
It'd be so much easier

803
01:08:11,572 --> 01:08:13,197
if you knew.

804
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:18,202
I値l try. But, Jake...

805
01:08:18,996 --> 01:08:21,747
Jake, what are you doing? Wait, Jake.

806
01:08:28,881 --> 01:08:30,047
Jake.

807
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:48,691
Edward, I知 scared.

808
01:08:49,276 --> 01:08:50,902
You should be.

809
01:08:55,949 --> 01:08:57,867
Really, it's just like an old story.

810
01:08:57,951 --> 01:08:59,827
I知 not really supposed
to say anything about it.

811
01:08:59,912 --> 01:09:03,706
Did you know Quileutes
are supposedly descended from wolves?

812
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:19,805
Bella?

813
01:09:20,224 --> 01:09:21,974
l need to see him.

814
01:09:22,684 --> 01:09:24,227
He's not in.

815
01:09:25,896 --> 01:09:29,190
-Okay, I知 sorry, l really need to see him.
-Bella!

816
01:09:45,165 --> 01:09:46,832
What did you do?

817
01:09:47,834 --> 01:09:48,876
-Okay, what did you do?
-Hey.

818
01:09:48,961 --> 01:09:50,336
-What did you do to him?
-Easy!

819
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:51,462
He didn't want this.

820
01:09:51,546 --> 01:09:53,923
What did we do? What did he do?
What'd he tell you?

821
01:09:54,007 --> 01:09:55,424
-Both of you calm down.
-Nothing.

822
01:09:55,509 --> 01:09:58,594
He tells me nothing
because he's scared of you.

823
01:10:03,725 --> 01:10:05,643
-Too late now.
- Bella, get back!

824
01:10:06,853 --> 01:10:09,563
Paul, calm down, now!

825
01:10:18,198 --> 01:10:19,448
Bella!

826
01:10:20,701 --> 01:10:21,826
Run!

827
01:10:25,038 --> 01:10:26,372
Jake, run!

828
01:10:52,566 --> 01:10:53,733
Paul!

829
01:11:04,411 --> 01:11:07,079
Hey! Take Bella back to Emily's place.

830
01:11:08,749 --> 01:11:11,167
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

831
01:11:16,173 --> 01:11:20,051
Alice, is it possible that everything
is true?

832
01:11:20,761 --> 01:11:23,137
The fairy tales and horror stories?

833
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:26,766
Is it possible that there isn't anything
sane or normal at all?

834
01:11:28,935 --> 01:11:30,853
Hey, l think we should go back
and see if Jacob's okay.

835
01:11:30,937 --> 01:11:33,564
l hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.

836
01:11:33,648 --> 01:11:35,441
No way. Jacob's a natural.

837
01:11:35,525 --> 01:11:39,236
You see him phase on the fly?
l got five says Paul doesn't touch him.

838
01:11:39,321 --> 01:11:41,781
Come on in, Bella. We won't bite.

839
01:11:42,115 --> 01:11:43,866
Speak for yourself.

840
01:11:45,077 --> 01:11:47,036
l done me wrong

841
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,330
And done all wrong

842
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:53,542
All the wrong I致e done
I知 sure I値l live quite long

843
01:11:53,627 --> 01:11:58,214
Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fianc馥?
Don't stare. It bugs Sam.

844
01:12:00,842 --> 01:12:02,551
Why would l stare?

845
01:12:02,636 --> 01:12:05,721
Are you guys hungry? Like l have to ask.

846
01:12:13,146 --> 01:12:14,730
Who's this?

847
01:12:14,815 --> 01:12:16,649
Bella Swan. Who else?

848
01:12:18,318 --> 01:12:19,360
Hmm.

849
01:12:19,444 --> 01:12:21,695
So, you're the vampire girl.

850
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:26,826
So, you're the wolf girl.

851
01:12:29,663 --> 01:12:31,080
Guess so.

852
01:12:31,164 --> 01:12:33,749
Well, I知 engaged to one.

853
01:12:37,087 --> 01:12:41,632
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first. Muffin?

854
01:12:42,676 --> 01:12:44,135
Sure. Thanks.

855
01:12:44,219 --> 01:12:47,721
Leave it to Jacob to find a way
around Sam's gag order.

856
01:12:48,515 --> 01:12:50,433
He didn't say anything to me.

857
01:12:50,517 --> 01:12:51,684
That's a wolf thing.

858
01:12:51,768 --> 01:12:54,270
Alpha's orders get obeyed
whether we want them to or not.

859
01:12:54,354 --> 01:12:56,605
And check it out.
We can hear each other's thoughts.

860
01:12:56,690 --> 01:13:00,526
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets. Damn it!

861
01:13:00,861 --> 01:13:03,195
This chick runs with vampires.

862
01:13:04,197 --> 01:13:06,782
You can't really run with vampires.

863
01:13:08,743 --> 01:13:10,619
'Cause they're fast.

864
01:13:10,871 --> 01:13:13,622
Yeah? Well, we're faster.

865
01:13:15,041 --> 01:13:16,709
Freaked out yet?

866
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,796
You're not the first monsters I致e met.

867
01:13:20,881 --> 01:13:23,716
Jake's right. You're good with weird.

868
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:26,677
Hey.

869
01:13:46,072 --> 01:13:47,406
Sorry.

870
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,756
So you're a werewolf?

871
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:07,927
Yeah. Last time l checked.

872
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:13,265
A few lucky members
of the tribe have the gene.

873
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:17,436
A bloodsucker moves into town
and the fever sets in.

874
01:14:20,023 --> 01:14:21,106
Mono.

875
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:24,401
Yeah. l wish.

876
01:14:27,656 --> 01:14:31,742
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?

877
01:14:34,287 --> 01:14:36,288
l mean, it's wrong.

878
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,418
It痴 not a lifestyle choice, Bella.

879
01:14:41,836 --> 01:14:44,547
l was born this way. l can't help it.

880
01:14:44,631 --> 01:14:47,800
You're such a hypocrite. What,
I知 not the right kind of monster for you?

881
01:14:47,884 --> 01:14:49,802
It痴 not what you are.

882
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:53,597
It痴 what you do. They never hurt anybody.

883
01:14:56,017 --> 01:14:57,434
You've killed people, Jake.

884
01:14:57,519 --> 01:14:59,937
Bella, we're not killing anyone.

885
01:15:01,982 --> 01:15:03,399
Then who is?

886
01:15:03,483 --> 01:15:06,443
What we're trying
to protect you people from,

887
01:15:06,695 --> 01:15:08,821
the only thing we do kill,

888
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:12,491
vampires.

889
01:15:13,994 --> 01:15:15,077
Wait, Jake, you can't.

890
01:15:15,161 --> 01:15:17,413
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens

891
01:15:17,497 --> 01:15:19,957
unless they violate the treaty.

892
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,668
That's not what I知 saying.

893
01:15:22,961 --> 01:15:25,504
You can't kill vampires. They'll...

894
01:15:26,006 --> 01:15:27,673
They'll kill you.

895
01:15:27,841 --> 01:15:31,260
Really? We took out that leech
with the dreads easy enough.

896
01:15:35,682 --> 01:15:36,807
Laurent?

897
01:15:36,891 --> 01:15:39,560
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.

898
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:41,395
Victoria's here?

899
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:44,481
Was. We chased her all the way
to the Canadian border the other night.

900
01:15:44,566 --> 01:15:47,985
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.

901
01:15:48,069 --> 01:15:49,403
l do.

902
01:15:52,782 --> 01:15:53,907
Me.

903
01:16:03,043 --> 01:16:05,878
Don't worry. We've got this place covered.

904
01:16:06,546 --> 01:16:09,006
She won't get near you or Charlie.

905
01:16:09,549 --> 01:16:11,300
Look, you've got to be careful.

906
01:16:11,384 --> 01:16:14,470
She's fast. You don't know how fast she is.

907
01:16:14,554 --> 01:16:18,432
You know, your lack of confidence in us
is a little insulting.

908
01:16:19,934 --> 01:16:21,810
All right, I壇 better go.

909
01:16:23,188 --> 01:16:24,730
You gotta go?

910
01:16:25,649 --> 01:16:26,815
Yeah.

911
01:16:27,567 --> 01:16:29,693
Got a vampire to kill.

912
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,876
Alice, I知 all right.

913
01:16:47,545 --> 01:16:49,296
Until I知 alone.

914
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:53,050
And lately, that's all the time.

915
01:16:53,468 --> 01:16:56,178
Jacob's gone. He's hunting Victoria.

916
01:16:56,262 --> 01:16:58,514
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.

917
01:16:58,598 --> 01:17:00,265
And you're gone.

918
01:17:01,267 --> 01:17:03,018
And so is Edward.

919
01:17:07,023 --> 01:17:09,400
And there's just nothing now.

920
01:17:12,445 --> 01:17:14,446
You got something, Harry?

921
01:17:15,657 --> 01:17:17,282
Nope. Nothing.

922
01:17:24,958 --> 01:17:26,875
But l realize where l have to go,

923
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,503
what l have to do to see him again.

924
01:17:41,307 --> 01:17:43,851
A tear in my brain

925
01:17:49,315 --> 01:17:52,943
Allows the voices in

926
01:17:59,325 --> 01:18:02,661
They wanna push you off the path

927
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:10,878
With their frequency wires

928
01:18:18,303 --> 01:18:22,014
And you can do no wrong

929
01:18:28,313 --> 01:18:34,860
In my eyes

930
01:18:37,071 --> 01:18:40,574
You can do no wrong

931
01:18:46,831 --> 01:18:53,545
In my eyes

932
01:18:55,507 --> 01:18:57,549
A drunken salesman

933
01:18:57,634 --> 01:18:59,551
Your hearing damage

934
01:18:59,636 --> 01:19:01,512
Your mind is restless

935
01:19:01,596 --> 01:19:03,680
They say you're getting better

936
01:19:03,765 --> 01:19:07,017
But you don't feel any better

937
01:19:14,108 --> 01:19:16,151
Your speakers are blowing

938
01:19:16,236 --> 01:19:18,320
Your ears are wrecking

939
01:19:18,404 --> 01:19:20,322
Your hearing damage

940
01:19:20,406 --> 01:19:24,910
You wish you felt better

941
01:19:33,002 --> 01:19:36,755
You can do no wrong

942
01:19:42,929 --> 01:19:52,938
In my eyes

943
01:20:27,473 --> 01:20:29,016
Don't do this.

944
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:36,106
You wanted me to be human.

945
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:39,943
Watch me.

946
01:20:42,697 --> 01:20:43,989
Please.

947
01:20:45,283 --> 01:20:46,283
For me.

948
01:20:46,367 --> 01:20:49,036
You won't stay with me any other way.

949
01:20:51,748 --> 01:20:53,665
Bella, please.

950
01:21:56,145 --> 01:22:02,567
This constant noise all the time

951
01:22:13,037 --> 01:22:18,917
Even though you're the only one l see

952
01:22:21,879 --> 01:22:23,130
Breathe!

953
01:22:24,882 --> 01:22:25,924
Breathe!

954
01:22:27,593 --> 01:22:29,636
Come on, Bella, breathe!

955
01:22:36,728 --> 01:22:39,354
Bella? Bella, can you hear me?

956
01:22:45,695 --> 01:22:47,070
Jake?

957
01:22:48,489 --> 01:22:49,906
Come here.

958
01:22:55,288 --> 01:22:57,664
What the hell were you thinking?

959
01:22:58,791 --> 01:23:01,001
l just wanted to see something.

960
01:23:01,461 --> 01:23:05,172
Get her home!
I知 gonna go help out over at Harry's place.

961
01:23:08,176 --> 01:23:10,218
What happened at Harry's?

962
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:13,138
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.

963
01:23:13,806 --> 01:23:16,391
Charlie and my dad
are over at his place with his family.

964
01:23:16,476 --> 01:23:17,976
Is he okay?

965
01:23:20,146 --> 01:23:21,480
He's gone.

966
01:23:25,193 --> 01:23:28,737
Come on. I値l get you something dry
and drive you home.

967
01:23:39,916 --> 01:23:42,501
1 08 degrees over here.

968
01:23:44,378 --> 01:23:45,587
God!

969
01:23:46,714 --> 01:23:48,673
My hands are freezing.

970
01:23:50,802 --> 01:23:53,345
It must be nice, never getting cold.

971
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:55,388
It痴 a wolf thing.

972
01:23:56,182 --> 01:23:57,516
It痴 not.

973
01:23:58,184 --> 01:24:00,018
It痴 a Jacob thing.

974
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,354
You're just warm.

975
01:24:04,732 --> 01:24:06,691
You're like your own sun.

976
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:13,990
This is better, now that you know about me.

977
01:24:17,328 --> 01:24:18,537
But...

978
01:24:23,835 --> 01:24:26,211
You saw what happened to Emily.

979
01:24:29,549 --> 01:24:31,133
Sam got angry.

980
01:24:32,051 --> 01:24:34,261
Lost it for a split second.

981
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,764
Em was standing too close.

982
01:24:40,184 --> 01:24:42,894
He'll never be able to take that back.

983
01:24:45,523 --> 01:24:47,566
What if l got mad at you?

984
01:24:58,995 --> 01:25:00,453
Sometimes,

985
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,584
l feel like I知 gonna disappear.

986
01:25:12,175 --> 01:25:14,426
Okay, not that you need me

987
01:25:15,094 --> 01:25:17,429
to tell you something like this,

988
01:25:19,056 --> 01:25:22,642
but l always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.

989
01:25:25,563 --> 01:25:27,731
l wouldn't let that happen.

990
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,234
How?

991
01:25:34,697 --> 01:25:36,990
I値l tell you all the time

992
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:42,621
how special you are.

993
01:26:02,099 --> 01:26:04,309
Thank you. For everything.

994
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:12,525
Wait.

995
01:26:15,321 --> 01:26:17,030
There's a vampire.

996
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:19,199
How do you know?

997
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:22,494
l can smell it. I知 getting you out of here.

998
01:26:23,329 --> 01:26:24,871
That's Carlisle's car.

999
01:26:26,415 --> 01:26:27,916
They're here.

1000
01:26:28,292 --> 01:26:31,836
Bella, it's a trick! Stop!
You gotta come with me!

1001
01:26:35,383 --> 01:26:37,008
They won't hurt me.

1002
01:26:37,093 --> 01:26:40,512
lf a Cullen is back here,
this is their territory.

1003
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:43,348
Treaty says we can only defend
on our own lands.

1004
01:26:43,432 --> 01:26:47,519
-l can't protect you here.
-Okay. That's okay. You don't have to.

1005
01:26:50,022 --> 01:26:51,773
You're about to cross a line.

1006
01:26:51,857 --> 01:26:53,775
Then don't draw one.

1007
01:26:54,068 --> 01:26:55,360
Please?

1008
01:27:12,253 --> 01:27:13,461
Alice?

1009
01:27:13,754 --> 01:27:16,339
-Oh, my God! What are you...
-Bella!

1010
01:27:16,966 --> 01:27:21,136
I知 sorry, l just,
l can't believe you're here. Is...

1011
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:24,556
Would you like to explain to me
how you're alive?

1012
01:27:25,266 --> 01:27:26,308
What?

1013
01:27:26,392 --> 01:27:29,561
l saw a vision of you. You jumped off a cliff.

1014
01:27:30,521 --> 01:27:32,647
Why in the hell
would you try and kill yourself?

1015
01:27:32,732 --> 01:27:33,857
l mean, what about Charlie?

1016
01:27:33,941 --> 01:27:36,693
-What about...
-l didn't try to kill myself.

1017
01:27:36,777 --> 01:27:38,236
I was cliff jumping.

1018
01:27:38,321 --> 01:27:40,071
Recreationally.

1019
01:27:40,156 --> 01:27:41,573
It was fun.

1020
01:27:43,784 --> 01:27:47,787
l have never met anyone
more prone to life-threatening idiocy.

1021
01:27:53,294 --> 01:27:54,419
Does...

1022
01:27:54,962 --> 01:27:57,005
Did you tell him?

1023
01:27:57,089 --> 01:27:58,173
No.

1024
01:27:59,842 --> 01:28:02,594
He only calls in once every few months.

1025
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:06,431
He said he wants to be alone.

1026
01:28:12,271 --> 01:28:15,648
Bella, what is that
God-awful wet dog smell?

1027
01:28:17,109 --> 01:28:18,109
Um...

1028
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:20,695
That's probably me.

1029
01:28:21,697 --> 01:28:23,948
Or it's Jacob.

1030
01:28:25,201 --> 01:28:26,618
Jacob who?

1031
01:28:27,953 --> 01:28:30,080
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.

1032
01:28:31,665 --> 01:28:34,793
Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.

1033
01:28:36,087 --> 01:28:37,962
Speak for yourself.

1034
01:28:42,802 --> 01:28:44,969
l had to see you were safe.

1035
01:28:46,514 --> 01:28:49,307
l thought you couldn't protect me here.

1036
01:28:49,558 --> 01:28:51,309
Guess l don't care.

1037
01:28:55,022 --> 01:28:57,315
Well, I知 not gonna hurt her.

1038
01:28:58,901 --> 01:29:00,819
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.

1039
01:29:00,903 --> 01:29:04,322
I知 talking about the other bloodsucker
who tried to kill Bella because of you.

1040
01:29:04,407 --> 01:29:05,448
Victoria?

1041
01:29:05,533 --> 01:29:07,659
Yeah, Victoria's been around.

1042
01:29:07,743 --> 01:29:09,494
l didn't see her.

1043
01:29:09,995 --> 01:29:13,540
l didn't see you
get pulled out of the water, either.

1044
01:29:14,458 --> 01:29:17,419
l can't see past you and your pack of mutts.

1045
01:29:17,503 --> 01:29:19,629
Don't get me upset...

1046
01:29:19,713 --> 01:29:23,883
-Hey, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
-...or things are gonna get very ugly.

1047
01:29:29,265 --> 01:29:31,182
I値l give you a minute.

1048
01:29:37,189 --> 01:29:38,273
Hey.

1049
01:29:39,358 --> 01:29:41,943
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back,

1050
01:29:42,027 --> 01:29:44,821
-right?
-As soon as you put the dog out.

1051
01:29:53,831 --> 01:29:55,206
Is he...

1052
01:29:59,336 --> 01:30:00,879
Are there others?
How many Cullens are here

1053
01:30:00,963 --> 01:30:03,131
and how long are they staying?

1054
01:30:03,215 --> 01:30:04,340
No.

1055
01:30:05,217 --> 01:30:06,968
It痴 just Alice.

1056
01:30:11,599 --> 01:30:14,392
And she can stay as long as she'd like.

1057
01:30:16,854 --> 01:30:19,189
Well, are the rest coming back?

1058
01:30:25,488 --> 01:30:26,571
No.

1059
01:30:28,407 --> 01:30:29,824
Not that l know of.

1060
01:30:31,035 --> 01:30:32,577
Anything else?

1061
01:30:36,874 --> 01:30:38,249
That's it.

1062
01:30:40,419 --> 01:30:44,088
Well, if that's all,
then you'd better go run back to Sam.

1063
01:30:47,176 --> 01:30:48,968
I致e done it again.

1064
01:30:49,929 --> 01:30:52,096
l keep breaking my promise.

1065
01:30:57,353 --> 01:31:00,104
We don't have to do this to each other.

1066
01:31:04,568 --> 01:31:06,110
Yes, we do.

1067
01:31:17,957 --> 01:31:19,290
Bella...

1068
01:31:42,189 --> 01:31:43,815
Swan residence.

1069
01:31:49,572 --> 01:31:51,656
He's not here right now.

1070
01:31:52,366 --> 01:31:54,284
He's arranging a funeral.

1071
01:32:10,217 --> 01:32:11,843
Who was that?

1072
01:32:12,136 --> 01:32:13,177
What?

1073
01:32:13,262 --> 01:32:15,054
Always in the way.

1074
01:32:17,224 --> 01:32:18,433
Who was that?

1075
01:32:18,517 --> 01:32:20,143
Bella, step back.

1076
01:32:20,227 --> 01:32:23,438
-Jake, who was that?
-Bella! Bella, it's Edward.

1077
01:32:24,023 --> 01:32:27,442
He thinks you're dead.
Rosalie told him why l came here.

1078
01:32:29,653 --> 01:32:32,363
Why would you...
Why didn't you let me speak to him?

1079
01:32:32,448 --> 01:32:33,615
-He didn't ask for you.
-Bella.

1080
01:32:33,699 --> 01:32:37,285
-l don't care!
-Bella. Bella! He's going to the Volturi.

1081
01:32:37,953 --> 01:32:39,871
He wants to die, too.

1082
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:44,917
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore. Remember?

1083
01:32:45,002 --> 01:32:48,463
No, I知 not gonna let him kill himself
out of guilt.

1084
01:32:49,173 --> 01:32:51,007
What about your dad?

1085
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:54,927
I知 1 8.
I知 legally free to go, and l left a note.

1086
01:32:56,722 --> 01:32:58,431
Please, Bella,

1087
01:32:59,892 --> 01:33:01,976
just stay here.

1088
01:33:03,729 --> 01:33:05,229
For Charlie.

1089
01:33:08,067 --> 01:33:09,609
Or for me.

1090
01:33:10,653 --> 01:33:12,195
l have to go.

1091
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:19,911
I知 begging you.

1092
01:33:22,581 --> 01:33:23,956
Please.

1093
01:33:25,709 --> 01:33:27,335
Goodbye, Jacob.

1094
01:33:35,844 --> 01:33:37,053
Okay.

1095
01:33:45,187 --> 01:33:47,480
)

1096
01:34:38,490 --> 01:34:40,825
So you've made up your minds.

1097
01:34:41,076 --> 01:34:43,536
I知 afraid your particular gifts

1098
01:34:44,663 --> 01:34:46,998
are too valuable to destroy.

1099
01:34:47,958 --> 01:34:52,837
But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us.

1100
01:34:53,964 --> 01:34:57,675
We would be delighted to utilize
your skills.

1101
01:34:58,635 --> 01:35:01,179
Won't you consider staying with us?

1102
01:35:02,973 --> 01:35:05,308
You know it will happen anyway.

1103
01:35:05,392 --> 01:35:07,310
Not without cause.

1104
01:35:11,565 --> 01:35:13,149
Such a waste.

1105
01:35:20,365 --> 01:35:22,158
I知 guessing you didn't rent this car?

1106
01:35:22,242 --> 01:35:24,285
l figured you wouldn't be opposed
to grand theft auto.

1107
01:35:24,369 --> 01:35:25,745
Not today.

1108
01:35:29,082 --> 01:35:30,750
What? What do you see?

1109
01:35:30,834 --> 01:35:32,710
They refused him.

1110
01:35:32,795 --> 01:35:35,213
-So?
-He's gonna make a scene.

1111
01:35:35,547 --> 01:35:38,382
-Show himself to the humans.
-No! When?

1112
01:35:39,426 --> 01:35:42,470
He's gonna wait until noon,
when the sun's at its highest.

1113
01:35:45,224 --> 01:35:46,432
God, Alice, you got to hurry up.

1114
01:35:46,517 --> 01:35:48,392
There's Volterra.

1115
01:36:13,168 --> 01:36:16,003
-Why are they all in red?
-San Marco's Day festival.

1116
01:36:16,088 --> 01:36:18,881
They're commemorating
the expulsion of vampires from the city.

1117
01:36:18,966 --> 01:36:20,299
It痴 the perfect setting.

1118
01:36:20,384 --> 01:36:22,927
The Volturi will never let him get far enough
to reveal himself.

1119
01:36:23,011 --> 01:36:24,720
We have five minutes.

1120
01:36:24,805 --> 01:36:27,098
l know, Bella, just breathe.

1121
01:36:33,188 --> 01:36:34,188
Alice!

1122
01:36:34,273 --> 01:36:36,440
Bella, you're the only one
he can't see coming.

1123
01:36:36,525 --> 01:36:39,610
lf l go, he'll read my thoughts.
He'll think I知 lying. He'll rush into it.

1124
01:36:40,362 --> 01:36:43,698
-Where do l go?
-He'll be under the clock tower. Go!

1125
01:38:36,144 --> 01:38:37,478
Don't!

1126
01:38:39,564 --> 01:38:40,690
Heaven.

1127
01:38:40,774 --> 01:38:42,441
You have to move.

1128
01:38:43,276 --> 01:38:46,070
Open your eyes. Look at me. I知 alive.

1129
01:38:46,822 --> 01:38:48,572
You have to move.

1130
01:38:49,408 --> 01:38:50,658
Bella.

1131
01:38:58,125 --> 01:39:00,251
-You're here.
-I知 here.

1132
01:39:03,088 --> 01:39:04,296
You're alive.

1133
01:39:07,759 --> 01:39:08,968
Yes.

1134
01:39:18,437 --> 01:39:21,022
l needed to make you see me once.

1135
01:39:22,065 --> 01:39:23,357
You had to know that l was alive,

1136
01:39:23,442 --> 01:39:26,569
that you didn't have
to feel guilty about anything.

1137
01:39:29,448 --> 01:39:32,033
l can let you go now.

1138
01:39:36,788 --> 01:39:38,956
l never acted out of guilt.

1139
01:39:41,418 --> 01:39:44,920
l just couldn't live in a world
where you don't exist.

1140
01:39:46,298 --> 01:39:48,340
-But you said...
-l lied.

1141
01:39:49,051 --> 01:39:52,136
l had to lie. But you believed me so easily.

1142
01:39:57,809 --> 01:40:01,395
Because it doesn't make sense
for you to love me.

1143
01:40:04,107 --> 01:40:07,693
l mean, I知 nothing. I知 human. I知 nothing.

1144
01:40:08,904 --> 01:40:12,490
Bella, you're everything to me.

1145
01:40:14,451 --> 01:40:16,160
You're everything.

1146
01:40:41,853 --> 01:40:43,938
l won't be needing your services after all,
gentlemen.

1147
01:40:44,022 --> 01:40:46,107
Aro wants to speak with you again.

1148
01:40:46,191 --> 01:40:47,441
No rules were broken.

1149
01:40:47,526 --> 01:40:51,695
Nonetheless, we should take this
conversation to a more appropriate venue.

1150
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:53,030
Fine.

1151
01:40:54,366 --> 01:40:56,700
Bella, why don't you go
and enjoy the rest of the festival?

1152
01:40:56,785 --> 01:40:58,119
The girl comes with us.

1153
01:40:58,203 --> 01:40:59,912
No. You can go to hell.

1154
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:03,874
Come on, guys.

1155
01:41:04,126 --> 01:41:07,545
It痴 a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.

1156
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:09,797
We wouldn't.

1157
01:41:10,173 --> 01:41:11,507
Enough.

1158
01:41:13,051 --> 01:41:14,218
Jane.

1159
01:41:15,011 --> 01:41:18,013
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.

1160
01:41:26,064 --> 01:41:28,023
Just do as she says.

1161
01:41:40,579 --> 01:41:41,954
Go ahead.

1162
01:41:45,959 --> 01:41:47,626
Don't be scared.

1163
01:41:48,587 --> 01:41:49,920
Are you?

1164
01:41:50,881 --> 01:41:51,964
No.

1165
01:42:30,545 --> 01:42:32,671
-Is she human?
-Yes.

1166
01:42:35,842 --> 01:42:37,468
Does she know?

1167
01:42:37,969 --> 01:42:39,136
Yes.

1168
01:42:39,471 --> 01:42:41,263
Then, why would...

1169
01:42:42,891 --> 01:42:44,683
She wants to be.

1170
01:42:45,143 --> 01:42:46,560
And so she will be.

1171
01:42:46,645 --> 01:42:48,062
Or dessert.

1172
01:42:56,571 --> 01:43:00,366
Sister. They send you out to get one
and you bring back two.

1173
01:43:01,117 --> 01:43:02,576
And a half.

1174
01:43:03,745 --> 01:43:05,120
Such a clever girl.

1175
01:43:05,205 --> 01:43:07,122
What a happy surprise!

1176
01:43:08,166 --> 01:43:10,834
Bella is alive after all.

1177
01:43:11,711 --> 01:43:14,380
Isn't that wonderful?

1178
01:43:15,507 --> 01:43:17,383
l love a happy ending.

1179
01:43:18,510 --> 01:43:19,468
Ah.

1180
01:43:21,846 --> 01:43:23,681
They are so rare.

1181
01:43:30,522 --> 01:43:33,023
Her blood appeals to you so much

1182
01:43:34,317 --> 01:43:36,151
it makes me thirsty.

1183
01:43:36,403 --> 01:43:39,196
How can you stand to be so close to her?

1184
01:43:39,364 --> 01:43:42,366
-It痴 not without difficulty.
-Yes, l can see that.

1185
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:43,659
)

1186
01:43:45,787 --> 01:43:49,373
Aro can read every thought
I致e ever had with one touch.

1187
01:43:50,375 --> 01:43:52,584
And now you know everything.

1188
01:43:53,211 --> 01:43:55,004
So get on with it.

1189
01:43:58,133 --> 01:44:01,343
You are quite a soul reader yourself,
Edward.

1190
01:44:02,971 --> 01:44:07,224
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.

1191
01:44:10,645 --> 01:44:12,104
Fascinating.

1192
01:44:15,650 --> 01:44:21,030
l would love to see
if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.

1193
01:44:23,742 --> 01:44:25,909
Would you do me the honor?

1194
01:44:46,765 --> 01:44:48,182
Interesting.

1195
01:44:48,558 --> 01:44:49,558
Hmm.

1196
01:44:50,352 --> 01:44:51,935
l see nothing.

1197
01:45:01,279 --> 01:45:02,821
l wonder if...

1198
01:45:03,656 --> 01:45:06,617
Let us see if she's immune
to all our powers.

1199
01:45:08,203 --> 01:45:09,661
Shall we, Jane?

1200
01:45:11,539 --> 01:45:13,290
-No!
-Pain.

1201
01:45:29,307 --> 01:45:30,641
Stop!

1202
01:45:31,476 --> 01:45:33,227
Stop! Please! Stop!

1203
01:45:33,311 --> 01:45:37,147
Stop! Just stop hurting him!
Please! Please!

1204
01:45:38,858 --> 01:45:40,109
Jane?

1205
01:45:42,195 --> 01:45:43,195
Master?

1206
01:45:47,784 --> 01:45:49,493
Go ahead, my dear.

1207
01:45:54,999 --> 01:45:57,209
This may hurt just a little.

1208
01:46:13,351 --> 01:46:14,852
Remarkable!

1209
01:46:17,063 --> 01:46:19,314
She confounds us all.

1210
01:46:20,358 --> 01:46:23,527
So what do we do with you now?

1211
01:46:24,070 --> 01:46:27,197
You already know
what you're going to do, Aro.

1212
01:46:28,199 --> 01:46:30,033
She knows too much.

1213
01:46:30,577 --> 01:46:32,369
She's a liability.

1214
01:46:33,705 --> 01:46:34,705
Hmm.

1215
01:46:36,332 --> 01:46:37,875
That's true.

1216
01:46:41,754 --> 01:46:43,046
Felix?

1217
01:46:46,926 --> 01:46:48,010
No!

1218
01:47:49,572 --> 01:47:52,658
Please! No! No! Please, please!

1219
01:47:55,537 --> 01:47:58,664
Kill me! Kill me! Not him.

1220
01:48:09,676 --> 01:48:12,219
How extraordinary.

1221
01:48:13,930 --> 01:48:18,350
You would give up your life
for someone like us.

1222
01:48:19,477 --> 01:48:20,811
A vampire.

1223
01:48:22,230 --> 01:48:24,648
A soulless monster.

1224
01:48:24,732 --> 01:48:26,733
Just get away from her!

1225
01:48:30,822 --> 01:48:35,284
You don't know a thing about his soul.

1226
01:48:46,879 --> 01:48:48,589
This is a sadness.

1227
01:48:50,717 --> 01:48:54,303
lf only it were your intention
to give her immortality.

1228
01:49:03,187 --> 01:49:04,479
Wait!

1229
01:49:06,107 --> 01:49:08,191
Bella will be one of us.

1230
01:49:09,902 --> 01:49:11,403
I致e seen it.

1231
01:49:13,197 --> 01:49:15,115
I値l change her myself.

1232
01:49:49,025 --> 01:49:50,525
Mesmerizing.

1233
01:49:50,943 --> 01:49:55,364
To see what you have seen
before it has happened.

1234
01:49:58,284 --> 01:50:02,746
Your gifts will make for an intriguing

1235
01:50:03,998 --> 01:50:05,415
immortal,

1236
01:50:06,501 --> 01:50:08,043
Isabella.

1237
01:50:12,924 --> 01:50:14,341
Go now.

1238
01:50:15,051 --> 01:50:17,010
Make your preparations.

1239
01:50:17,804 --> 01:50:19,805
Let us be done with this.

1240
01:50:21,641 --> 01:50:23,934
Heidi will arrive any moment.

1241
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:29,189
Thank you for your visit.

1242
01:50:29,273 --> 01:50:30,816
We will return the favor.

1243
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:33,860
l would advise that you follow through
on your promise soon.

1244
01:50:33,945 --> 01:50:36,279
We do not offer second chances.

1245
01:50:37,949 --> 01:50:41,034
Goodbye, my young friends.

1246
01:50:47,417 --> 01:50:49,209
Nice fishing, Heidi.

1247
01:50:49,293 --> 01:50:51,545
Yes, they do look rather juicy.

1248
01:50:51,629 --> 01:50:53,338
Save some for me.

1249
01:50:54,298 --> 01:50:57,134
This way, please. Stay together.

1250
01:51:11,774 --> 01:51:13,316
Stop! Stop!

1251
01:51:24,162 --> 01:51:25,704
You're here.

1252
01:51:27,749 --> 01:51:29,332
You can sleep.

1253
01:51:33,129 --> 01:51:35,756
I値l still be here when you wake up.

1254
01:51:39,343 --> 01:51:42,387
Bella, the only reason l left

1255
01:51:44,182 --> 01:51:47,100
was because l thought
l was protecting you.

1256
01:51:48,978 --> 01:51:50,604
l needed you

1257
01:51:50,688 --> 01:51:54,649
to have a chance at a normal, happy life.

1258
01:51:58,738 --> 01:52:01,114
It was so easy for you to leave.

1259
01:52:03,701 --> 01:52:07,370
Leaving you was the hardest thing
I致e done in 1 00 years.

1260
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:15,712
And l swear,

1261
01:52:17,048 --> 01:52:19,716
l will never fail you again.

1262
01:52:22,011 --> 01:52:23,553
I知 so sorry.

1263
01:52:25,973 --> 01:52:27,891
-Charlie's coming.
-Hey.

1264
01:52:31,062 --> 01:52:32,437
You okay?

1265
01:52:33,856 --> 01:52:35,106
I知 fine.

1266
01:52:38,236 --> 01:52:40,403
Dad, you don't have to worry.

1267
01:52:40,905 --> 01:52:42,906
You know, last time you said that,
you took off.

1268
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:45,158
l didn't see you for three days.

1269
01:52:46,869 --> 01:52:48,745
I知 really sorry, Dad.

1270
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:54,251
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.

1271
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:58,171
Ever.

1272
01:53:00,967 --> 01:53:02,551
And you're grounded

1273
01:53:03,010 --> 01:53:05,136
for the rest of your life.

1274
01:53:06,305 --> 01:53:07,472
Okay.

1275
01:53:17,775 --> 01:53:20,569
I知 not technically
breaking any of his rules.

1276
01:53:23,573 --> 01:53:26,783
He did say
l couldn't take a step inside the door.

1277
01:53:27,285 --> 01:53:29,578
l came in through the window.

1278
01:53:33,207 --> 01:53:35,709
He's not gonna forgive me easily.

1279
01:53:38,170 --> 01:53:39,462
l know.

1280
01:53:41,507 --> 01:53:42,883
Can you?

1281
01:53:46,637 --> 01:53:48,221
l hope you can,

1282
01:53:49,015 --> 01:53:52,225
'cause l honestly don't know
how to live without you.

1283
01:53:56,564 --> 01:53:57,981
Come here.

1284
01:54:15,625 --> 01:54:18,585
Once Alice changes me,

1285
01:54:21,505 --> 01:54:23,673
you can't get rid of me.

1286
01:54:24,884 --> 01:54:27,177
She won't need to change you.

1287
01:54:27,803 --> 01:54:31,306
There are always ways
to keep the Volturi in the dark.

1288
01:54:33,017 --> 01:54:35,393
No. No.

1289
01:54:42,193 --> 01:54:44,194
You all know what l want.

1290
01:54:46,364 --> 01:54:49,366
And l know how much I知 asking for.

1291
01:54:51,619 --> 01:54:55,121
The only thing that l can think of
for it to be fair is to just vote.

1292
01:54:55,206 --> 01:54:58,541
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-Shut up.

1293
01:55:00,169 --> 01:55:01,378
Alice?

1294
01:55:01,837 --> 01:55:04,381
l already consider you my sister.

1295
01:55:08,177 --> 01:55:09,803
-Yes.
-Thank you.

1296
01:55:09,887 --> 01:55:11,388
l vote "yes."

1297
01:55:12,807 --> 01:55:16,309
It would be nice to not
want to kill you all the time.

1298
01:55:18,187 --> 01:55:19,187
Hmm.

1299
01:55:19,313 --> 01:55:20,647
I知 sorry.

1300
01:55:22,566 --> 01:55:25,694
I知 really sorry to both of you
for how I've acted,

1301
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:28,363
and I知 really grateful
that you were brave enough

1302
01:55:28,447 --> 01:55:30,573
to go and save my brother.

1303
01:55:32,076 --> 01:55:35,537
But this isn't a life
l would have chosen for myself.

1304
01:55:38,082 --> 01:55:41,751
And l wish that there'd been someone
to vote "no" for me.

1305
01:55:44,630 --> 01:55:46,047
So, no.

1306
01:55:47,466 --> 01:55:49,384
I vote "Hell, yeah."

1307
01:55:51,262 --> 01:55:53,638
And we can pick a fight
with these Volturi some other way.

1308
01:55:53,723 --> 01:55:56,683
I already consider you a part of the family.

1309
01:55:57,309 --> 01:55:58,560
Yes.

1310
01:56:04,442 --> 01:56:06,651
Why are you doing this to me?

1311
01:56:08,362 --> 01:56:09,696
You know what this means.

1312
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:13,658
You've chosen not to live without her,
which leaves me no choice.

1313
01:56:14,410 --> 01:56:16,286
I won't lose my son.

1314
01:56:22,501 --> 01:56:26,546
I値l wait until after graduation
to make it easier on Charlie.

1315
01:56:31,552 --> 01:56:34,471
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.

1316
01:56:41,479 --> 01:56:43,563
He wants to talk to me.

1317
01:56:46,692 --> 01:56:48,318
So you're still alive for now.

1318
01:56:48,402 --> 01:56:50,862
He thinks it's me keeping
you away.

1319
01:56:50,946 --> 01:56:53,448
You stay the hell out of my head.

1320
01:56:54,533 --> 01:56:58,036
Jacob, I know you have something
to say to me.

1321
01:57:00,372 --> 01:57:04,292
But l want to say something to you first,
if that's all right.

1322
01:57:05,419 --> 01:57:06,836
Thank you.

1323
01:57:09,965 --> 01:57:13,343
Thank you for keeping Bella alive
when I didn't.

1324
01:57:13,886 --> 01:57:16,012
No. You didn't.

1325
01:57:18,015 --> 01:57:20,642
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.

1326
01:57:20,726 --> 01:57:22,602
I知 still grateful.

1327
01:57:23,187 --> 01:57:24,395
But I知 here now.

1328
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:27,190
I知 not gonna leave her side
until she orders me away.

1329
01:57:27,274 --> 01:57:28,608
We'll see.

1330
01:57:31,487 --> 01:57:33,655
Hey, my turn to talk.

1331
01:57:38,202 --> 01:57:41,746
I知 here to remind you
about a key point in the treaty.

1332
01:57:41,914 --> 01:57:43,790
I haven't forgotten.

1333
01:57:43,874 --> 01:57:45,416
What key point?

1334
01:57:45,668 --> 01:57:47,961
lf any of them bites a human,

1335
01:57:48,712 --> 01:57:50,505
the truce is over.

1336
01:57:51,882 --> 01:57:53,716
But if I choose it,
it has nothing to do with you.

1337
01:57:53,801 --> 01:57:55,844
No. No, I won't let you.

1338
01:57:57,429 --> 01:57:59,848
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.

1339
01:57:59,932 --> 01:58:01,850
It痴 not up to you.

1340
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:04,894
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.

1341
01:58:04,979 --> 01:58:06,646
Bella, please, come.

1342
01:58:06,730 --> 01:58:07,897
Wait.

1343
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:12,485
Is he gonna hurt me? Read his mind.

1344
01:58:19,827 --> 01:58:21,161
Jake,

1345
01:58:27,585 --> 01:58:29,210
I love you.

1346
01:58:33,924 --> 01:58:35,592
So, please,

1347
01:58:40,139 --> 01:58:42,223
don't make me choose,

1348
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:49,939
'cause it'll be him.

1349
01:58:53,277 --> 01:58:55,153
It痴 always been him.

1350
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:03,953
Bella...

1351
01:59:11,754 --> 01:59:14,881
-Goodbye, Jacob.
-No, you don't speak for her!

1352
01:59:19,637 --> 01:59:21,638
Bella, get out of here.

1353
01:59:23,432 --> 01:59:24,807
Stop!

1354
01:59:26,977 --> 01:59:28,269
Stop!

1355
01:59:28,354 --> 01:59:31,439
You can't hurt each other
without hurting me.

1356
01:59:50,459 --> 01:59:51,584
Jake.

1357
02:00:06,642 --> 02:00:08,059
He's right.

1358
02:00:09,186 --> 02:00:11,646
You shouldn't become what l am.

1359
02:00:16,527 --> 02:00:18,528
I can't do this alone.

1360
02:00:21,198 --> 02:00:23,157
Then, please, just wait.

1361
02:00:30,165 --> 02:00:32,792
Just give me five years.

1362
02:00:38,382 --> 02:00:40,049
That's too long.

1363
02:00:44,513 --> 02:00:45,972
Then three?

1364
02:00:50,686 --> 02:00:52,478
You're so stubborn.

1365
02:00:54,356 --> 02:00:56,441
What are you waiting for?

1366
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:08,244
l have one condition

1367
02:01:10,748 --> 02:01:13,207
if you want me to do it myself.

1368
02:01:17,338 --> 02:01:19,172
What's the condition?

1369
02:01:19,757 --> 02:01:21,466
And then forever.

1370
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:25,136
That's what I知 asking.

1371
02:01:36,482 --> 02:01:38,149
Marry me, Bella.

1372
02:04:12,721 --> 02:04:16,599
White demon love song down the hall

1373
02:04:18,268 --> 02:04:22,605
White demon shadow on the road

1374
02:04:23,815 --> 02:04:27,944
Back up your mind, there is a call

1375
02:04:29,321 --> 02:04:33,032
He isn't coming after all

1376
02:04:33,116 --> 02:04:35,326
Love this time

1377
02:04:35,410 --> 02:04:39,580
She likes the way he sings

1378
02:04:40,415 --> 02:04:44,377
White demon love song's in her dreams

1379
02:04:48,632 --> 02:04:52,843
White demon, where's your selfish kiss?

1380
02:04:54,137 --> 02:04:58,516
White demon sorrow will arrange

1381
02:04:59,685 --> 02:05:03,854
Let's not forget about the fear

1382
02:05:05,148 --> 02:05:10,570
Black invitation to this place
that cannot change

1383
02:05:10,654 --> 02:05:15,866
While strangely holy

1384
02:05:16,118 --> 02:05:19,328
Come for a rain

1385
02:05:24,835 --> 02:05:29,880
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1386
02:05:30,340 --> 02:05:35,761
White demon, who let your friend go?

1387
02:05:35,846 --> 02:05:40,725
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1388
02:05:41,351 --> 02:05:48,149
White demon, who let your friend go?

1389
02:05:51,028 --> 02:05:56,449
-Let us be in love
-Let us be in love

1390
02:05:56,533 --> 02:06:01,954
-Let's do old and gray
-Let's do old and gray

1391
02:06:02,039 --> 02:06:07,460
-I won't make you cry
-I won't make you cry

1392
02:06:07,544 --> 02:06:12,965
-I will never stray
-I will never stray

1393
02:06:13,050 --> 02:06:18,512
-I will do my part
-I will do my part

1394
02:06:18,597 --> 02:06:24,143
Let us be in love tonight

1395
02:06:24,227 --> 02:06:29,482
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1396
02:06:29,566 --> 02:06:34,737
White demon, who let your friend go?

1397
02:06:35,155 --> 02:06:40,242
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1398
02:06:40,702 --> 02:06:47,333
White demon, who let your friend go?

1399
02:07:03,392 --> 02:07:07,603
Stand it anymore, darling

1400
02:07:08,772 --> 02:07:10,106
Stand it

1401
02:07:19,116 --> 02:07:23,035
Meet me on the equinox

1402
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:25,871
Meet me halfway

1403
02:07:25,956 --> 02:07:29,250
When the sun is perched at its highest peak

1404
02:07:29,334 --> 02:07:33,087
In the middle of the day

1405
02:07:33,171 --> 02:07:36,590
Let me give my love to you

1406
02:07:37,134 --> 02:07:39,844
Let me take your hand

1407
02:07:40,303 --> 02:07:43,723
As we walk in the dimming light

1408
02:07:43,807 --> 02:07:46,976
Oh, darling, understand

1409
02:07:47,394 --> 02:08:00,030
That everything, everything ends

1410
02:08:05,328 --> 02:08:09,039
Meet me on your best behavior

1411
02:08:09,124 --> 02:08:12,001
Meet me at your worst

1412
02:08:12,085 --> 02:08:15,629
For there will be no stone unturned

1413
02:08:15,714 --> 02:08:18,674
Or bubble left to burst

1414
02:08:19,342 --> 02:08:22,928
Let me lay beside you, darling

1415
02:08:23,430 --> 02:08:26,432
Let me be your man

1416
02:08:26,516 --> 02:08:29,935
And let our bodies intertwine

1417
02:08:30,020 --> 02:08:33,522
But always understand

1418
02:08:33,607 --> 02:08:46,368
That everything, everything ends

1419
02:08:47,662 --> 02:08:54,376
That everything, everything, everything ends

1420
02:08:58,298 --> 02:09:00,883
A window

1421
02:09:01,843 --> 02:09:05,554
An opened tomb

1422
02:09:05,639 --> 02:09:08,390
The sun crawls

1423
02:09:08,475 --> 02:09:12,102
Across your bedroom

1424
02:09:12,562 --> 02:09:14,730
A halo

1425
02:09:16,066 --> 02:09:19,610
A waiting room

1426
02:09:19,694 --> 02:09:22,613
Your last breaths

1427
02:09:22,697 --> 02:09:25,282
Moving through you

1428
02:09:25,367 --> 02:09:30,621
As everything, everything ends

1429
02:09:32,207 --> 02:09:37,795
As everything, everything, everything

1430
02:09:37,879 --> 02:09:44,301
Everything, everything, everything ends

1431
02:09:50,141 --> 02:09:53,936
Meet me on the equinox

1432
02:09:54,312 --> 02:09:56,897
Meet me halfway

1433
02:09:56,982 --> 02:10:00,442
When the sun is perched at its highest peak

1434
02:10:00,527 --> 02:10:03,779
In the middle of the day

1435
02:10:04,322 --> 02:10:08,242
Let me give my love to you

1436
02:10:08,326 --> 02:10:10,870
Let me take your hand

1437
02:10:11,454 --> 02:10:14,707
And as we walk in the dimming light

1438
02:10:14,791 --> 02:10:17,960
Oh, darling, understand

1439
02:10:18,128 --> 02:10:22,128
That everything, everything ends
