00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:43,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Dmitri,
every search for a hero...</font>

2
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">must begin with something
that every hero requires...</font>

3
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a villain.</font>

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Therefore, in the search
for our hero, Bellerophon,</font>

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We created a monster,</font>

6
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chimera.</font>

7
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I beg you, Dmitri,
come to Sydney...</font>

8
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and accompany me
to Atlanta immediately.</font>

9
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However we travel,
I must arrive at my destination...</font>

10
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">within 20 hours of departure.</font>

11
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ring around the rosies</font>

12
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A pocket full of posies</font>

13
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ashes, ashes</font>

14
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They all fall down</font>

15
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Folks, we're 2-and-a-half
hours from Atlanta.</font>

16
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look out your window now. We have a
great view of the Rocky Mountains.</font>

17
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You keep staring at that watch as if
your life depended on it, Doctor.</font>

18
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes.</font>

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suppose I'm a bit anxious.</font>

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll soon be with old friends.</font>

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.</font>

22
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry it couldn't be
under happier circumstances.</font>

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry too.
You are sorry and I am sorry.</font>

24
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know Gradski
thought the world of you.</font>

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he... know...</font>

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before the end
that you two had succeeded?</font>

27
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, he knew. Just...</font>

28
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not in time to save him.</font>

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

30
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After you've been infected with Chimera
for 20 hours, nothing can save you.</font>

31
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not even Bellerophon.</font>

32
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can carry them
together... safely?</font>

33
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you'll get us to safe place
with them in Atlanta, thank God.</font>

35
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is your captain again.
We've experienced a slight...</font>

36
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but abrupt drop in cabin pressure.</font>

37
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a precaution,
I've released the oxygen masks.</font>

38
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please put them on and sit back, relax.</font>

39
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing
to worry about.</font>

40
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you concerned?</font>

41
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not so far.</font>

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just put on your oxygen mask.
I'll see what's going on.</font>

43
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

44
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Denver Center,
this is Trans-Pac 2207, 747 heavy.</font>

45
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're unable to maintain
cabin pressurization.</font>

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've initiated a descent
to one six thousand.</font>

47
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain...</font>

48
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It seems we have
a problem, Dmitri.</font>

49
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You keep calling me Dmitri.
You really shouldn't.</font>

50
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are not Dmitri?</font>

51
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

52
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wallis, hold on to this.</font>

53
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ulrich, remember to pull the...</font>

54
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember to pull
the NO2 tank and dump it.</font>

55
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All done, chief.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, dive, dive!
Checkpoint Charlie in 3,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,</i></font>

65
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>involves the recovery of
a stolen item designated "Chimera"</i></font>

66
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You may select any two team members,</i></font>

67
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but it is essential that the third
team member be Nyah Nordoff-Hall.</i></font>

77
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I won't be on holiday.</font>

78
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see you found it.</font>

79
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

80
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think you're the only one
who can pick a lock?</font>

81
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh. You're not just
a pretty face after all.</font>

82
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you mind if I'm on top?</font>

83
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Either way works for me.</font>

84
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You'll never find it there.
- Damn it!</font>

85
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find what?</font>

86
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His ex's Bulgari necklace
that goes up for auction on Tuesday.</font>

87
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And are you gonna tell me
where it is?</font>

88
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Far left.</font>

89
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is very disconcerting.</font>

90
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you put me here.
I just do as I'm told.</font>

91
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

92
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm!</font>

93
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, who are you,
and what's it gonna cost me?</font>

94
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I wouldn't do that.
- What?</font>

95
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That.</font>

96
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.
Tranquilo. Tranquilo.</font>

97
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Keys, it is you.</font>

98
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is Mr. Keys,
our security engineer. Apologize!</font>

99
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.
No need to apologize.</font>

100
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, Miss Hall, my associate has
your necklace in a very safe place.</font>

101
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But obviously we do feel the alarm
should have gone off a little sooner.</font>

102
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Isn't that right, Miss Hall?
- Hmm? Oh, absolutely.</font>

103
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Much, much too long, I'd say.</font>

104
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Under the circumstances,
I think we'd recommend...</font>

105
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">resetting the sensors
to respond to a lighter load.</font>

106
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you feel
about 40 kilos, Miss Hall?</font>

107
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect.</font>

108
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall we?</font>

109
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miss Hall.
- Hmm?</font>

110
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Haven't you forgotten something?</font>

111
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you trying to do, senorita?
Rob me?</font>

112
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The thought had crossed my mind.</font>

113
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm missing something here, aside
from my half-million-pound necklace.</font>

114
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even after I screwed up the job,</font>

115
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could've walked out of there
with the bloody thing.</font>

116
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least you walked.</font>

117
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did you watch me
go through it all?</font>

118
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to see how good you were.
I was hoping we might work together.</font>

119
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds terrific.
Muchacho.</font>

120
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now be serious.
Whatever you're talking about,</font>

121
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you couldn't possibly want me
after tonight's performance.</font>

122
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You didn't do that badly.
- You apologizing for me?</font>

123
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quite the gentleman.
Gracias.</font>

124
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not really.
I triggered the alarm.</font>

125
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

126
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't do laundry, cook,
or put up with cheeky bastards</font>

127
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who set me up on their territory
so they can poach on mine.</font>

128
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hola.</font>

129
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.
Would you mind slowing down?</font>

130
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did you get this number?
I don't even have it.</font>

131
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like it?</font>

132
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull over and listen to me,
will you? Just listen.</font>

133
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Listen to what?
- I need your help.</font>

134
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And I think you could use mine.
- Your help?</font>

135
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Scotland Yard,</font>

136
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Interpol, every Dutch authority.</font>

137
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can make them all go away.
- Oh, bloody hell.</font>

138
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a spy!
Well, if you want me,</font>

139
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you've gotta catch me!</font>

140
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

141
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You having fun?</font>

142
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

143
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Idiota.</font>

144
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

145
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch the road.
Watch the road.</font>

146
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name?</font>

147
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan Hunt.</font>

148
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Ethan Hunt,</font>

149
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what is it you want
to talk to me about?</font>

150
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot more than I thought.</font>

151
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awfully short notice.</font>

152
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Care to wait a decent interval?</font>

153
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who wants to be decent?</font>

154
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what have you got
against spies?</font>

155
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When they've got
your recruiting technique?</font>

156
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This wasn't exactly by the book.</font>

157
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've got a book for this?</font>

158
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, they've got
a book for everything.</font>

159
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, this thing
these blokes pinched...</font>

160
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know
that they pinched it.</font>

161
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even know
that they're blokes.</font>

162
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I doing here?</font>

163
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I thought I'm supposed to be...</font>

164
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">some kind of thief
to catch a thief.</font>

165
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So do I... sort of.</font>

166
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn, you're beautiful.</font>

167
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Espresso? Cappuccino?</font>

168
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, thanks.
- Sit down. Sit down.</font>

169
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Festival's a pain in the ass.</font>

170
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honoring their saints
by setting them on fire.</font>

171
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lets you know what they think
of saints, doesn't it?</font>

172
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn near set me on fire
on my way over here.</font>

173
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry I barged in
on your vacation.</font>

174
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I didn't
let you know where I was.</font>

175
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be. It wouldn't
be a vacation if you did.</font>

176
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're sorry, and I'm sorry.</font>

177
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did you phrase it like that?</font>

178
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:12,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Like what?
- "You're sorry, I'm sorry."</font>

179
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've gotta be kidding.</font>

180
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Dmitri,
once again I need your help.</font>

181
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just as in the old days, huh?</font>

182
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you saved our lives,
saved our very sanity.</font>

183
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dmitri...</font>

184
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we have this little problem.</font>

185
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every search for a hero...</font>

186
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">must begin with something
that every hero requires...</font>

187
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a villain.</font>

188
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Therefore, in the search
for our hero, Bellerophon,</font>

189
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we created a monster, Chimera.</font>

190
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I beg you, Dmitri,</font>

191
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">come to Sydney and accompany me
to Atlanta immediately.</font>

192
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However we travel,
I must arrive at my destination...</font>

193
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">within 20 hours of departure.</font>

194
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fear I can entrust this
to no one but you.</font>

195
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:25,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dmitri, as we say,
I'm sorry and you're sorry.</font>

196
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have any idea
what the hell he's talking about?</font>

197
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- An idea? Yeah.
- Like?</font>

198
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like it's a good idea
to pick him up in a hurry...</font>

199
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:35,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a bad idea to fly him
on a commercial carrier.</font>

200
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is he still in Sydney?
- Dr. Vladimir Nekhovich is dead.</font>

201
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So is his colleague Gradski,
but that happened earlier.</font>

202
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had Nekhovich on a flight from
Sydney that crashed in the Rockies.</font>

203
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dead?
- Are you listening to me?</font>

204
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he didn't want
to go anywhere without me,</font>

205
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how did you get him
on that flight?</font>

206
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you were there.</font>

207
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I couldn't find you,
I had to replace you.</font>

208
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice.</font>

209
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, he doubled you, what,
2 or 3 times?</font>

210
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Twice.
- What did you think of him?</font>

211
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had our reservations
about each other.</font>

212
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't it a little late
to be asking me that?</font>

213
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not necessarily.
Airline records...</font>

214
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">list a Captain Harold Macintosh
as the pilot of flight 2207.</font>

215
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As far as the media and all
government agencies are concerned,</font>

216
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Macintosh
died on the flight.</font>

217
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But in fact, he missed it.</font>

218
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He did, however,
make the next flight...</font>

219
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in cargo.</font>

220
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stuffed into a rather small suitcase,
considering his size.</font>

221
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, someone on that flight
planned an operation...</font>

222
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">designed to bring the plane down
and make it look like an accident.</font>

223
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone skillful enough to bring
the whole thing off without a hitch.</font>

224
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So there's one thing we know
that Ambrose doesn't.</font>

225
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do think it was Ambrose?
You're not surprised?</font>

226
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless
he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.</font>

227
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The question is why? What was this,
uh, Chimera, Nekhovich was carrying?</font>

228
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only Ambrose knows that.</font>

229
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:32,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In any case, you must recover this...
whatever... Chimera, and bring it to us.</font>

230
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In order to do that, I have to figure
out how he plans to make money with it.</font>

231
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is where Miss Hall comes in.</font>

232
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me?</font>

233
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Hall and Ambrose
had a relationship...</font>

234
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which he took very seriously.</font>

235
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She walked away, and he's been
wanting her back ever since.</font>

236
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We believe she's our surest
and quickest way of locating him.</font>

237
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then what?</font>

238
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, make sure
she continues to see him,</font>

239
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">gets him to confide in her,
and report to you.</font>

240
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You made it sound as if I was recruiting
her for her skills as a thief.</font>

241
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then I misled you,
or you made the wrong assumption.</font>

242
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Either way, we're asking her
to resume a prior relationship,</font>

243
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not do anything
she hasn't already done.</font>

244
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Voluntarily, I might add.</font>

245
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, she's got no training
for this kind of thing.</font>

246
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, to go to bed with a man
and lie to him? She's a woman.</font>

247
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's got all
the training she needs.</font>

248
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
I can get her to do it.</font>

249
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You mean it'll be difficult.
- Very.</font>

250
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, this is not Mission Difficult,
Mr. Hunt, it's Mission Impossible.</font>

251
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Difficult should be
a walk in the park for you.</font>

252
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm open to suggestion.</font>

253
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you can think of a quicker way,
you're welcome to try.</font>

254
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, You might
take a look at these...</font>

255
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you have any further qualms
about getting her to do the job.</font>

256
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many people are capable
of something like that?</font>

257
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sean Ambrose, for one.</font>

258
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

259
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This wasn't what
I had in mind, Nyah.</font>

260
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it is what you'd
like me to do.</font>

261
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Oh, let my conscience
be my guide, is that it?</font>

262
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something like that.</font>

263
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have a conscience.
I'm a bloody thief.</font>

264
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you gonna try
and force me to do this?</font>

265
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Generally, I don't favor
coercing someone,</font>

266
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not when there's a chance
my life could end up in their hands.</font>

267
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that the only reason?
- Can you think of a better one?</font>

268
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me? No.
But I was just hoping that you might,</font>

269
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thinking that somewhere, this got
personal as well as physical!</font>

270
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">OK, OK Would it make you feel any better
if I didn't want you to do this?</font>

271
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, much.
- Then feel better!</font>

272
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Sean will never
be anything but suspicious...</font>

273
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if I pitch up saying,
"Hey, honey, I'm home."</font>

274
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What wouldn't
make him suspicious?</font>

275
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That I needed him
in some urgent way.</font>

276
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Destitute.
In serious trouble.</font>

277
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The kind I couldn't possibly
sort out myself.</font>

278
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Serious trouble, Nyah, is something
that I can always arrange.</font>

279
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This transponder chip
is completely untraceable.</font>

280
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It transmits your location
to a satellite...</font>

281
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which can be read
by only this computer.</font>

282
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can then track you
to within 3 feet.</font>

283
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anywhere.</font>

284
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since your arrest, I've
been sending news bulletins...</font>

285
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to every law enforcement agency
in the world</font>

286
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know Sean Ambrose,</font>

287
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I guarantee
that after that airline crash,</font>

288
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's monitoring
everyone of them.</font>

289
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knows you're there.</font>

290
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he has the means
to get you out.</font>

291
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nyah...</font>

292
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nyah...</font>

293
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna lose you.</font>

294
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan Hunt? G'day, mate.
I'm William Baird. Billy's okay.</font>

295
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything you need me to get,
move or watch, just let me know.</font>

296
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll have a look around.</font>

297
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shit.
- Yes, it is.</font>

298
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This ain't funny.</font>

299
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just bought
these $800 Gucci shoes,</font>

300
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you got me in a helicopter
with this man?</font>

301
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Computer's up. We got her.</font>

302
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's put in the coordinates
and get a visual.</font>

303
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Visuals aren't coming up.</font>

304
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The satellite doesn't work
as fast as I do.</font>

305
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I heard about you, Luther.
Just wanna say it's an honor...</font>

306
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a pleasure
to be working with you blokes.</font>

307
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Isn't there any way
we can speed this up?</font>

308
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With what? This is
the only computer that'll do this.</font>

309
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ohhh!</font>

310
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan, here we go.</font>

311
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aye.</font>

312
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, there's a bloke who knows
how to give a proper welcome.</font>

313
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get me wrong, mate.
You were very friendly also.</font>

314
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it him?
- It's him, Billy.</font>

315
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So we've got him!
- We don't know what we've got.</font>

316
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause we don't know what he's got,</font>

317
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where he's got it or
what he's doing in Sydney with it.</font>

318
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not much luggage.
- I left in a bit of a hurry.</font>

319
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm incredibly grateful, Sean.</font>

320
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How in the world did you find me?</font>

321
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How I usually find you, Nyah.</font>

322
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magic.</font>

323
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm, mmm!
No flies on her.</font>

324
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No bugs, either.
No transmissions.</font>

325
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's clean.</font>

326
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All cats are.</font>

327
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Your room?
- Mmm.</font>

328
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And my room?
- Hmm.</font>

329
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She did it.
She's in the compound.</font>

330
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:23,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? We just rolled up
a snowball and tossed it into hell.</font>

331
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we'll see
what chance it has.</font>

332
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try it on.</font>

333
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead.</font>

334
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm dying to see
if I remembered your size.</font>

335
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not interested
in seeing how it looks?</font>

336
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I am.</font>

337
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Later.</font>

338
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every search for a hero...</font>

339
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">must begin with something
that every hero requires...</font>

340
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a villain.</font>

341
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Therefore, in the search
for our hero, Bellerophon,</font>

342
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we created a monster, Chimera.</font>

343
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nekhovich was
a molecular biologist.</font>

344
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is he going on
about an old Greek myth?</font>

345
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:13,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nekhovich specialized
in recombining DNA molecules.</font>

346
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the myth,</font>

347
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bellerophon was a prince
who killed the Chimera.</font>

348
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A monster with the head of a lion...</font>

349
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the tail of a serpent...</font>

350
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who plagued the ancient world.</font>

351
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think Nekhovich created
a monster virus named Chimera...</font>

352
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the antivirus to kill it,</font>

353
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">named Bellerophon.</font>

354
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That simple, huh?</font>

355
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

356
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">37 million pounds.</font>

357
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, that's a promising bid
for Nekhovich's work.</font>

358
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't look so worried, Hugh.
We're halfway there.</font>

359
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll need this at the track...</font>

360
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if we're gonna get the other half.</font>

361
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then... sorted.</font>

362
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not everything.</font>

363
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think
she's really here?</font>

364
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From her point of view or mine?</font>

365
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, she wasn't
exactly gagging for it...</font>

366
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when she left you 6 months ago.</font>

367
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The question is,
do you trust her?</font>

368
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One considers her timing of course.</font>

369
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Getting nicked within a week
of the plane going down.</font>

370
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suggestive,
even borderline suspicious,</font>

371
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but hardly conclusive.</font>

372
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you've thought about it,
at any rate.</font>

373
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me, Hugh,</font>

374
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you don't exactly hang on Nyah's
every word and gesture, do you?</font>

375
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a fairly ratty nail that.</font>

376
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sean, please!</font>

377
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suppose she is some sort of Trojan horse
sent in by IMF to spy on us.</font>

378
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why should I deny myself
the pleasure of a ride or two?</font>

379
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or don't you think I can learn
more from her than she can from me?</font>

380
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do! I do! I do! I do!</font>

381
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, Hugh,</font>

382
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you must realize that some of us...</font>

383
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have the burden of sex to deal with.</font>

384
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I may or may not know
why she thinks she's here,</font>

385
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:35,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm willing to take the risk,
because, Hugh,</font>

386
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am gagging for it.</font>

387
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

388
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darling! You won!</font>

389
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I suppose I did.
- What made you pick that nag?</font>

390
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's never won a bloody thing.</font>

391
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "Thief in the Night."
- Say no more.</font>

392
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm, uh...</font>

393
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm off to grab a drink.
Do you still favor the Bellinis?</font>

394
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Naturally Vain."</font>

396
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pardon me?</font>

397
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:52,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Naturally Vain... in the fourth.</font>

398
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check her out. She's due.</font>

399
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can speak
as if I'm right by your side.</font>

400
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you?</font>

401
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mounting enclosure
just off the track, 2:00.</font>

402
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's it going?</font>

403
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like old times.</font>

404
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like old times?</font>

405
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just about.</font>

406
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me who you've run into
at Ambrose's.</font>

407
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Near as I can tell, there's about a half
dozen other blokes about the place.</font>

408
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe more.
Hugh Stamp, old friend of Sean's.</font>

409
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's the only one I recognize.
And a bit of a creep and then some.</font>

410
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:02,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know him. He's over your left
shoulder, looking at you right now.</font>

411
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ambrose has photos of newspapers
with money piled on them.</font>

412
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">37 million
on the London Times.</font>

413
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that about?</font>

414
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bids from possible Chimera buyers.</font>

415
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ambrose is meeting
some bloke in the bar.</font>

416
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:34,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big bloke. Ginger hair.
They're into something.</font>

417
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who is this guy?
- Checking now, Ethan.</font>

418
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:54,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John McCloy,
CEO Biocyte Pharmaceuticals.</font>

419
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In 1989, acquired Biocyte
in a hostile takeover.</font>

420
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was Nekhovich's boss.</font>

421
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. He worked for him
as a research scientist at Biocyte.</font>

422
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ambrose is showing something
to McCloy on a digital camera.</font>

423
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever McCloy's
looking at, he's not happy about it.</font>

424
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ambrose just pulled...</font>

425
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the camera's memory card
and put it into an envelope.</font>

426
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put it in his inner left
jacket pocket.</font>

427
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Confirm left jacket pocket.</font>

428
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roger that.</font>

429
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nyah. Nyah, Ambrose
is on his way back to you.</font>

430
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There's an envelope inside...
- His left jacket pocket.</font>

431
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

432
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where do I meet you?
- Betting table 12, off the paddock.</font>

433
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you sure you're up to this?
- I'll muddle through.</font>

434
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There you are!
- See anything you like?</font>

435
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:04,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, yeah.
"Naturally Vain."</font>

436
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:07,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they're about to close
the betting, and I haven't a bean.</font>

437
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nyah!
- Would you mind terribly?</font>

438
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not at all.
But, um, you are gonna pay for it.</font>

439
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And with interest.
- I have no doubt.</font>

440
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on.</font>

441
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put down a thousand for me.</font>

442
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- To win?
- What else?</font>

443
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
- No worries, mate.</font>

444
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
- No worries, mate.</font>

445
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luther, digital camera
ready to transmit.</font>

446

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Betting table 12.</font>

447
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There you go.
- Fine.</font>

448
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:16,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, sorry about that, mate.</font>

449
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say again?</font>

450
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever you're about,
in future, watch your step.</font>

451
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never know who you might run into.</font>

452
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So where's the loo?</font>

453
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:35,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, mate.</font>

454
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you do?</font>

455
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't turn around.</font>

456
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I managed.</font>

457
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You turned around.</font>

458
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you gonna do?
Spank me?</font>

459
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm booted up.
Go, Ethan.</font>

460
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you getting this?</font>

465
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's coming out of the tunnel,
heading your way, mate.</font>

466
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I want you out of Ambrose's place.
- What are you talking about?</font>

467
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happened?
What did you see?</font>

468
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, he's coming up
behind you, Ethan.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've done your job.
I want you out of Australia.</font>

- How do you suggest I go about it?</font>

471

You need to think it over.</font>

Give me the earpiece.</font>

474
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,840

You're dead.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dead, certainly.
But dead is a little extreme.</font>

513
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:39,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the other hand, when my colleague

01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be treated with Bellerophon
within 20 hours?</font>

527
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- By asking me.
- You still don't get it, do you?</font>

528
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:38,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I needed to know just how bad
the disease was in the real world,</font>

529
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:41,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not just the lab.</font>

530
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were genetically splicing
together strains of influenza...</font>

531
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:46,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to create a cure for all influenzas.</font>

532
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:50,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you were also creating
a disease so terrible in Chimera,</font>

533
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the cure would be priceless.</font>

534
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:56,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I needed Chimera in order
to peddle Bellerophon.</font>

535
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:58,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not that difficult
to understand, is it?</font>

536
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:03,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I've got the virus.
You've got the cure.</font>

537
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need them both.</font>

538
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time was a shot of penicillin
would knock off...</font>

539
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">every bloody bug in the zoo.
Not anymore.</font>

540
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:15,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I couldn't make money killing
the microscopic little shits out there,</font>

541
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">well, you'd help me put one out
there that I could make money on.</font>

542
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there it is.
I've confessed.</font>

543
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, John C. McCloy,</font>

544
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">am in business to make money.</font>

545
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:34,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, forget any deal you may have
made with that thug Ambrose.</font>

546
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:38,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me treated,
and let's go back to work.</font>

547
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,</font>

548
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:44,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's a little late for that.</font>

549
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:48,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do give my regards to Gradski...</font>

550
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you see him.</font>

551
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

552
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've heard...</font>

553
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all I need to hear.</font>

554
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nyah...</font>

555
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:24,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's imperative that we do nothing
to alarm Ambrose.</font>

556
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

557
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You told me to get out of there
as soon as possible.</font>

558
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I thought you were here to collect me!
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!</font>

559
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me.
There's no time to talk.</font>

560
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is critical,
absolutely critical,</font>

561
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you do whatever Ambrose asks.</font>

562
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you understand me?</font>

563
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry.</font>

564
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:01,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will all be over...
very soon.</font>

565
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a promise.</font>

566
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on.</font>

567
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on. Off you go.</font>

568
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:52,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luther, we know this much.
Nekhovich gets on a plane...</font>

569
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to go to the Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta.</font>

570
01:03:54,781 --> 01:03:57,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's carrying a virus
he created, Chimera,</font>

571
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:00,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the cure for that virus,
Bellerophon.</font>

572
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ambrose doesn't have the virus.</font>

573
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why Ambrose needs McCloy.</font>

574
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we go into Biocyte, kill Chimera,</font>

575
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ambrose has a cure
without a disease,</font>

576
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we're home free.</font>

577
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were right.
Hunt stung McCloy tonight.</font>

578
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he knows.</font>

579
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll be going into Biocyte.</font>

580
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. Then we'll know
where he'll be, don't we?</font>

581
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done, Hugh.</font>

582
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done.</font>

583
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:58,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oi! You're home, mate. Home.</font>

584
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:03,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's George?</font>

585
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My regular driver?
Where is he?</font>

586
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gone home sick.
Touch of the flu.</font>

587
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is the building up and running yet?
- Mmm.</font>

588
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's not exactly it.
- Sorry, but this is a Biocyte facility.</font>

589
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:23,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their storage structure.
I'll have it up in a minute.</font>

590
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:29,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, take a look at this.
- Start from the inside out.</font>

591
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:32,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All storage and production
of Chimera is done here,</font>

592
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in this lab on the 42nd floor.</font>

593
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunt's target will be the Chimera,</font>

594
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:43,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">stored and manufactured
at Biocyte on the 42nd floor.</font>

595
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:48,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you look at Hunt's
operational history, and I have,</font>

596
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:52,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he invariably favors
misdirection over confrontation.</font>

597
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:57,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll never break into Biocyte from
the bottom where security is heaviest.</font>

598
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No garage entrances.</font>

599
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:04,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lobby's protected by 5 guards
on rotating patrol.</font>

600
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not goin' in from the ground.
Show me the atrium.</font>

601
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The atrium?
One of a kind.</font>

602
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:14,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Runs down through the center
of the building.</font>

603
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:17,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Provides 24-hour natural light via
mirrors and daylight storage cells.</font>

604
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Optimal growing conditions
for the virus.</font>

605
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:24,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ends in a glass floor which doubles
as part of the lab ceiling.</font>

606
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-uh. The atrium roof
closes at sundown.</font>

607
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if the louvers are up for
more than 40 seconds at night,</font>

608
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the civil emergency alarms
are tripped.</font>

609
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:39,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those, even I can't stop.</font>

610
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:41,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan, we have
a total of 40 seconds...</font>

611
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to get you in
and the cables out.</font>

612
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Hunt will prefer to enter
Biocyte somewhere from the top...</font>

613
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where security is minimal.</font>

614
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:55,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll undoubtedly engage
in some aerobatic insanity...</font>

615
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before he'll risk harming a hair
on a security guard's head.</font>

616
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Check-check. Got copy?
- You're 5-by-5.</font>

617
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luther, how we doin'?</font>

618
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not there yet,
Ethan. I'll give you the word.</font>

619
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy, ready to go?</font>

620
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, package away in 5...</font>

621
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not ready.
The louvers aren't moving.</font>

622
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Luther! We gotta go!</font>

623
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, there's a glitch in the access code.</font>

624
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luther, we're out of time. On the count.</font>

625
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, baby, open up, open up.</font>

626
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:01,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 5, 4,
- Come on!</font>

627
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3, 2, 1!</font>

628
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm going now!
- Ethan, wait!</font>

629
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:46,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">25, 24, 23,</font>

630
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:50,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">22, 21, 20.</font>

631
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan, you've got 19 seconds
to clear the cable.</font>

632
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, retracting cable!</font>

633
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

634
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">9, 8, 7, 6,</font>

635
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5, 4, 3, 2...</font>

636
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cable's clear!</font>

637
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:39,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Transponder activated.
Reading package and cable clear.</font>

638
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll breach the lab
at the only possible time,</font>

639
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whether you break in
from the ground or the roof.</font>

640
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's 2300 hours, 1 minute...</font>

641
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:00,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when the air filtration generators will
cover the sound of Hunt's break-in...</font>

642
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:03,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the rotating guards
make the building vulnerable...</font>

643
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to our break-in from below.</font>

644
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:09,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan, the generator's about to go active.</font>

645
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:13,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a friendly reminder. We'll be
out of contact for 8 minutes.</font>

646
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm betting
Hunt will destroy Chimera...</font>

647
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">rather than attempt
to preserve any part of it.</font>

648
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:53,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll have to do it
in 2 places.</font>

649
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:59,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First, the incubation room
where the growth vials are kept.</font>

650
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And finally,
in the inoculation chamber...</font>

651
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">holding the last remaining Chimera
virus in 3 injection guns.</font>

652
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:15,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't be allowed to destroy
the virus in those guns.</font>

653
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's this?
You're on time, for once?</font>

654
01:11:33,181 --> 01:11:34,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not exactly, sport.</font>

655
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:43,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John C. McCloy.</font>

656
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy, I think we've got a problem.</font>

657
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nyah's on the wing up early.
Billy, do you copy?</font>

658
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I got you, Luther.
Sorry, exactly where is she?</font>

659
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- In the building.
- Say again, mate.</font>

660
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds like you're saying
she's in the building.</font>

661
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am. She is.</font>

662
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:25,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, well, then she's not likely
to be alone, is she, mate?</font>

663
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:28,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's in the elevator,
headed towards Ethan.</font>

664
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The question is:
How many of them?</font>

665
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:32,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't get through to Ethan,
not till the generators go.</font>

666
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, well, when's that?
- Not for another...</font>

667
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5-and-a-half minutes.</font>

668
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chimera
in vitro pH and temperature level...</font>

669
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">outside optimal range.</font>

670
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chimera in vitro pH
and temperature level...</font>

671
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">outside optimal range.</font>

672
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:29,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chimera working seed stock pH
at critical level.</font>

673
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alert.
Chimera stock life threatened.</font>

674
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:38,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alert.
Chimera stock life terminated.</font>

675
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:45,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Ethan.
Come on.</font>

676
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:04,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Subject is contaminant-free.</font>

677
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zero contaminant factor.</font>

678
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on,
come on, come on.</font>

679
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:24,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luther, what the hell can we do?</font>

680
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can we do?</font>

681
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope he kills all the bugs before
the yellow dot gets to the red one.</font>

682
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However we travel,</font>

683
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must arrive at my destination
within 20 hours of departure.</font>

684
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How was I to know
that he needed to be treated...</font>

685
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:37,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with Bellerophon within 20 hours?</font>

686
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him.</font>

687
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:27,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much longer
before you can reach him?</font>

688
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:30,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got 29 seconds
before the generators turn off,</font>

689
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:32,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then Ethan will be back on-line.</font>

690
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:48,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh!</font>

691
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:21,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luther! Luther!</font>

692
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold your fire!</font>

693
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold your fire, damn it!</font>

694
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:15,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Hunt...</font>

695
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:17,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how've you been?</font>

696
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:21,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fighting a bit of a cold.</font>

697
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:24,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aww.</font>

698
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:29,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, that was the hardest part
of having to portray you...</font>

699
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:33,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">grinning like an idiot
every 15 minutes.</font>

700
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:37,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would've thought the hardest part was
curbing that pressing need of yours...</font>

701
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to get your gun off.</font>

702
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:42,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were in such a hurry
to knock off that 747...</font>

703
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:45,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you never figured out
where Chimera really was.</font>

704
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I knew where it was.
- Oh.</font>

705
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:51,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you knew the only way Nekhovich
could smuggle the live virus...</font>

706
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:55,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is by injecting himself and using
his own bloodstream as a petri dish.</font>

707
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You knew that...
while you were knocking him off,</font>

708
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:01,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">destroying the very thing
you came for.</font>

709
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:11,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!
Put a sock in it!</font>

710
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:17,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hit that bloody gun, and you'll
spray the virus all over the place!</font>

711
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There it is, guys.</font>

712
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:25,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last of it.</font>

713
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was the top bid?</font>

714
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:30,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why? You gonna make me
a better offer?</font>

715
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:34,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Than 37 million pounds?
Not really.</font>

716
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

717
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:40,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody has been slipping you
our mail.</font>

718
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:44,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on out here, you bad girl.</font>

719
01:19:56,220 --> 01:20:01,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sean, she doesn't belong here.
Let her go.</font>

720
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:05,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She wouldn't be here...</font>

721
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:08,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if it wasn't for you, Hunt.</font>

722
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:19,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From this moment, you are
responsible for what happens to her.</font>

723
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:22,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you're looking out
for her well-being,</font>

724
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:27,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suggest you advise her to pick up
the injection gun and bring it to me.</font>

725
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:31,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ball's in your court, Hunt.</font>

726
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:43,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nyah's in the building.
Do you copy?</font>

727
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:45,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

728
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:04,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know he won't shoot you
the minute he's got it?</font>

729
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:07,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please. One can't hold Nyah
responsible for her actions.</font>

730
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:10,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know women, mate.
Like monkeys they are.</font>

731
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:15,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Won't let go of one branch
till they get a grip on the next!</font>

732
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:20,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get it, Nyah.
I'll cover you.</font>

733
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am waiting.</font>

734
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:11,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things haven't exactly worked out the
way you thought they would, Ethan.</font>

735
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

736
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:33,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bitch!</font>

737
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:52,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not gonna shoot me, Sean.
Not this bitch.</font>

738
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:55,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause she's worth 37 million pounds.</font>

739
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:30,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did you think you were doing?
- I wasn't thinking!</font>

740
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just trying to stop you
from getting hurt, that's all!</font>

741
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:37,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You who don't have a conscience.</font>

742
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I lied.</font>

743
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't get us both
out of here, can you?</font>

744
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:24,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm infected with Chimera.</font>

745
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:26,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know you don't have a choice.
Just do it.</font>

746
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:30,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it now!</font>

747
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:53,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got 19 hours and 58 minutes!</font>

748
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:57,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get Bellerophon
into your system before then!</font>

749
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:04,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stay alive!
I'm not going to lose you!</font>

750
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:17,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feel like pleading for your life?</font>

751
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:25,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then, how about dying...</font>

752
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:29,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you can make me a lot of money?</font>

753
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:39,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In just a few hours time,
you can be assured...</font>

754
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:42,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of going down in history
as the Typhoid Mary of Oz.</font>

755
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodday.</font>

756
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:52,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's not a chance of locating Nyah
until can access the satellite.</font>

757
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:55,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's not a chance of doing that
until I can get this computer fixed.</font>

758
01:26:55,781 --> 01:26:57,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that takes you awhile</font>

759
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much time does she have left?</font>

760
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:02,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not long. But whatever happens,
Nyah will take care of Nyah.</font>

761
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:05,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you mean?
- Unless we dose her with Bellerophon,</font>

762
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nyah will kill herself.</font>

763
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So first things first.</font>

764
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan, Ambrose and his team
have arrived...</font>

765
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:10,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over the bridge,
and Nyah's not with him, mate.</font>

766
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:12,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Copy that.</font>

767
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:22,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right, mate? Looks like
pretty heavy security from here.</font>

768
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's it look like from there?</font>

769
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Risky.</font>

770
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:50,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Simon? Simon!</font>

771
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:52,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay here.</font>

772
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Breached the structure
at the 10:00 grating.</font>

773
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:27,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a DNA match.
The blood's loaded with Chimera.</font>

774
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:39,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they certainly have Bellerophon.</font>

775
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:43,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then you've got
both the virus and the anti-virus,</font>

776
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:46,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which means I've got
30 million for you.</font>

777
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:50,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not exactly.
We don't want just your cash.</font>

778
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:54,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you want?
- Stock, Mr. McCloy.</font>

779
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:58,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stock options,
to be a little more precise.</font>

780
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:09,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut her loose...
right in the center of town.</font>

781
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:11,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The more crowded the better.</font>

782
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:16,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan, just picked up an Ambrose's call.
Nyah's been dropped off.</font>

783
01:31:16,921 --> 01:31:18,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think she's still alive.</font>

784
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:21,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where is she?
- Somewhere in Sydney.</font>

785
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somewhere in Sydney?
Care to harden the target?</font>

786
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't until...</font>

787
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can get the GPS up on our computer.
It's still down.</font>

788
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:43,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The clock is ticking.</font>

789
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:46,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How quickly can you manufacture
more of the anti-virus?</font>

790
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No time at all,
once I've got it.</font>

791
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:52,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. Biocyte stock is just a few weeks
away from going through the roof.</font>

792
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:55,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you talking about?
- An outbreak of Chimera.</font>

793
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:59,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where?
- Downtown Sydney, for a start.</font>

794
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:01,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You create the supply, Mr. McCloy.</font>

795
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've just created the demand.</font>

796
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:05,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 million people in Sydney...</font>

797
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:07,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and 17 million people in Australia...</font>

798
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:10,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are going to need Bellerophon
within the next few days,</font>

799
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:12,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not to mention
the rest of the world.</font>

800
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:14,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this is how
it's going to work.</font>

801
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:17,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wallis, the shares outstanding are?
- 93.4 million.</font>

802
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:22,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which means, Mr. McCloy, we need to
get our hands on 480,000 options.</font>

803
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:25,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll borrow your 30 million
to buy those options.</font>

804
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:29,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your stock has never sold
above $31 a share.</font>

805
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When your stock goes north of 200 which...</font>

806
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:36,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it will, those options
will be worth billions,</font>

807
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:41,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I will own 51% of Biocyte.</font>

808
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:44,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is outrageous.</font>

809
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:47,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will not let you
take control of my company.</font>

810
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:50,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit down.</font>

811
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:33,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be a billionaire.
It's better than being broke.</font>

812
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have terrorists and...</font>

813
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">other pharmaceutical
companies standing in line.</font>

814
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:46,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ball's in your court,
Mr. McCloy.</font>

815
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:44,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run that bastard down.</font>

816
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:02,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're running short on time, Mr. McCloy.</font>

817
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:06,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have got to conclude
our business.</font>

818
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:10,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Start the transfer.</font>

819
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:21,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow it...
and let me know.</font>

820
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:27,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh!</font>

821
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:31,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raise your hands very slowly.</font>

822
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure you want me to do this?</font>

823
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:38,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raise your hands very slowly.</font>

824
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:14,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan, Ethan, do you copy?
Do you copy?</font>

825
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:21,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep it going!</font>

826
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:33,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sean, this rat's reached
the end of the maze.</font>

827
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:36,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he alive?</font>

828
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:38,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, more or less.</font>

829
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:42,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring him to me.</font>

830
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:43,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

831
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:53,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sean, transfer completed.</font>

832
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:18,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done, Stamp.
Well done.</font>

833
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:39,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop mumbling!</font>

834
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid he's got no choice.</font>

835
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe I broke his jaw.</font>

836
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stamp, I'm impressed.</font>

837
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:50,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. We don't have
a lot of time, Hunt.</font>

838
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:53,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What ever you got to say,
say it now.</font>

839
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:58,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about giving us a big smile?</font>

840
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:03,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No?
- What are you doing?</font>

841
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:08,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down on your knees.</font>

842
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:15,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this is what's known...</font>

843
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:17,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as getting your gun off.</font>

844
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:30,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There he is!</font>

845
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:42,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan!</font>

846
01:40:57,700 --> 01:41:00,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just back off
and pinpoint your positions!</font>

847
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:01,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luther, clear the bridge for me!</font>

848
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:08,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunt's heading for the bridge,
coming in at 12:00 high.</font>

849
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:27,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm mad now.</font>

850
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:08,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ha-ha!</font>

851
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:41,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You all right, mate?
- That punk put a hole in my Versace!</font>

852
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:47,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan, the computer's up.
I've got Nyah.</font>

853
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:49,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's moved out of the city.</font>

854
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:51,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's on the north head bluff
approaching the cliffs.</font>

855
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But I can't get a visual.
- Copy!</font>

856
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's only got
a little time left!</font>

857
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Track ahead and pick her up!</font>

858
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:10,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't get a good shot.
- Ethan, we won't be able to cover you!</font>

859
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:13,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My earpiece is failing!
You've got me on GPS!</font>

860
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:15,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring her to me!</font>

861
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:27,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy, north head bluff.
Haul ass.</font>

862
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:57,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get out there and keep firing!
- I can't see anything!</font>

863
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:00,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow down, mate!
Slow down!</font>

864
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Range is 2K.</font>

865
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:54,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahhh!</font>

866
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:39,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead.
Use it, Hunt.</font>

867
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:41,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a bad way to go.</font>

868
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:45,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a lot better than
the way that bitch is gonna die.</font>

869
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:35,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, there she is!</font>

870
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:42,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunt!</font>

871
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:47,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should've killed me.</font>

872
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:29,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Hall's blood, it appears,</font>

873
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:31,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has absolutely no elements
of the Chimera virus,</font>

874
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not even anti-bodies.</font>

875
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:36,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. I gathered as much.</font>

876
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:38,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you were under specific
instructions, Mr. Hunt,</font>

877
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:41,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to bring back a living sample
of the Chimera virus.</font>

878
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:45,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be very interested to know how,
after you managed this recovery,</font>

879
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:48,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it subsequently got destroyed.</font>

880
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By fire.
It's the best way, really.</font>

881
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:55,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Well, Mr. Hunt,</font>

882
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:59,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as for Miss Hall,
in light of her efforts,</font>

883
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:03,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">her criminal record
will certainly be expunged.</font>

884
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:07,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wiped out.
I'm assuming you approve.</font>

885
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:12,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do.</font>

886
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:17,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Where is she now, by the way?
Any idea?</font>

887
01:57:17,480 --> 01:57:20,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.
Not exactly.</font>

888
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:23,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what are your plans?</font>

889
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:27,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.
Uh, some sort of vacation.</font>

890
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:29,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll let you know where I'm going.</font>

891
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:32,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to do that.</font>

892
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:35,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wouldn't be a vacation
if you did.</font>

893
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:27,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get lost.</font>
