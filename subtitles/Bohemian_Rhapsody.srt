<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me. Thanks.</font>

89
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:56,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you found me, then.</font>

90
00:09:56,702 --> 00:09:58,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How can I help you?
- Oh.</font>

91
00:09:58,538 --> 00:10:00,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, I rather liked these.</font>

92

you have them in my size?</font>

93
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:05,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the ladies' section,
so I'm not exactly sure.</font>

94
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:09,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There wasn't a sign
or anything.</font>

95

really matter, do you?</font>

96
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:22,195

138
00:13:55,808 --> 00:13:59,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's counterclockwise,
I think you'll find, John.</font>

139
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:00,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, is it?
Thank you, Brian.</font>

140
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:02,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to do it?
Please, feel free.</font>

141
00:14:02,414 --> 00:14:03,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.
Doing a good job.</font>

142
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We sold out every pub and uni
south of Glasgow...</font>

143
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:08,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm stuck
in the middle of nowhere,</font>

144
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:09,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">eating a ham sandwich!</font>

145
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:12,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trouble is, we're just not
thinking big enough.</font>

146
00:14:12,358 --> 00:14:13,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you
got in mind, Fred?</font>

147
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:14,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An album.</font>

148
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:16,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't afford an album.</font>

149
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:18,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, we'll find a way.</font>

150
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much do you think
we can get for this van?</font>

151
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:26,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you're joking.</font>

152
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:29,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's 3 months' wages.</font>

153
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:31,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And a perfectly good van.</font>

154
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:32,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be so dramatic,
darling.</font>

155
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:35,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're recording
an album tonight. Let's go!</font>

156
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you think
I sound like shit?</font>

157
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:45,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's good.</font>

158
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can we try it again?
- Sure, yeah.</font>

159
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:49,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, it's your money.</font>

160
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Literally.</font>

161
00:15:01,073 --> 00:15:02,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds a lot better.</font>

162
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to
get experimental.</font>

163
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:08,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try bouncing us left and right
for the ah-ah-ahs.</font>

164
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:17,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now dead center for the last.</font>

165
00:15:17,023 --> 00:15:18,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then blast it!</font>

166
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:19,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

167
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:27,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's good, right?</font>

168
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:32,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do we have time
to stack a few more?</font>

169
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:35,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The studio opens at 8:00,
so we got 30 more minutes.</font>

170
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:41,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

171
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:46,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That sounds good, right?
- Yeah.</font>

172
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:57,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oi, RT, who are these kids
in the box?</font>

173
00:15:57,597 --> 00:16:01,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A student band
doing some weird stuff.</font>

174
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:03,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about demos?
You got some?</font>

175
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:04,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Been up all night,
mate.</font>

176
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:17,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So the new name is Queen?</font>

177
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As in "Her Royal Highness."</font>

178
00:16:19,217 --> 00:16:20,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And because
it's outrageous...</font>

179
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I can't think of anyone
more outrageous than me.</font>

180
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:34,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the most
impractical bed.</font>

181
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:47,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's beautiful.</font>

182
00:16:59,992 --> 00:17:01,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think it has potential.</font>

183
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:14,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I have to go to work.
- I simply won't allow it.</font>

184
00:17:14,306 --> 00:17:16,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to support me
if I get fired?</font>

185
00:17:17,377 --> 00:17:19,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll always
look after you.</font>

186
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to...</font>

187
00:17:21,113 --> 00:17:22,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to be late.</font>

188
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:36,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How beautiful you are.</font>

189
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:47,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I was a little girl...</font>

190
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:51,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to run around the house
and hide and...</font>

191
00:17:51,378 --> 00:17:52,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he couldn't find me.</font>

192
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:55,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clever girl.</font>

193
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please tell your father
it's nice to meet him.</font>

194
00:17:58,184 --> 00:17:59,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have.</font>

195
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:02,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then thank him
for the lovely birthday cake.</font>

196
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have.</font>

197
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then tell him his daughter's
an epic shag.</font>

198
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie,
he can read lips.</font>

199
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mary...</font>

200
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:15,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't tell you how long
I have waited for Farrokh...</font>

201
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:17,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to bring home
a nice girl like you.</font>

202
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:18,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Farrokh?</font>

203
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:21,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did Farrokh not tell you
he was born in Zanzibar?</font>

204
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, he did not.
- I used to know a girl</font>

205
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:24,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- who was Zanzibari.
- 1 minute.</font>

206
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:26,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought Freddie
was born in London.</font>

207
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:29,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, he was. At the age of 18.
- Shut up.</font>

208
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our family is
Indian Parsee.</font>

209
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mum. Mum, Mum.
- Mary...</font>

210
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:34,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mum.
- Mum, please...</font>

211
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:35,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. Have a look at these.</font>

212
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:36,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes. Yeah.
- Please! Please.</font>

213
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:38,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No stopping.
- We need to see those.</font>

214
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:40,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A thousand years ago,</font>

215
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:42,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Parsees fled to India
from Persia...</font>

216
00:18:42,794 --> 00:18:44,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to escape Muslim persecution.</font>

217
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:46,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?
That's terrible.</font>

218
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:48,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So why did you
leave Zanzibar?</font>

219
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We didn't leave.</font>

220
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:50,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's so small.</font>

221
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:52,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were chased out with just
the clothes on our backs.</font>

222
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:54,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was quite a good boxer,
actually.</font>

223
00:18:55,941 --> 00:18:57,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had to be.</font>

224
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:58,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His opponents
went for his teeth</font>

225
00:18:58,343 --> 00:18:59,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">always trying to
punch them in.</font>

226
00:18:59,644 --> 00:19:01,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Certainly a target.</font>

227
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:04,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So how old is he
in this photo?</font>

228
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think 3
or 4 years old.</font>

229
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:06,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?
Boxing already at that age?</font>

230
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:07,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So good.</font>

231
00:19:10,422 --> 00:19:11,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mercury?</font>

232
00:19:12,257 --> 00:19:13,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No looking back.</font>

233
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:15,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only forward.</font>

234
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:17,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So now the family name's
not good enough for you?</font>

235
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:18,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a stage name.</font>

236
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:20,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not.</font>

237
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:23,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I changed it legally.</font>

238
00:19:23,503 --> 00:19:25,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got a new passport
and everything.</font>

239
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kash, how old are you here?</font>

240
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:30,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

241
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:31,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was before Freddie went off
to boarding school.</font>

242
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:34,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sent Farrokh away to make
a good Parsee boy of him.</font>

243
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:36,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was too wild and unruly.</font>

244
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:37,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what good did it do?</font>

245
00:19:37,382 --> 00:19:40,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good thoughts,
good words, good deeds.</font>

246
00:19:42,988 --> 00:19:43,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't get anywhere</font>

247
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:45,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pretending to be
someone you're not.</font>

248
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who'd like some cake?</font>

249
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:49,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cake is always good.</font>

250
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:50,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

251
00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:51,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a moment.</font>

252
00:19:51,997 --> 00:19:52,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie Mercury.</font>

253
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:54,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Phone call.</font>

254
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:56,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quite like
the sound of that.</font>

255
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:59,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie tells me that you're
some sort of a scientist.</font>

256
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:01,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Astrophysics, actually.
- Oh.</font>

257
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, my father would've
preferred it if I continued.</font>

258
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- When?
- That's very clever.</font>

259
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:06,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's a dentist.
- I was never a dentist.</font>

260
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:07,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a picture
I want to see.</font>

261
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a dentist.</font>

262
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:10,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see.</font>

263
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's also quite clever,
actually.</font>

264
00:20:12,384 --> 00:20:13,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kash...</font>

265
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:15,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what are you doing later?</font>

266
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:16,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Homework.</font>

267
00:20:20,226 --> 00:20:21,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just making conversation.</font>

268
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:22,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of music</font>

269
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:23,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was he listening to
back in those days?</font>

270
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:26,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, he was listening to
Little Richard.</font>

271
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:30,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Very good.
- Richard, yeah.</font>

272
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And his first band...</font>

273
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:33,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an announcement.</font>

274
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the A&R men...</font>

275
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:41,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from EMI saw us recording.</font>

276
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:43,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gave our demo
to John Reid.</font>

277
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:46,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He looks after Elton John.</font>

278
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:47,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

279
00:20:47,652 --> 00:20:48,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Reid wants to meet us...</font>

280
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:51,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and possibly, even manage us.</font>

281
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:53,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shut up.
- You're joking!</font>

282
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:55,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

283
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:04,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're sure
he said 12 o'clock?</font>

284
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:06,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. "Midday at
the pub, don't be drunk."</font>

285
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:07,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what he said.</font>

286
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:08,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look
a bit nervous, Brian.</font>

287
00:21:08,673 --> 00:21:09,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John, I'm fine.</font>

288
00:21:09,742 --> 00:21:10,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're usually
so particular.</font>

289
00:21:10,876 --> 00:21:11,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just gotta be cool.</font>

290
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:13,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wow!
- Wanker.</font>

291
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:15,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know
it was fancy dress, Fred.</font>

292
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:17,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've gotta make
an impression, darling.</font>

293
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like
an angry lizard.</font>

294
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:22,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's your best work.
- Very subtle.</font>

295
00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:23,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gonna fly away?</font>

296
00:21:25,425 --> 00:21:27,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I borrow it
for Sunday church?</font>

297
00:21:36,736 --> 00:21:38,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, this is Queen.</font>

298
00:21:38,905 --> 00:21:42,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you must be
Freddie Mercury.</font>

299
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:43,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got a gift.</font>

300
00:21:43,575 --> 00:21:45,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all have.</font>

301
00:21:45,312 --> 00:21:46,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So tell me...</font>

302
00:21:46,411 --> 00:21:47,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what makes Queen
any different</font>

303
00:21:47,613 --> 00:21:50,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from all the other
wannabe rock stars I meet?</font>

304
00:21:51,784 --> 00:21:54,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you what it is.</font>

305
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:56,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're 4 misfits
who don't belong together,</font>

307

<font face="Comic Sans MS">The outcasts right at the back
of the room...</font>

308
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:03,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who are pretty sure
they don't belong either.</font>

309
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:06,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We belong to them.</font>

310
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:08,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're a family.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">But no 2 of us
are the same.</font>

- Hurry up.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand that
it's the policy of the BBC.</font>

to the band, please.</font>

it is going to be playback.</font>

338
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:01,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lip synch's
all that's required.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">We do know how to
play our instruments.</font>

341
00:23:05,124 --> 00:23:07,524

we can't simply perform live.</font>

the difference.</font>

408
00:26:58,091 --> 00:27:00,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has a little tour
in mind for us.</font>

409
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not little,
Brian.</font>

410
00:27:03,728 --> 00:27:05,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's booked us a tour
of America.</font>

411
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:11,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The album's hit the charts
in the U.S.!</font>

412
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:13,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes!</font>

413
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:18,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

414
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

415
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's happening!</font>

416
00:27:28,254 --> 00:27:30,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Now, who wants to take a ride?</i></font>

417
00:28:00,453 --> 00:28:02,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We love you, Cleveland!</i></font>

418
00:28:02,921 --> 00:28:04,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We love you, Houston!</i></font>

419
00:28:05,923 --> 00:28:07,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We love you, Denver!
Very happy to be here!</i></font>

420
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And are the crowds big?</i></font>

421
00:28:13,098 --> 00:28:14,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we're selling out
every night.</font>

422
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:16,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wish you were here
to see it.</font>

423
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:17,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They really love us.</i></font>

424
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:21,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We love you, Portland!</i></font>

425
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:27,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He's got a big ass, too!</i></font>

426
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:29,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We love you, New Orleans!</i></font>

427
00:28:32,884 --> 00:28:35,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We love you, Atlanta!</i></font>

428
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:41,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Rog, come down here
and say hello.</i></font>

429
00:28:41,026 --> 00:28:42,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We love you, Pittsburgh!</i></font>

430
00:28:42,894 --> 00:28:45,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Roger!
<i>- Now, hit it!</i></font>

431
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:46,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm good.
I just miss you.</i></font>

432
00:28:46,832 --> 00:28:48,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

433
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:50,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't possibly be having
any fun without me.</font>

434
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:52,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Nothing as exciting
as America.</i></font>

435
00:29:04,283 --> 00:29:05,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say hi to the boys for me.</font>

436
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will. Love you.</font>

437
00:29:09,054 --> 00:29:10,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye, Freddie. I love you.</font>

438
00:30:08,746 --> 00:30:10,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

439
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:13,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're late.
- Am I?</font>

440
00:30:13,018 --> 00:30:14,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We saved you a seat.</font>

441
00:30:14,653 --> 00:30:15,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lovely.
- Okay.</font>

442
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:17,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, now that
we're all here...</font>

443
00:30:17,188 --> 00:30:19,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim, this is Ray Foster.</font>

444
00:30:19,158 --> 00:30:21,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ray, this is the
band's lawyer, Jim Beach.</font>

445
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

446
00:30:22,128 --> 00:30:23,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must stop
calling him that.</font>

447
00:30:23,528 --> 00:30:24,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's his name.</font>

448
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:27,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we cannot keep
calling him "Jim Beach."</font>

449
00:30:27,265 --> 00:30:30,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's absurd, not to
mention, unspeakably boring.</font>

450
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:34,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miami.</font>

451
00:30:34,974 --> 00:30:38,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From now on,
I dub thee "Miami Beach."</font>

452
00:30:39,477 --> 00:30:41,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sun always sets
behind you, doesn't it?</font>

453
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On Miami Beach.</font>

454
00:30:44,983 --> 00:30:46,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm, right.</font>

455
00:30:46,217 --> 00:30:48,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that everybody's
got an acceptable name...</font>

456
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let's get to it.
Look...</font>

457
00:30:50,323 --> 00:30:52,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we just really need
something special.</font>

458
00:30:53,426 --> 00:30:54,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More hits...</font>

459
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:55,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like Killer Queen...</font>

460
00:30:56,428 --> 00:30:57,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">only bigger.</font>

461
00:30:57,428 --> 00:30:59,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not bloody widgets
we're making.</font>

462
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't just
reproduce Killer Queen.</font>

463
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:03,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

464
00:31:04,969 --> 00:31:06,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can do better.</font>

465
00:31:16,715 --> 00:31:18,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's opera.</font>

466
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Opera!
- Opera!</font>

467
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:21,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There seems to be
an echo in here.</font>

468
00:31:51,249 --> 00:31:53,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, we don't want to
repeat ourselves.</font>

469
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:55,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The same formula
over and over.</font>

470
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Formulas are a complete
and utter waste of time.</font>

471
00:31:59,157 --> 00:32:00,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Formulas work.</font>

472
00:32:00,492 --> 00:32:02,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's stick
with the formulas.</font>

473
00:32:02,093 --> 00:32:03,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like formulas.</font>

474
00:32:03,227 --> 00:32:04,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll call the album...</font>

475
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A Night at the Opera.</i></font>

476
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you aware that no one
actually likes opera?</font>

477
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like opera.</font>

478
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:16,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you?
- I do.</font>

479
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, don't
misunderstand, darling.</font>

480
00:32:18,008 --> 00:32:19,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a rock and roll record...</font>

481
00:32:19,945 --> 00:32:21,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the scale of opera...</font>

482
00:32:21,246 --> 00:32:23,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the pathos of Greek tragedy...</font>

483
00:32:23,282 --> 00:32:25,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the wit of Shakespeare...</font>

484
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:29,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the unbridled joy
of musical theater.</font>

485
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:31,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's a musical experience.
- Yeah.</font>

486
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rather than just
another record.</font>

487
00:32:34,092 --> 00:32:36,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something for everyone...</font>

488
00:32:36,194 --> 00:32:37,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something...</font>

489
00:32:38,596 --> 00:32:39,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

490
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:42,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something that will make
people feel belongs to them.</font>

491
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll mix genres,
we'll cross boundaries...</font>

492
00:32:46,738 --> 00:32:49,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we'll speak in bloody tongues
if we want to.</font>

493
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no musical ghetto
that can contain us.</font>

494
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:53,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's it.
- No one knows what Queen means</font>

495
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:55,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because it doesn't mean
one thing.</font>

496
00:32:59,016 --> 00:33:00,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think, John?</font>

497
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:01,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I...</font>

498
00:33:02,388 --> 00:33:03,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">agree with the band.</font>

499
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:04,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course you do.</font>

500
00:33:06,358 --> 00:33:08,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about you, uh...</font>

501
00:33:08,026 --> 00:33:10,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miami.
- Hmm.</font>

502
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:12,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fortune favors the bold.</font>

503
00:33:13,832 --> 00:33:15,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surely, a man of your...</font>

504
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:18,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unique taste...</font>

505
00:33:18,437 --> 00:33:20,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">isn't afraid
of a little risk?</font>

506
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't make me
regret this.</font>

507
00:33:26,144 --> 00:33:27,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're fun.</font>

508
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:41,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Recording studio?</font>

509
00:33:42,727 --> 00:33:45,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the idea was to get away
from all distractions.</font>

510
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:49,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, I know it's not
the Ritz. Not even close.</font>

511
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:53,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Roger, you're in here.
- Right.</font>

512
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie, this is you.
Biggest room.</font>

513
00:33:56,006 --> 00:33:58,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brian, that's you.</font>

514
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:00,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John, you're downstairs.</font>

515
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:07,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And...</font>

516
00:34:09,053 --> 00:34:11,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is all yours, John.</font>

517
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smaller rooms
don't get nearly as cold.</font>

518
00:34:15,961 --> 00:34:17,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

519
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:37,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

520
00:34:47,157 --> 00:34:49,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's really good.</font>

521
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:09,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Love of my
life, you've hurt me</i></font>

522
00:35:11,282 --> 00:35:15,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> You've broken my heart</i></font>

523
00:35:15,452 --> 00:35:22,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> And now you leave me</i></font>

524
00:35:23,294 --> 00:35:27,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Love of my life,
can't you see?</i></font>

525
00:35:29,534 --> 00:35:33,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Bring it back, bring it back</i></font>

526
00:35:34,606 --> 00:35:37,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Bring it back,
bring it back</i></font>

527
00:35:37,175 --> 00:35:41,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Don't take it away from me</i></font>

528
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Because you don't know</i></font>

529
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:50,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> What it means to me </i></font>

530
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:54,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

531
00:36:00,198 --> 00:36:01,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's beautiful.</font>

532
00:36:08,106 --> 00:36:09,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's it called?</font>

533
00:36:10,675 --> 00:36:13,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Love of My Life.</i>
I wrote it for Mary.</font>

534
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you say so.</font>

535
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't misunderstand, Paul.</font>

536
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:03,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mary knows me in a way
that no one else ever will.</font>

537
00:37:06,831 --> 00:37:08,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you, Freddie Mercury.</font>

538
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what you think?</font>

539
00:37:10,635 --> 00:37:13,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, you don't know me.</font>

540
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:15,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just see
what you want to see.</font>

541
00:37:15,941 --> 00:37:18,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We work together.
That's all.</font>

542
00:37:26,117 --> 00:37:28,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I put my heart and soul
into this song.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

573
00:38:24,943 --> 00:38:27,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause you know your song
isn't strong enough.</font>

00:53:15,331 --> 00:53:17,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thousands of them.</font>

813
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:22,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All singing to you.</font>

814
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it's true.</font>

815
00:53:36,153 --> 00:53:38,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie, what's wrong?</font>

816
00:53:38,655 --> 00:53:40,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Love of my life,
don't leave me</i></font>

817
00:53:41,492 --> 00:53:44,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> You've stolen my love</i></font>

818
00:53:44,727 --> 00:53:47,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> And now desert me </i></font>

819
00:53:49,032 --> 00:53:52,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something's been wrong
for a while now.</font>

820
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say it.</font>

821
00:54:06,249 --> 00:54:08,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say it.</font>

822
00:54:14,457 --> 00:54:17,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been thinking
about it a lot.</font>

823
00:54:23,401 --> 00:54:24,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm bisexual.</font>

824
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:29,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie, you're gay.</font>

825
00:54:48,191 --> 00:54:49,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've known for a while now.</font>

826
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just didn't want to
admit it.</font>

827
00:54:54,197 --> 00:54:56,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's funny, really. This is
what I always settle for.</font>

828
00:54:58,403 --> 00:54:59,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I love you, but..."</font>

829
00:54:59,802 --> 00:55:02,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I love you, Mary,
but I need space."</font>

830
00:55:02,972 --> 00:55:06,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I love you, Mary,
but I've met someone else."</font>

831
00:55:06,943 --> 00:55:09,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now,
"I love you, but I'm..."</font>

832
00:55:15,785 --> 00:55:17,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this is the hardest,</font>

833
00:55:17,387 --> 00:55:20,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because it's not
even your fault.</font>

834
00:55:34,204 --> 00:55:36,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, don't take it off.</font>

835
00:55:37,173 --> 00:55:38,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't take it off.</font>

836
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:39,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You promised me
you'd never take it off.</font>

837
00:55:43,213 --> 00:55:45,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want from me?</font>

838
00:55:51,555 --> 00:55:53,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Almost everything.</font>

839
00:55:56,593 --> 00:55:59,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you in my life.</font>

840
00:56:00,863 --> 00:56:01,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

841
00:56:05,302 --> 00:56:08,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We believe in each other.</font>

842
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:11,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's everything.</font>

843
00:56:13,677 --> 00:56:15,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For us.</font>

844
00:56:25,689 --> 00:56:29,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your life is going to be
very difficult.</font>

845
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:04,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think?</font>

846
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:07,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gay-er?</font>

847
00:57:07,463 --> 00:57:10,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not this, darling, the house.</font>

848
00:57:10,101 --> 00:57:11,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't it amazing?</font>

849
00:57:11,934 --> 00:57:13,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mary's already
moved in next door,</font>

850
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:15,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so she can visit
the cats and me.</font>

851
00:57:15,773 --> 00:57:16,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh.</font>

852
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Each cat will have
his own room.</font>

853
00:57:18,709 --> 00:57:20,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Delilah's by the kitchen...</font>

854
00:57:20,644 --> 00:57:22,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miko's next door.</font>

855
00:57:22,111 --> 00:57:24,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tiffany, Oscar, Romeo,
all upstairs.</font>

856
00:57:24,381 --> 00:57:28,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lilly's room is even larger
than this one! Spoilt thing.</font>

857
00:57:28,918 --> 00:57:29,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm not sure</font>

858
00:57:29,986 --> 00:57:31,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the echo is quite
pronounced enough.</font>

859
00:57:31,822 --> 00:57:34,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eh-oh!</font>

860
00:57:36,093 --> 00:57:38,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I knew
you'd appreciate it.</font>

861
00:57:39,597 --> 00:57:41,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay for dinner.</font>

862
00:57:41,198 --> 00:57:42,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything you fancy.</font>

863
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:45,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't.
Wife, kids, you know.</font>

864
00:57:47,271 --> 00:57:48,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

865
00:57:50,608 --> 00:57:52,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, come on.
We'll eat off the floor.</font>

866
00:57:52,543 --> 00:57:54,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's clean enough.</font>

867
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:55,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another time, Fred.</font>

868
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Hello?</i>
- Mary.</font>

869
00:58:14,764 --> 00:58:17,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi.
- <i>Hello, my love.</i></font>

870
00:58:17,066 --> 00:58:18,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hi.</i></font>

871
00:58:18,168 --> 00:58:20,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to do
something for me.</font>

872
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:22,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can't
ask any questions.</font>

873
00:58:22,939 --> 00:58:24,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie, what are you
doing this time?</font>

874
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I just told you...
you can't ask any questions.</font>

875
00:58:28,778 --> 00:58:31,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Right.</i></font>

876
00:58:31,014 --> 00:58:33,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to go
to your bedroom window.</font>

877
00:58:34,852 --> 00:58:36,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Look out of it.</i></font>

878
00:58:45,762 --> 00:58:48,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you see me?
- <i>Yes, I do see you.</i></font>

879
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:50,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you do the same.</font>

880
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:54,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

881
00:59:02,646 --> 00:59:04,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep yours on.</font>

882
00:59:06,349 --> 00:59:07,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come have a drink.</font>

883
00:59:07,818 --> 00:59:09,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- <i>Now?</i>
- Right now.</font>

884
00:59:10,354 --> 00:59:11,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's late, Freddie.</font>

885
00:59:12,389 --> 00:59:13,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

886

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Please.</i></font>

887
00:59:14,992 --> 00:59:17,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Do you have something
to drink?</i></font>

888
00:59:17,727 --> 00:59:18,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suppose.</font>

889
00:59:18,963 --> 00:59:20,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Go get it.
Pour yourself something.</i></font>

890
00:59:20,997 --> 00:59:23,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Pour yourself a drink,
darling.</i></font>

891
00:59:24,934 --> 00:59:26,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have it?</font>

892
00:59:29,405 --> 00:59:31,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

893

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweetheart,
I want to throw a party.</font>

902
01:00:01,438 --> 01:00:03,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Okay.
Who do you want to invite?</i></font>

903
01:00:03,706 --> 01:00:04,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People.</font>

904
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to shake
the freak tree</font>

905
01:00:06,543 --> 01:00:08,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and invite anyone
who plops to the ground.</font>

906
01:00:08,845 --> 01:00:12,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dwarfs and giants...</font>

907
01:00:12,014 --> 01:00:16,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">magicians, Zulu tribesmen,
contortionists...</font>

908
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:18,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">fire eaters...</font>

909
01:00:18,822 --> 01:00:21,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and priests.</font>

910
01:00:21,157 --> 01:00:23,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to
need to confess.</font>

911
01:00:33,102 --> 01:00:34,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fill me up, will you, Trixie?</font>

912
01:00:34,805 --> 01:00:37,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marvelous, Fred!
You've outdone yourself!</font>

913
01:00:37,006 --> 01:00:39,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, John.
I'm so glad you love it!</font>

914
01:00:39,443 --> 01:00:42,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. They say money can't
buy happiness, darlings!</font>

915
01:00:42,445 --> 01:00:45,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it does allow you
to give it away!</font>

916
01:00:45,483 --> 01:00:47,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see you and Paul
are getting along quite well.</font>

917
01:00:47,684 --> 01:00:48,983

920
01:00:52,389 --> 01:00:55,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what's the sexiest part
of a car?</font>

921
01:01:02,633 --> 01:01:03,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

922
01:01:03,934 --> 01:01:05,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, well, well!</font>

923
01:01:05,602 --> 01:01:06,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, your majesty!</font>

924
01:01:06,803 --> 01:01:08,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm not her majesty!</font>

925
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're her majesty, darlings!</font>

926
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cheers!
- Cheers!</font>

927
01:01:15,144 --> 01:01:16,445

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Mary?</font>

930
01:01:19,582 --> 01:01:24,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not exactly
her scene, is it, Freddie?</font>

931
01:01:24,854 --> 01:01:26,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

932
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:28,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fabulous, isn't it?</font>

933
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:30,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you say so.</font>

934
01:01:33,796 --> 01:01:34,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

935
01:01:36,133 --> 01:01:38,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're starting to look
like each other.</font>

936
01:01:38,168 --> 01:01:39,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong with that,
Brian?</font>

937
01:01:39,436 --> 01:01:41,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're supposed to be
in a rock band, Freddie.</font>

938
01:01:41,171 --> 01:01:42,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not the Village People.</font>

939
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:45,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might want to think about
cutting your hair one day.</font>

940
01:01:45,843 --> 01:01:47,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never.
I was born like this.</font>

941
01:01:49,213 --> 01:01:51,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

942
01:01:52,548 --> 01:01:54,048

944
01:01:55,885 --> 01:01:57,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a few more
of these for that.</font>

945
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:00,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my party,
and I demand you dance!</font>

946
01:02:00,057 --> 01:02:01,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should go.</font>

947
01:02:01,224 --> 01:02:02,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By royal decree!</font>

948
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna go, actually.</font>

949
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:05,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God! You're dull.</font>

950
01:02:05,662 --> 01:02:08,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you were any more dull,
you'd be Deacy.</font>

951
01:02:08,264 --> 01:02:09,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you
complaining about?</font>

952
01:02:09,865 --> 01:02:11,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got your little pet.</font>

953
01:02:13,436 --> 01:02:14,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have...</font>

954
01:02:14,771 --> 01:02:16,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he's loyal.</font>

955
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loyalty's so important.
Don't you think, Dominique?</font>

956
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful, Fred.</font>

957
01:02:22,979 --> 01:02:24,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's go.
- Where you going?</font>

958
01:02:24,947 --> 01:02:26,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Home.</font>

959
01:02:26,082 --> 01:02:27,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a joke.</font>

960
01:02:27,416 --> 01:02:31,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie, sometimes
you're a total prick.</font>

961
01:02:31,354 --> 01:02:33,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good night.
- Brian.</font>

962
01:02:37,695 --> 01:02:38,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forget them.</font>

963
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:40,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!
Your guests are waiting.</font>

964
01:02:40,898 --> 01:02:43,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They all want a little
Mercury in their cup.</font>

965
01:02:43,432 --> 01:02:44,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

966
01:02:45,336 --> 01:02:46,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right!</font>

967
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:49,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My darlings...</font>

968
01:02:49,372 --> 01:02:51,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the time has finally come...</font>

969
01:02:51,842 --> 01:02:54,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to get absolutely...</font>

970
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:55,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shit-faced!</font>

971
01:03:00,851 --> 01:03:04,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

972
01:03:04,555 --> 01:03:07,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Senor, where's
my marching powder?</font>

973
01:03:31,347 --> 01:03:32,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got a set of balls.</font>

974
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:35,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go fetch me
a drink and find out.</font>

975
01:03:35,985 --> 01:03:37,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I may work
for you tonight...</font>

976
01:03:37,287 --> 01:03:39,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but put your hands on me
again, and I'll thump you.</font>

977
01:03:39,822 --> 01:03:41,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it?</font>

978
01:03:41,157 --> 01:03:43,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm terribly sorry.</font>

979
01:03:43,026 --> 01:03:45,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't mean to offend you.
I'm sorry.</font>

980
01:03:45,528 --> 01:03:47,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't do that again,
all right?</font>

981
01:03:51,034 --> 01:03:53,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me get you a beer.</font>

982
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:56,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't mind a beer.</font>

983
01:03:58,775 --> 01:04:01,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you just tell me where
we keep them?</font>

984
01:04:03,046 --> 01:04:05,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're very handsome.</font>

985
01:04:05,381 --> 01:04:07,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love a man in uniform.</font>

986
01:04:09,753 --> 01:04:11,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So do I.</font>

987
01:04:14,691 --> 01:04:17,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So, all your friends
have left you alone.</i></font>

988
01:04:17,026 --> 01:04:18,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not my friends.</font>

989
01:04:18,628 --> 01:04:19,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not really.</font>

990
01:04:20,597 --> 01:04:22,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just distraction.</font>

991
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:23,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From what?</font>

992
01:04:23,934 --> 01:04:26,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The in-between moments,
I suppose.</font>

993
01:04:28,104 --> 01:04:30,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I find them intolerable.</font>

994
01:04:30,707 --> 01:04:32,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of the...</font>

995
01:04:32,342 --> 01:04:37,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">darkness you thought you left
behind comes creeping back in.</font>

996
01:04:38,948 --> 01:04:40,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you mean.</font>

997
01:04:41,985 --> 01:04:43,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

998
01:04:45,387 --> 01:04:46,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it that
you do with them?</font>

999
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spend them
with real friends.</font>

1000
01:04:52,061 --> 01:04:54,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like
you could use a friend.</font>

1001
01:05:15,084 --> 01:05:16,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like you.</font>

1002
01:05:18,055 --> 01:05:19,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like you, too, Freddie.</font>

1003
01:05:22,791 --> 01:05:26,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come and find me when
you decide you like yourself.</font>

1004
01:05:32,903 --> 01:05:34,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I have
your name at least?</font>

1005
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Jim Hutton.</font>

1006
01:05:38,675 --> 01:05:40,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good night, Jim.
- Good night, Freddie.</font>

1007
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:42,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or should I say good morning?</font>

1008
01:05:46,517 --> 01:05:48,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want a new boat.</font>

1009
01:05:48,218 --> 01:05:49,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one is for me.
This one.</font>

1010
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:50,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't you say
we were going to see him?</font>

1011
01:05:50,954 --> 01:05:52,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I've got an hour left.
- Wait. What about this one?</font>

1012
01:05:52,588 --> 01:05:53,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I think
we'll still make that.</font>

1013
01:05:53,856 --> 01:05:54,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good size.</font>

1014
01:05:54,925 --> 01:05:56,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Screw him.</font>

1015
01:05:57,894 --> 01:05:59,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone up
on the drum risers!</font>

1016
01:06:00,463 --> 01:06:02,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Up on the drum risers.
- Come on!</font>

1017
01:06:02,532 --> 01:06:04,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Chrissie.
Showing some enthusiasm.</font>

1018
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wives and everyone, Brian?
- Me?</font>

1019
01:06:05,602 --> 01:06:06,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Come on, John. Everyone.</font>

1020
01:06:06,668 --> 01:06:08,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm not waiting any longer.
- Let's go.</font>

1021
01:06:08,905 --> 01:06:09,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up.</font>

1022
01:06:09,972 --> 01:06:11,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bass?
- No, you don't need it.</font>

1023
01:06:11,173 --> 01:06:12,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up.</font>

1024
01:06:12,476 --> 01:06:14,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, Rog, take your time.
- All right.</font>

1025
01:06:14,677 --> 01:06:15,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's this about?</font>

1026
01:06:15,912 --> 01:06:16,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You remember our last concert?</font>

1027
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The crowd were singing
our songs back to us.</font>

1028
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:22,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it was deafening,
but it was wonderful.</font>

1029
01:06:22,452 --> 01:06:24,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're becoming
a part of our show.</font>

1030
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to encourage that,
so...</font>

1031
01:06:26,423 --> 01:06:29,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got an idea to involve
them a little bit more.</font>

1032
01:06:29,093 --> 01:06:30,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's start with this.</font>

1033
01:06:32,729 --> 01:06:33,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stamp to this beat.</font>

1034
01:06:35,865 --> 01:06:36,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Genius.</font>

1035
01:06:37,334 --> 01:06:38,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, John.</font>

1036
01:06:39,802 --> 01:06:40,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1037
01:06:41,671 --> 01:06:43,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

1038
01:06:46,409 --> 01:06:49,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I want you to clap
on the third beat.</font>

1039
01:06:53,182 --> 01:06:54,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't speed up.</font>

1040
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:56,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rog, keep that time.</font>

1041
01:06:56,586 --> 01:06:59,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No Prenter?</font>

1042
01:06:59,256 --> 01:07:01,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's unusual to see you
without your clone.</font>

1043
01:07:01,157 --> 01:07:02,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's unusual seeing you
be so bitchy.</font>

1044
01:07:02,992 --> 01:07:04,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's usually me.</font>

1045
01:07:04,626 --> 01:07:06,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, you kept time, Rog.
Good.</font>

1046
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

1047
01:07:11,367 --> 01:07:13,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd know
if you were on time.</font>

1048
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:16,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a performer, darling,
not a Swiss train conductor.</font>

1049
01:07:19,943 --> 01:07:21,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry I'm late.</font>

1050
01:07:21,677 --> 01:07:22,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Again.</font>

1051
01:07:23,178 --> 01:07:24,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1052
01:07:24,247 --> 01:07:25,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, will you
please tell me</font>

1053
01:07:25,615 --> 01:07:27,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why you're not playing
any instruments?</font>

1054
01:07:27,217 --> 01:07:31,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna give the audience
a song that they can perform.</font>

1055
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:33,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right?
Let them be part of the band.</font>

1056
01:07:33,055 --> 01:07:34,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what can they do?</font>

1057
01:07:43,233 --> 01:07:44,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine...</font>

1058
01:07:44,601 --> 01:07:46,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thousands of people...</font>

1059
01:07:46,436 --> 01:07:48,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">doing this in unison.</font>

1060
01:07:48,671 --> 01:07:49,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1061
01:07:49,738 --> 01:07:50,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well?</font>

1062
01:07:51,474 --> 01:07:52,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the lyric?</font>

1063

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Buddy, you're a boy

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not explicitly.</font>

1101
01:10:18,021 --> 01:10:20,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we've had some interest
from CBS Records...</font>

1102
01:10:20,624 --> 01:10:22,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about a solo deal.</font>

1103
01:10:32,835 --> 01:10:34,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's a big number.</font>

1104
01:10:34,237 --> 01:10:36,337

- Oh, there you are.</font>

1112
01:10:50,853 --> 01:10:52,723

Put me down!</font>

1113
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:55,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were brilliant.</font>

1114
01:10:55,124 --> 01:10:57,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, that's only because
I knew you were watching.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my boyfriend, David.</font>

1119

<font face="Comic Sans MS">David, this is Freddie.</font>

1120
01:11:08,638 --> 01:11:10,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magnificent show.</font>

1121
01:11:11,073 --> 01:11:12,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1122

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's your ring?</font>

1125
01:11:24,219 --> 01:11:26,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just didn't want to travel
with something so valuable.</font>

1126
01:11:29,659 --> 01:11:32,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie, there are some people
here for you to see.</font>

1127
01:11:32,295 --> 01:11:33,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You promised you'd say hello.</font>

1128
01:11:35,866 --> 01:11:37,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, did I?
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

1129
01:11:39,702 --> 01:11:41,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should go.</font>

1130
01:11:41,137 --> 01:11:42,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will I see you soon?</font>

1131
01:11:43,473 --> 01:11:46,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, of course.
Of course.</font>

1132
01:11:47,911 --> 01:11:49,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mwah!</font>

1133
01:11:49,411 --> 01:11:51,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a pleasure to meet you,
David.</font>

1134

<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you.</font>

1135
01:11:52,348 --> 01:11:53,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And well done again.</font>

1136
01:11:54,517 --> 01:11:56,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you.</font>

1137
01:11:56,419 --> 01:11:57,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>

1138
01:11:59,055 --> 01:12:01,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for coming
such a long way.</font>

1139
01:12:01,523 --> 01:12:02,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>

1140
01:12:15,905 --> 01:12:18,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you've got
the MTV interview...</font>

1141
01:12:18,006 --> 01:12:22,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the plane to Houston
for the special.</font>

1142
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:23,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back here on Friday.</font>

1143
01:12:25,013 --> 01:12:27,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me now.</font>

1144
01:12:28,084 --> 01:12:30,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know who sold</font>

1145
01:12:30,018 --> 01:12:32,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4% of all the records
purchased last year?</font>

1146
01:12:32,656 --> 01:12:34,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Worldwide?</font>

1147
01:12:35,092 --> 01:12:36,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Michael Jackson.</font>

1148
01:12:36,759 --> 01:12:39,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not the Jackson 5.</font>

1149
01:12:39,028 --> 01:12:40,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Michael Jackson.</font>

1150
01:12:40,196 --> 01:12:43,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I think
you could do even better.</font>

1151
01:12:44,634 --> 01:12:47,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, I've had an offer
from CBS Records.</font>

1152
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:49,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a lot of money
for you, Fred,</font>

1153
01:12:49,138 --> 01:12:52,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I think
you should consider it.</font>

1154
01:12:55,644 --> 01:12:59,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you asking me
to break up the band?</font>

1155
01:12:59,182 --> 01:13:03,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just pointing out what
awaits you if you go solo.</font>

1156
01:13:03,887 --> 01:13:06,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An end to your
frustrations.</font>

1157
01:13:08,157 --> 01:13:09,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My frustrations?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Paul?</font>

1159
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what
you're talking about, John.</font>

1160
01:13:22,437 --> 01:13:23,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps I misunderstood.</font>

1161
01:13:23,839 --> 01:13:25,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yes, sir.</i></font>

1162
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:26,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull over.</font>

1163
01:13:26,675 --> 01:13:28,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop the car, pull over.</font>

1164
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:32,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get out. Out now!
- What the hell?</font>

1165
01:13:32,115 --> 01:13:33,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of this car.
You're fired.</font>

1166
01:13:33,517 --> 01:13:34,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What're you talking about,
fired?</font>

1167
01:13:34,584 --> 01:13:35,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said get out.</font>

1168
01:13:35,718 --> 01:13:37,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Freddie, you are high!
- I said get out!</font>

1169
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:38,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you
talking about?</font>

1170
01:13:38,653 --> 01:13:40,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out! Out or I'll kill you!</font>

1171
01:13:42,558 --> 01:13:44,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out,
you treacherous piss flap.</font>

1172
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not
thinking clearly.</font>

1173
01:13:46,027 --> 01:13:47,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your ass
out of my car now.</font>

1174
01:13:47,296 --> 01:13:48,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out!</font>

1175
01:13:49,098 --> 01:13:50,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out!</font>

1176
01:13:50,032 --> 01:13:52,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your ass out of my car!
Get out!</font>

1177
01:13:52,735 --> 01:13:55,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're firing the
wrong snake, Freddie.</font>

1178
01:13:55,204 --> 01:13:56,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll regret it.</font>

1179
01:13:56,673 --> 01:13:57,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your ass out of here!</font>

1180
01:14:00,043 --> 01:14:01,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drive!</font>

1181
01:14:02,045 --> 01:14:04,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! What the hell? Move!</font>

1182
01:14:04,214 --> 01:14:06,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, watch it!
I'll run your ass over!</font>

1183
01:14:06,883 --> 01:14:09,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move!</font>

1184
01:14:22,965 --> 01:14:25,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know
anything about this?</font>

1185
01:14:26,768 --> 01:14:28,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I warned him against it.</font>

1186
01:14:29,238 --> 01:14:30,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pure greed.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tried to break up
my family.</font>

1188
01:14:32,474 --> 01:14:34,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can manage the band.</font>

1189
01:14:34,309 --> 01:14:35,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't need him.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you know
about what I need?</font>

1191
01:14:40,282 --> 01:14:41,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what it's like...</font>

1192
01:14:41,851 --> 01:14:43,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not to belong.</font>

1193
01:14:43,652 --> 01:14:47,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A queer Catholic boy
from Belfast.</font>

1194

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know...</font>

1195
01:14:48,857 --> 01:14:52,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think my father
would rather see me dead...</font>

1196

1197
01:15:00,303 --> 01:15:02,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna take care
of you now, Freddie.</font>

1198
01:15:04,372 --> 01:15:05,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you'll let me.</font>

1199
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you reading?</font>

1200
01:15:19,222 --> 01:15:20,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just the cricket.</font>

1201
01:15:26,129 --> 01:15:28,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're a rock and roll band.</font>

1202
01:15:28,263 --> 01:15:29,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't do disco.</font>

1203
01:15:29,598 --> 01:15:31,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's not disco.
- Then what is it?</font>

1204
01:15:31,901 --> 01:15:32,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Queen.</font>

1205
01:15:33,001 --> 01:15:34,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So sorry, my darlings!</i></font>

1206

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Lost all track!</i></font>

1207
01:15:35,972 --> 01:15:37,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fired Reid
without consulting us!</font>

1208
01:15:37,941 --> 01:15:40,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't make decisions
for the band.</font>

1209
01:15:40,076 --> 01:15:41,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1210
01:15:42,312 --> 01:15:45,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm terribly sorry,
dear.</font>

1211
01:15:45,281 --> 01:15:46,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's done.</font>

1212
01:15:47,616 --> 01:15:48,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides...</font>

1213
01:15:48,851 --> 01:15:50,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miami will manage us.</font>

1214
01:15:50,786 --> 01:15:52,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Won't you, darling?</font>

1215
01:15:52,722 --> 01:15:54,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Erm... I'll think about it.</font>

1216
01:15:54,657 --> 01:15:56,556

01:27:48,336 --> 01:27:49,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just leave it.</font>

1482
01:27:49,403 --> 01:27:50,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yeah,
hang on one second.</i></font>

1483
01:27:51,741 --> 01:27:53,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give it more treble.</font>

1484
01:27:57,179 --> 01:27:59,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Where is he? Is he
there? I wanna speak to him.</i></font>

1485
01:27:59,447 --> 01:28:01,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is working himself
to the bone.</font>

1486
01:28:01,349 --> 01:28:03,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm blue in the face trying
to get him to take a break.</font>

1487
01:28:03,785 --> 01:28:04,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Paul, listen to me.</i></font>

1488
01:28:04,952 --> 01:28:06,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It's one performance
for a good cause.</i></font>

1489
01:28:06,921 --> 01:28:09,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a televised concert
for the famine in Ethiopia.</font>

1490
01:28:09,592 --> 01:28:11,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They're gonna have
simultaneous performances</i></font>

1491
01:28:11,326 --> 01:28:12,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in Philadelphia and London.</font>

1492
01:28:12,661 --> 01:28:14,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's gonna be
a billion people watching.</font>

1493
01:28:14,662 --> 01:28:15,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Queen should be part of it.</i></font>

1494
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:17,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He's just been
really focused.</i></font>

1495
01:28:17,098 --> 01:28:18,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But I'll be sure
to pass it on.</i></font>

1496
01:28:19,936 --> 01:28:21,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure you will.</font>

1497
01:29:25,534 --> 01:29:26,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1498
01:29:26,601 --> 01:29:29,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.
Come in, come in.</font>

1499
01:29:30,772 --> 01:29:32,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did you
come all this way?</font>

1500
01:29:32,875 --> 01:29:34,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just haven't heard
from you in so long,</font>

1501
01:29:34,643 --> 01:29:36,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I phoned and phoned,
and then...</font>

1502
01:29:36,678 --> 01:29:38,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">last night I just had
this terrible dream</font>

1503
01:29:38,147 --> 01:29:40,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that something bad
had happened.</font>

1504
01:29:40,616 --> 01:29:43,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.
I've been working, that's all.</font>

1505
01:29:43,117 --> 01:29:46,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie, you're burning
the candle at both ends.</font>

1506
01:29:46,487 --> 01:29:48,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but the glow
is so divine.</font>

1507
01:29:52,594 --> 01:29:54,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Being human
is a condition</font>

1508
01:29:54,028 --> 01:29:56,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that requires
a little anesthesia.</font>

1509
01:29:58,032 --> 01:30:00,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I miss you.
- I miss you.</font>

1510
01:30:00,236 --> 01:30:02,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I miss you so much.</font>

1511
01:30:02,137 --> 01:30:04,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, but I have to finish
the second album.</font>

1512
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:06,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you.</font>

1513
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:09,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay. Stay here with me.</font>

1514
01:30:09,644 --> 01:30:11,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just you and me.</font>

1515
01:30:12,546 --> 01:30:14,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need the love of my life.</font>

1516
01:30:18,454 --> 01:30:19,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie...</font>

1517
01:30:20,187 --> 01:30:21,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about Queen?</font>

1518
01:30:21,689 --> 01:30:22,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim told me he's been trying</font>

1519
01:30:22,957 --> 01:30:24,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to contact you
about Live Aid...</font>

1520
01:30:24,526 --> 01:30:26,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you won't
take his calls.</font>

1521
01:30:27,696 --> 01:30:29,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is Live Aid?</font>

1522
01:30:30,531 --> 01:30:31,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You haven't heard?</font>

1523
01:30:32,601 --> 01:30:33,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie,
it's the biggest concert</font>

1524
01:30:33,869 --> 01:30:36,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's ever been
or ever will be.</font>

1525
01:30:36,103 --> 01:30:37,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's for the famine
in Africa.</font>

1526
01:30:37,973 --> 01:30:40,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, perhaps Paul thought
it wasn't a good idea.</font>

1527
01:30:40,409 --> 01:30:41,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A distraction from my work.</font>

1528
01:30:41,777 --> 01:30:44,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what's important,
that I finish this album.</font>

1529
01:30:44,146 --> 01:30:46,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with me, darling,
and I'll be all right.</font>

1530
01:30:46,647 --> 01:30:47,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie,
I can't stay with you.</font>

1531
01:30:47,915 --> 01:30:50,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course you can.
I need you, Mary.</font>

1532
01:30:50,384 --> 01:30:52,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie, I'm pregnant.</font>

1533
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could you?</font>

1534
01:31:08,335 --> 01:31:10,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could I?</font>

1535
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie, this has nothing
to do with you.</font>

1536
01:31:13,508 --> 01:31:14,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Let's get in.</font>

1537
01:31:14,643 --> 01:31:16,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bought some nibbles.</font>

1538
01:31:16,311 --> 01:31:17,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie.</font>

1539
01:31:17,512 --> 01:31:19,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry we're late.</font>

1540
01:31:20,014 --> 01:31:21,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mary.</font>

1541
01:31:22,049 --> 01:31:24,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a pleasant surprise.</font>

1542
01:31:25,786 --> 01:31:28,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hans. Everyone, come in.</font>

1543
01:31:28,522 --> 01:31:30,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Milan,
make our guests comfortable.</font>

1544
01:31:33,228 --> 01:31:36,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish I knew
you were coming to stay.</font>

1545
01:31:36,365 --> 01:31:37,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd have scrubbed the place.</font>

1546
01:31:37,965 --> 01:31:39,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I'm not staying.</font>

1547
01:31:39,867 --> 01:31:42,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. Mary, wait. Don't go.</font>

1548
01:31:44,673 --> 01:31:46,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You told me
you had a dream.</font>

1549
01:31:47,843 --> 01:31:49,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was it?</font>

1550
01:31:50,512 --> 01:31:53,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was trying
to talk to you, but...</font>

1551
01:31:54,115 --> 01:31:56,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it was like
talking to my father.</font>

1552
01:31:56,617 --> 01:31:59,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You needed
to tell me something...</font>

1553
01:32:00,022 --> 01:32:01,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you couldn't say it.</font>

1554
01:32:03,457 --> 01:32:06,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you had no voice.</font>

1555
01:32:09,564 --> 01:32:12,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie, come and
say hello to our new guests.</font>

1556
01:32:12,934 --> 01:32:15,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're dying to meet you.</font>

1557
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:17,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll be one second.</font>

1558
01:32:19,174 --> 01:32:20,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mary!</font>

1559
01:32:31,018 --> 01:32:33,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm happy for you, Mary.</font>

1560
01:32:34,856 --> 01:32:36,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truly, I am.</font>

1561
01:32:41,362 --> 01:32:42,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just...</font>

1562
01:32:44,832 --> 01:32:46,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm frightened.</font>

1563
01:32:46,567 --> 01:32:49,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie,
you don't need to be.</font>

1564
01:32:49,237 --> 01:32:52,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because no matter what,
you are loved.</font>

1565
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:55,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By me, by Brian,
Deacy, Roger...</font>

1566
01:32:55,443 --> 01:32:57,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your family.</font>

1567
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:00,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's enough.</font>

1568
01:33:01,616 --> 01:33:03,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And these people...</font>

1569
01:33:03,985 --> 01:33:07,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they don't care about you.</font>

1570
01:33:07,022 --> 01:33:09,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Paul doesn't care about you.</font>

1571
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:13,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't belong here,
Freddie.</font>

1572
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:16,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come home.</font>

1573
01:33:21,303 --> 01:33:22,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Home.</font>

1574
01:33:46,294 --> 01:33:47,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddie!</font>

1575
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?
You'll catch your death.</font>

1576
01:33:54,803 --> 01:33:57,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you tell me
about Live Aid?</font>

1577
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:01,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Africa charity gig?</font>

1578
01:34:02,678 --> 01:34:04,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be an embarrassment.</font>

1579
01:34:04,646 --> 01:34:06,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't wanna
waste your time.</font>

1580
01:34:10,117 --> 01:34:11,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have told me.</font>

1581
01:34:11,952 --> 01:34:13,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I did.</font>

1582
01:34:14,255 --> 01:34:15,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You forgot.</font>

1583
01:34:15,323 --> 01:34:17,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're always
forgetting things.</font>

1584
01:34:17,959 --> 01:34:19,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come in now
and have a drink.</font>

1585
01:34:24,031 --> 01:34:25,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're out.</font>

1586
01:34:26,067 --> 01:34:27,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

1587
01:34:28,969 --> 01:34:31,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you out of my life.</font>

1588
01:34:34,842 --> 01:34:36,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I'm the only one left,</font>

1589
01:34:36,077 --> 01:34:37,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're blaming me
for everything?</font>

1590
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:40,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I blame myself.</font>

1591
01:34:41,849 --> 01:34:43,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'm out?</font>

1592
01:34:43,884 --> 01:34:45,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like that?</font>

1593
01:34:46,387 --> 01:34:48,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After everything
we've been through?</font>

1594
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:53,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just think of
the photos I have.</font>

1595
01:34:54,027 --> 01:34:56,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know who you are,
Freddie Mercury.</font>

1596
01:35:00,035 --> 01:35:03,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know when
you know you've gone rotten?</font>

1597
01:35:05,473 --> 01:35:06,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really rotten?</font>

1598
01:35:09,044 --> 01:35:10,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fruit flies.</font>

1599
01:35:11,646 --> 01:35:15,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dirty little fruit flies.</font>

1600
01:35:15,349 --> 01:35:18,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming to feast
on what's left.</font>

1601
01:35:18,219 --> 01:35:21,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there isn't much left
for you to feast on anymore.</font>

1602
01:35:23,991 --> 01:35:25,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, fly off.</font>

1603
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:29,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do what you like with your
photographs and your stories.</font>

1604
01:35:29,664 --> 01:35:32,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But promise me one thing.</font>

1605
01:35:33,434 --> 01:35:35,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That I never see
your face again.</font>

1606
01:35:36,938 --> 01:35:38,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever.</font>

1607
01:35:39,573 --> 01:35:40,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't mean it.</font>

1608
01:35:43,044 --> 01:35:45,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry!
Freddie, come back!</font>

1609
01:35:46,147 --> 01:35:48,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll make it better.</font>

1610
01:36:03,298 --> 01:36:04,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But, Peter,
you might be right.</i></font>

1611
01:36:04,799 --> 01:36:06,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm not even hurt</i></font>

1612
01:36:06,067 --> 01:36:07,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>by the fact that
he's let me go as a friend.</i></font>

1613
01:36:07,369 --> 01:36:10,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But you can only be there
so much for a person.</i></font>
