1
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Goal!</i></font>

2
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that? Ellie, did you hear that?</font>

3
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard it, Manny.
Whatever it is, it's miles away.</font>

4
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peaches, are you all right?</font>

5
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is she?</font>

6
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No teenager is ever up early.</font>

7
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy warden, she's not on lockdown.</font>

8
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two were supposed to be
responsible uncles!</font>

9
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? I didn't see Peaches sneak off
maybe 15 or 20 minutes ago.</font>

10
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or that she went with Louis to the falls.</font>

11
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The falls? Where the delinquents go?</font>

12
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax, it's just where the kids hang out.</font>

13
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, it's a gateway hangout.</font>

14
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First it's the falls,
then she's piercing her trunk...</font>

15
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the next thing you know,
she's addicted to berries.</font>

16
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny! You are overreacting.</font>

17
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not going to be
your little girl forever.</font>

18
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. That's what worries me.</font>

19
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

20
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Louis!</font>

21
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you get your head out of the ground
for once and try to have a little fun?</font>

22
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a molehog.
My head's supposed to be underground.</font>

23
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:32,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And my idea of fun isn't risking death
so that you can meet some cute mammoth.</font>

24
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan isn't cute. He's hot.</font>

25
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, you can't spend your whole life
playing it safe.</font>

26
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I know I would.
- Dad?</font>

27
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no reason to be mad.</font>

28
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know how I feel
about you going to the falls.</font>

29
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially alone.</font>

30
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not alone, sir.</font>

31
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't count, Weiner.</font>

32
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, there's my place,
and you just put me in it, thank you.</font>

33
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, young lady.</font>

34
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going home
where I can keep an eye on you.</font>

35
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:03,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, should I just wait here, or...</font>

36
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you don't scare me, Mother Nature!</font>

37
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing you can throw at me
that I can't handle.</font>

38
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we're almost there!</font>

39
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had better be! I just lost the steering.</font>

40
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has anyone seen Precious?
It's her feeding time.</font>

41
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom! Granny's talking about
her dead pet again.</font>

42
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, paws up, everybody!</font>

43
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Paws down, Uncle, please! That is nasty.</font>

44
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be careful, Milton,
you're going to hurt somebody!</font>

45
00:05:58,859 --> 00:05:59,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad kitty!</font>

46
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:00,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rock!</font>

47
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so tell me, when exactly
will I be allowed to hang out with boys?</font>

48
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:20,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I'm dead, plus 3 days.
Just to make sure I'm dead.</font>

49
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny, are you okay?</font>

50
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:45,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get off... my face!</font>

51
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:50,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was fun. Now, who should I eat first?</font>

52
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no!</font>

53
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncle Fungus! Could that really be you?</font>

54
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Sorry.</font>

55
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, Dad!</font>

56
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marshall!</font>

57
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey!
- Granny?</font>

58
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This pumpkin's ripe for picking!</font>

59
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My whole familia.</font>

60
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? He still hugs his parents.</font>

61
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:17,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never thought I'd see my little baby again.
We've been searching everywhere for you.</font>

62
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have?</font>

63
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it, I knew it!
Deep down, I knew I wasn't abandoned!</font>

64
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's incorrect. We totally abandoned you.</font>

65
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:30,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we always missed you. Right?</font>

66
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

67
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we just knew Sid
would want to see his poor, dear Granny...</font>

68
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before her time is up.</font>

69
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll bury you all and dance on your graves.</font>

70
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So frail.</font>

71
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she can't wait
to spend time with you, Sid.</font>

72
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, Granny? Granny?</font>

73
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Granny.
- I never get to have any fun.</font>

74
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you show her your cave?
Yeah, she could use a nap.</font>

75
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boy, there's so much to tell you.</font>

76
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot has happened
since the last time I saw you.</font>

77
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:07,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not interested.</font>

78
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we fought dinosaurs in the Ice Age.</font>

79
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It didn't make sense,
but it sure was exciting.</font>

80
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got rid of the crazy bat! Let's go!</font>

81
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't just leave.</font>

82
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sid will be crushed.</font>

83
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, cookie,
things are breaking apart back home.</font>

84
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we're headed inland.
And Granny is just dead weight.</font>

85
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- See you.
- Mush, mush!</font>

86
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:34,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And warn the community.
She tends to wander!</font>

87
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that explains a lot about Sid.</font>

88
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, Dad, do you have Granny's teeth?
She can't find them.</font>

89
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Can you chew this thing for me?</font>

90
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys'? Where is everyone?</font>

91
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll handle this.</font>

92
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sid?</font>

93
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your family was wiped out by an asteroid.
Sorry.</font>

94
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

95
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What Diego is trying to say is...</font>

96
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they left.</font>

97
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They only wanted to find you
so you could take care of Granny.</font>

98
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:13,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, what kind of sick family
would ditch their Granny on someone?</font>

99
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's just crazy. That's just...</font>

100
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's just...</font>

101
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...my family.</font>

102
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least you still have Granny.
Right, buddy?</font>

103
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Granny. Granny?</font>

104
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:28,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Granny?</font>

105
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. For an old girl, she moves fast.</font>

106
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Granny?
- Granny.</font>

107
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Granny?</font>

108
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come out, come out wherever you are!</font>

109
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Granny.</font>

110
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:46,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, Granny, Granny.
I have prunes for you!</font>

111
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just the way you like them!</font>

112
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to see that.</font>

113
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

114
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What if your dad finds out?
I'm not as tough as I look!</i></font>

115
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, do you hear that?</font>

116
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go long!</font>

117
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool!</font>

118
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, look, there's Ethan.</font>

119
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Ethan!</font>

120
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You go, boy!</font>

121
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was nice.</font>

122
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

123
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? Fun, no danger.</font>

124
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check me out!</font>

125
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sure he's fine.
- I'm completely not fine!</font>

126
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:51,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did not just do that! That was crazy!</font>

127
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice.</font>

128
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

129
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't he perfect?</font>

130
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Perfect." It's such a strong word.
Maybe "adequate."</font>

131
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:01,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are we stalking?</font>

132
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it Ethan? I bet it's Ethan.</font>

133
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Weiner.
- What are you guys doing here?</font>

134
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny told us to keep an eye on you.</font>

135
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But not to let you see us.
- Under any circumstances.</font>

136
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stupid, stupid, stupid.</font>

137
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'm going for it. Do I look okay?</font>

138
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Louis?</font>

139
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Okay" doesn't even begin to cover it.</font>

140
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Louis. You're the greatest friend ever!</font>

141
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's me.</font>

142
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Ethan, my name's Peaches.
What's yours'?</font>

143
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I doing?
Okay, just be cool, just be...</font>

144
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

145
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. That's intense!</font>

146
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This hurts so much!</font>

147
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No! No!</font>

148
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gross. It's that weirdo
who chills with possums!</font>

149
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What just happened?</font>

150
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no! Ethan, I am so sorry.</font>

151
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, you're even better-looking up close.</font>

152
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Phenomenal. I mean...</font>

153
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a twin sister?</font>

154
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I interrupting something?</font>

155
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad!
- Oh, boy. Okay...</font>

156
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:21,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, if I just...</font>

157
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait, no, you go left.
- Just move back a bit.</font>

158
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You! Keep away from my daughter.</font>

159
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad...
- And you, you're grounded!</font>

160
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But I didn't do...
- Grounded!</font>

161
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loser alert.</font>

162
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ouch, that's her dad.</font>

163
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously, that's embarrassing.</font>

164
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a freak.</font>

165
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peaches!</font>

166
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peaches, come on. Let's talk about this!</font>

167
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could you embarrass me
in front of my friends?</font>

168
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You deliberately went
where you weren't supposed to!</font>

169
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't control my life!</font>

170
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to protect you!
That's what fathers do.</font>

171
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well... I wish you weren't my father.</font>

172
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's just upset, honey.</font>

173
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peaches! It's not the end of the world.</font>

174
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. Excuse me.</font>

175
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think that was you.</font>

176
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What was that?
- I don't know.</font>

177
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay there.</font>

178
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll come to you.</font>

179
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ellie!
- Manny!</font>

180
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

181
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad!
- Peaches, get back!</font>

182
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry, Dad! Hurry!</font>

183
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny!</font>

184
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Diego!
- You never would have made it!</font>

185
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie, behind you!</font>

186
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happening?</font>

187
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to the land bridge!
You'll be safe on the other side.</font>

188
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Manny! No!</font>

189
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll meet you there!</font>

190
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny! No!</font>

191
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie, you have to get out of here!
Go! Go now!</font>

192
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom!
- Get back! Get back!</font>

193
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy!</font>

194
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay alive!</font>

195
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:36,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No matter how long it takes, I will find you!</font>

196
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, this is all my fault.
If I had just listened...</font>

197
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peaches! This is not your fault, okay?</font>

198
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if I never see him again?
And the last thing we did was fight.</font>

199
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:50,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, your father is the toughest,
most stubborn mammoth I've ever met.</font>

200
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll come back for us. That's a promise.</font>

201
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!
Help me turn this thing around!</font>

202
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:15,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone, please, settle down. Don't panic!</font>

203
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, Mom, where's Louis?
We have to find him.</font>

204
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, fast.</font>

205
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They need me! We got to get back.</font>

206
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buddy, this thing's too big to turn.
The current's pulling us out.</font>

207
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, my mother once told me that
bad news was just good news in disguise.</font>

208
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was this before she abandoned you?</font>

209
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it was.</font>

210
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:46,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the point being that,
even though things look bad...</font>

211
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's a rainbow around every corner...</font>

212
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:53,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and nothing but smooth sailing ahead!</font>

213
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smooth sailing, Sid?</font>

214
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Louis? Louis?
- Louis?</font>

215
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weiner! Weiner! Weiner!</font>

216
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Louis where are you'?
Come on, we have to go.</font>

217
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Louis?</font>

218
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peaches!</font>

219
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Louis, you have to jump.</font>

220
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! Go, save yourselves.</font>

221
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not leaving without you.</font>

222
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thank goodness.</font>

223
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jump!</font>

224
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is why I travel underground.</font>

225
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for coming back.</font>

226
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?
You don't leave a friend behind.</font>

227
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great, let's go.</font>

228
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That wall is going to keep moving
and crush us.</font>

229
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to get to the land bridge.</font>

230
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any questions?</font>

231
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>

232
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:11,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you drink water through your trunk,
does it taste like boogers?</font>

233
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

234
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, sometimes. Let's move!</font>

235
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just keep your eye on the horizon.</font>

236
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't find the horizon.</font>

237
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy crab!</font>

238
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold me.</font>

239
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I don't make it...</font>

240
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">find me a wife, and tell her I love her.</font>

241
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We made it!</font>

242
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:19,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, ocean,
is that the best you can do?</font>

243
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I right, buddy?</font>

244
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, there really is a rainbow
around every corner!</font>

245
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peaches!</font>

246
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

247
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just so worried about my dad.</font>

248
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, we're going to get to him.</font>

249
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At this pace, we'll stay ahead of the wall...</font>

250
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we'll make it to the land bridge
before you know it.</font>

251
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're all going to survive this.</font>

252
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, maybe they won't.
But everyone else, totally fine.</font>

253
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're still heading away from home.</font>

254
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but we survived,
and we still have each other.</font>

255
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things could be worse, right?</font>

256
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For once, he's actually right.</font>

257
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We made it through storms
and tidal waves...</font>

258
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a vicious assortment of seafood.</font>

259
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What more can they hit us with?</font>

260
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trying to make me get up
if I don't want to get up.</font>

261
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:10,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I want to get up I'd get up.</font>

262
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

263
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...?</font>

264
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dagnabbit, I'm trying to sleep!</font>

265
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Granny? You're alive!</font>

266
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And can we say
how thrilled we are to see you?</font>

267
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, fats, you want to get me out of here?</font>

268
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, come on.</font>

269
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretend I'm a dessert,
that should motivate you.</font>

270
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe this.
You slept through that storm?</font>

271
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I slept through the comet
that killed the unicorns.</font>

272
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for drawing my bath, Sidney.</font>

273
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Granny, grab my paw.
- No way.</font>

274
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my first bath in decades.</font>

275
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's your proof.</font>

276
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quick! Somebody do something!</font>

277
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got you, Granny.
- Get off of me!</font>

278
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Granny!</font>

279
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you peeping toms all looking at?</font>

280
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lady can't take a bath in peace?
Eyeballing me like a rump roast.</font>

281
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the life expectancy
for a female sloth?</font>

282
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll outlive us all, you know that, right?</font>

283
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, the spiteful ones live the longest.</font>

284

<font face="Comic Sans MS">How big is this ocean?</font>

285
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Water, water, everywhere</i></font>

286
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Nor any drop to drink</i></font>

287
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, except maybe that drop.</font>

288
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a little... salty.</font>

289
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:58,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Precious! Mommy's calling you.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Precious! Come here, sweetie.</font>

291
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, lady, have you seen Precious?</font>

292
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you mean the imaginary,
or perhaps deceased, pet...</font>

293
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you keep searching for, no, I haven't.</font>

294
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, look.</font>

295
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where there's birds, there's land, right?</font>

296
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, buddy, come here.</font>

297
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, wait, wait! Come back.</font>

298
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come back!</font>

299
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a huge bounty, mon capitaine.</font>

300
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:40,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 passengers. Ripe for the taking.</font>

301
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One very smelly, and one very plump.</font>

302
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my ocean?</font>

303
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a terrible turn of events.</font>

304
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love a terrible turn of events.</font>

305
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I hallucinating,
or is that ice coming straight towards us?</font>

306
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:09,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, it's coming.
It sounds like there's animals on it.</font>

307
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yippee!
We're being rescued, we're being rescued!</font>

308
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear laughter.</font>

309
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must be a party cruise.</font>

310
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, they look fluffy.</font>

311
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get the big woolly one.</font>

312
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

313
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get ready to slice and dice, boys.</font>

314
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Knock it off, Squint.
- Hey!</font>

315
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait for Captain's orders.</font>

316
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahoy, down there!</font>

317
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How lucky are you?</font>

318
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know these waters
are infested with pirates.</font>

319
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, boys?</font>

320
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Glad we found you before they did.</font>

321
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Gutt, here to help.</font>

322
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, that's a nice monkey.</font>

323
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, we don't want any trouble.
We just need to get back to the continent.</font>

324
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:30,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The continent? That pile of rubble?</font>

325
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My family's there, so if you could just...</font>

326
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:39,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your family? That is so sweet.</font>

327
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:43,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you said goodbye,
because there's no way back.</font>

328
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:47,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, there is.
Don't you remember, Captain?</font>

329
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can sail to Switchback Cove
and catch the current back from there.</font>

330
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a steel trap, this noggin is.</font>

331
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Mister Flynn.</font>

332
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? I knew there was a way home.</font>

333
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no home!</font>

334
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is only here.</font>

335
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:08,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And here, your ship belongs to me.</font>

336
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Battle stations!</font>

337
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fly the colors!</font>

338
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:25,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now surrender your ship or face my fury.</font>

339
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or face your furry what?</font>

340
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not "furry." Fury!</font>

341
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire!</font>

342
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hit the mammoth, win a prize.</font>

343
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ding, ding, ding-</font>

344
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire the starboard cannons.</font>

345
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love this job!</font>

346
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shira, fetch.</font>

347
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aye-aye, Captain.</font>

348
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You almost made it.</font>

349
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't fight girls.</font>

350
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see why.</font>

351
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Belly flop.</font>

352
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sid!</font>

353
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's rumba, Tiny.</font>

354
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lights out, big fella.</font>

355

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, buddy.</font>

358
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to the party.</font>

359
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see what kind of moves you got.
Dance, little Scrat fish!</font>

360
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dance your coconuts off!</font>

361
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy dance.</font>

362
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at him.</font>

363
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my bootie? Has anyone seen it?</font>

364
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, it's right behind you.</font>

365
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where? Where's my bootie?</font>

366
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't see it.</font>

367
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all I can see.</font>

368
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:58,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a lovely vacation. Best I've ever had.</font>

369
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morning, sunshine.</font>

370
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:04,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me be the first
to extend the hand of friendship.</font>

372
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing gets by you, does it?</font>

373
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

374
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:14,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you're feeling lost, scared, confused.</font>

375
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow me to explain.</font>

376
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me out, boys.</font>

377
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain's going to sing a shanty!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, what about Shira?</font>

483
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What about her?
- Yeah, what about her?</font>

484

00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we saved you.</font>

496
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That makes you the punch line, kitty.</font>

497
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't call me "kitty."</font>

498
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I won't...</font>

499
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kitty.</font>

500
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If they kiss, I'm going to puke.</font>

501
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Wait, no.</font>

502
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we there yet?</font>

503
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think we're ever going to get there.</font>

504
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we should rest for a few hours.</font>

505
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

511
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I meant to do that.</font>

512
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen a mammoth sleep like that.</font>

513
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No, this just helps me think.</font>

514
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It gets blood to the old noggin
and away from the old... whatever.</font>

515
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, that's a little weird.</font>

516
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:26,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, how are you doing, you know,
with all of this?</font>

517
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly, a little scared.</font>

518
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, a lot scared.</font>

519
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything we knew is gone.</font>

520
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I was pretty scared, too.</font>

521
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:39,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, not scared, but, like, concerned.</font>

522
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want to walk with me tomorrow?</font>

523
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try and get our minds off all this stuff.</font>

524
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to walk with me?</font>

525
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did almost flatten me this morning.</font>

526
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:51,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I figure it can't
really go worse than that, right?</font>

527
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

528
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just one thing.</font>

529
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's totally no big deal, but
you might want to lose the molehog.</font>

530
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Louis? Yeah, sure, not a problem.</font>

531
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:06,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

532
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone looks happy.</font>

533
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ethan's great, isn't he?</font>

534
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby, I know you like this one...</font>

535
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:18,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but just don't let anyone change
who you are, okay?</font>

536
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

537
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You coming up?</font>

538
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm going to sleep
down here tonight.</font>

539
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

540
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Night, baby.</font>

541
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Night, Mom.</font>

542
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good night, Dad.</font>

543
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, chew this sandwich for me.</font>

544
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:57,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Granny, why didn't our family want us?
What's wrong with us?</font>

545
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They think we're screw-ups
and we can't do anything right.</font>

546
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a rat!</font>

547
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

548
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Screw up.
- Oh, Sid!</font>

549
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll never make it home on this thing.</font>

550
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:21,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you should have thought of that
before you capsized our berg, genius.</font>

551
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, trying to escape.</font>

552
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wimp!
- Whiner!</font>

553
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Crybaby!
- Land!</font>

554
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, land! Wait, what?</font>

555
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not her. There!</font>

556
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Land!</font>

557
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone paddle. Paddle!</font>

558
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Food! I missed you so much!</font>

559
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at me, I've wasted away.</font>

560
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, snack time is over.
We got to build a raft.</font>

561
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny.</font>

562
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, Shira must really hate building rafts.</font>

563
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go get her. She can help us get back.</font>

564
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shira!</font>

565
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:46,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotcha!</font>

566
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

567
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let go of me.</font>

568
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you think you're going?</font>

569
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:00,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

570
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Switchback Cove.</font>

571
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the way home.</font>

572
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

573
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You call this a ship you miserable runts?</font>

574
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you little runts. Get to work.</font>

575
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:17,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faster, you worthless, wormy
sons of sorry excuses...</font>

576
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for shark bait weevils!</font>

577
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did he say?
- I don't know.</font>

578
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now get this chunk of ice
seaworthy by sundown...</font>

579
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or I will keelhaul the lot of you!</font>

580
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what do you think?</font>

581
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two words, anger management.</font>

582
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm talking about the current.</font>

583
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diego's right. We found the way home.</font>

584
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's great.
Too bad we don't have a ship.</font>

585
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:46,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure we do. It's right there.</font>

586
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's a flawless plan.</font>

587
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to pirate a pirate ship
from pirates.</font>

00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It pains me to say this, but...</font>

589
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- our prisoner has a point.
- Yeah, well...</font>

590
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys. The trees have ears.</font>

591
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute,
maybe we can help each other.</font>

592
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, little fellas. Hey, come on out.</font>

593
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, it's okay.
We're not going to hurt you.</font>

594
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about you and us
against the pirates, huh?</font>

595
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got no idea what I'm saying, do you?</font>

596
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, ship, me want.</font>

597
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, nice try Jungle Jim.</font>

598
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead make fun. He got it.</font>

599
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

600
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I try?</font>

601
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, knock yourself out.</font>

602
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:56,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, watch this.</font>

603
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sick sloths sip broth, sick sloths sip broth.</font>

605
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That, they got?</font>

606
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yup, they're in.</font>

607
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great, we'll free your buddies
and we can all work together...</font>

608
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to kick a little pirate booty.</font>

609
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy, kitty. Water.</font>

610
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need it.</font>

611
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need anything from you.</font>

612
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine, die of thirst. That will really show me.</font>

613
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

614
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take it.</font>

615
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

616
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:18,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a way of saying "thank you"
that makes it sound like "drop dead."</font>

617
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a gift.</font>

618
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you're pretty soft, for a saber.</font>

619
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, I am not soft.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I made you another coral necklace.</font>

623
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He keeps losing them.</font>

624
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I think I'm starting to get
why you're not in a pack.</font>

625
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I chose to leave my pack, all right?</font>

626
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations, warrior princess.</font>

627
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So did I.</font>

628
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:46,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- What?</font>

629
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing, I just know how hard that is...</font>

630
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">walking away from everything you know.</font>

631
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, great, are we going to
braid each other's fur now?</font>

632
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Funny. Really funny.</font>

633
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I tell you the difference
between you and me?</font>

634
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't still be wearing that necklace?</font>

635
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we both
might have wanted out of pack life...</font>

636
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but at least I didn't trade
one pack for another.</font>

637
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got something more.</font>

638
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, what's that?</font>

639
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A herd.
- What's the difference?</font>

640
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have each other's backs.</font>

641
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gutt has my back. I'm his first mate.</font>

642
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Because I don't see Gutt
sending out any search parties for you.</font>

643
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:23,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, you won't beat him.</font>

644
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your big furry friend over there?</font>

645
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has no idea what he's up against.</font>

646
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but neither does Gutt.</font>

647
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unwind the binds,
don't let go until we're all on board.</font>

648
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:36,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we need precision timing
from everyone to get that ship.</font>

649
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Half-pint, you got your end covered, right?</font>

650
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to take that as a "yes." Diego?</font>

651
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll free his little friends.</font>

652
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:48,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sid and Granny?</font>

653
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Untie the ship, sir!</font>

654
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, unwind the vines,
and don't let go until we're all on board.</font>

655
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're relying on you, Sid. You got that?</font>

656
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir. Totally focused, sir.</font>

657
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:58,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry.</font>

658
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be easy since
we don't have to guard Shira anymore.</font>

659
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to move, now.</font>

660
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Squint, batten down the hatches.</font>

661
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raz, hoist the anchor.</font>

662
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, Gupta, fly the colors.</font>

663
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, Captain.</font>

664
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're setting sail for vengeance, lads.</font>

665
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love vengeance.</font>

666
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:22,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain!</font>

667
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shira! Oh, what a relief!</font>

668
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought we'd lost you.</font>

669
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The mammoth. He washed ashore with me.</font>

670
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? He's here?</font>

671
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you sink your fangs into him?
Did he beg for his life?</font>

672
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, the saber took me down.</font>

673
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a failure.</font>

674
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:46,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need warriors, and all I have
are kitty cats and bunny rabbits.</font>

675
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And a seal and a kangaroo.</font>

676
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You take the saber down, or you die trying.</font>

677
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No excuses.</font>

678
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Captain.</font>

679
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Squint.</font>

680
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aye, sir.</font>

681
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're first mate now.</font>

682
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of
cool with me, Captain.</font>

683
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:09,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out of my way, saber.
You answer to me now.</font>

684
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gutt, listen, he's coming for the...</font>

685
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab your weapons, mates!</font>

686
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not the spoon, Flynn.</font>

687
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:58,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me!</font>

688
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, let's do this.</font>

689
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me at him! Yeah!</font>

690
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, that's not necessary, really.</font>

691
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, too, yeah.</font>

692
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to the ship, don't screw up.
Get to the ship, don't screw up.</font>

693
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:22,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let go.</font>

694
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unwind the vines.</font>

695
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let... Oh, yummo!</font>

696
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sid, no! It's a lotus berry.</font>

697
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:33,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will paralyze you.</font>

698
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, please. I know my berries.</font>

699
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't...</font>

700
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">swallow.</font>

701
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:42,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, I'm fine.
If there's one thing I know, it's berries.</font>

702
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:45,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh!</font>

703
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, finally!</font>

704
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's the Easter Bunny now?</font>

705
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:30,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It worked, he bought it!
- Come on!</font>

706
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:31,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no!</font>

707
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been a diversion.</font>

708
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, I'm having a blast.</font>

709
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, pinhead, they're stealing my ship.</font>

710
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One thing, Sid. You couldn't do one thing?</font>

711
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at you.</font>

712
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:48,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sid, can you hear me?</font>

713
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye-bye.</font>

714
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say something, buddy.</font>

715
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get them!</font>

716
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

717
00:49:58,579 --> 00:49:59,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Ship!</font>

718
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, we've got to catch it
before it hits open water!</font>

719
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. All right, I'll hold you higher.</font>

720
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. Sorry.</font>

721
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say adieu, mammoth!</font>

722
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:16,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Adieu!</i></font>

723
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:17,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, buddy.</font>

724
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming, Sid.</font>

725
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you! I got you! I got you!</font>

726
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:47,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming for you, mammoth.</font>

727
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diego!</font>

728
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

729
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, move it!</font>

730
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you doing this?</font>

731
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't understand. I don't have a choice.</font>

732
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to live this way, Shira.</font>

733
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be safe with us.</font>

734
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We take care of each other.
- Diego!</font>

735
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't hold on much longer.</font>

736
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diego!</font>

737
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come with us.</font>

738
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come with me.</font>

739
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:50,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

740
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got your back.</font>

741
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:20,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So long, banana breath.
Thanks for the ship!</font>

742
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, he's gone forever!</font>

743
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! There he is.</font>

744
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shore leave is over.</font>

745
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your sorry carcasses on board now.</font>

746
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gutt, I can explain.</font>

747
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:18,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When this ends...</font>

748
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:22,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll have a tiger's skin hanging on my wall.</font>

749
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care whose.</font>

750
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:31,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That mammoth has taken my ship...</font>

751
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my bounty ...</font>

752
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now the loyalty of my crew.</font>

753
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will destroy him...</font>

754
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and everything he loves.</font>

755
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait for it. Wait for it.</font>

756
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was awesome.</font>

757
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:40,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I ask you guys something?</font>

758
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you both so happy?</font>

759
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't it weigh on you
that the world might be ending?</font>

760
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I tell him our secret?</font>

761
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here. Come here.</font>

762
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:54,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're very, very stupid.</font>

763
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, still, you're not a teensy bit
concerned about...</font>

764
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, say, imminent death?</font>

765
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beep.</font>

766
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to go find Peaches.</font>

767
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:17,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, over here. Come on, it's a shortcut.</font>

768
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:18,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to love this.</font>

769
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, girls, let's have some fun.</font>

770
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:22,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!</font>

771
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:25,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is so cool.
- It's like we're upside down.</font>

772
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is amazing.</font>

773
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:28,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Echo!</font>

774
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:37,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too bad your molehog friend
isn't here, huh'?</font>

775
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not really friends with him, are you?</font>

776
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, come clean, Peaches.</font>

777
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you friends
with that awkward little rodent or not?</font>

778
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean...</font>

779
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Louis and I, we've hung out or whatever.</font>

780
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, no, we're not really friends-friends.</font>

781
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not friends?</font>

782
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Louis! I...</font>

783
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Busted.</font>

784
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good to know.</font>

785
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Louis, wait.</font>

786
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:08,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He even runs away like a loser.</font>

787
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:12,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, Peaches, don't stress.
You're with us now.</font>

788
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:15,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yeah, stress is so stressful.</i></font>

789
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, girl, if you're going to stress
about something, stress about your hair.</font>

790
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, right?
This humidity, I can't stand it.</font>

791
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:28,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, we should get out of here.</font>

792
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding? This is epic!</font>

793
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Go! Go!</font>

794
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:41,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

795
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How sick was that?</font>

796
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yo, that was insane.</i></font>

797
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:49,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Peach, loosen up! Have some fun.</font>

798
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fun, you call that fun? I'm out of here.</font>

799
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, do you really want to go back...</font>

800
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:58,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to hanging with a weird molehog freak
and give all of this up?</font>

801
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it's bad enough
that your family is half possum and...</font>

802
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad enough?</font>

803
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:05,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is nothing bad
about being part of my family.</font>

804
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like hanging by my tail.</font>

805
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:11,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you geniuses are normal,
this species is going to end up extinct.</font>

806
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:15,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, your species
is going to be extinct first.</font>

807
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Burn!</font>

808
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're the same species, genius.</font>

809
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:21,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Double burn.</font>

810
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I can wiggle my toe again.</font>

811
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:47,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The important one,
the little piggy who went to market.</font>

812
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! I'm talking again.</font>

813
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:52,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had so many things
trapped inside of me that I couldn't say.</font>

935
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let go of me.</font>

936
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:50,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are the odds?</font>

937

<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let them go.</font>

952
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think so.</font>

953
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You destroyed everything I had.</font>

954
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just returning the favor.</font>

955
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:48,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

956
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:52,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I warned you.</font>

957
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:54,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

958
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:59,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let the mammoth go!</font>

959
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weiner?</font>

960
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who brought the muscle to the party?</font>

961
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:05,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Louis, don't!</font>

962
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's he doing?
He's going to get himself killed.</font>

963
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:10,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, I can handle him.</font>

964
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:13,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How cute, a hero.</font>

965
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:15,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see what bravery gets you.</font>

966
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gupta, give the lad your weapon.</font>

967
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice knowing you, kid.</font>

968
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's dance, hero.</font>

969
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:56,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't stand there like barnacles. Get him!</font>

970
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oi, going somewhere, mate?</font>

971
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me at him.</font>

972
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:14,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any last words?</font>

973
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Precious!</font>

974
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:18,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you stop with the "Precious"?</font>

975
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy.</font>

976
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I guess we showed them, huh?</font>

977
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Precious!
- That's your pet?</font>

978
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:36,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe that crazy old bat
isn't that crazy after all.</font>

979
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:41,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope, she's nuts.</font>

980
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:44,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You waiting for a formal invitation,
fancy pants?</font>

981
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:45,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in.</font>

982
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:47,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to regret this.</font>

983
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bombs away!</font>

984
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be a scaredy cat.</font>

985
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:09,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This smells worse than me.</font>

986
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Precious, set your flippers
45 degrees north.</font>

987
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Granny's done running.</font>

988
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:15,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back off.</font>

989
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, I'm on your side.</font>

990
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:20,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you were a traitor.</font>

991
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:24,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your little bunny nose wiggles
in the cutest way when you're mad.</font>

992
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:26,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

993
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your 9 lives are over, kitty.</font>

994
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:29,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Silly rabbit...</font>

995
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">piracy doesn't pay.</font>

996
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, that's not cool. Come on, now.</font>

997
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:41,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone have a body wipe?</font>

998
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:44,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suck it up, buttercup. How's it looking?</font>

999
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:48,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not good, Granny sir.</font>

1000
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:50,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Full speed ahead!</font>

1001
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dive, dive, dive!</font>

1002
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:01,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire!</font>

1003
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Booyah, baby!</font>

1004
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:11,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This feels so good!</font>

1005
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Mister Whale.</font>

1006
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi, Manny.
- Sid!</font>

1007
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>

1008
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:21,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom!</font>

1009
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Peaches, I'll get your mother.
You stay there.</font>

1010
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry, Manny.</font>

1011
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Payback time.</font>

1012
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:33,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny!</font>

1013
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:36,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ellie!
- I got this, Dad.</font>

1014
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peaches, no! It's too dangerous!</font>

1015
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not if you're half-possum!</font>

1016
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:58,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She did it.</font>

1017
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My daughter's all grown up.</font>

1018
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my girl.</font>

1019
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to get out of here.</font>

1020
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, I'm right behind you.</font>

1021
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:14,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1022
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm right behind you.</font>

1023
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:18,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

1024
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:28,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1025
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nowhere to run, Manny.</font>

1026
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:48,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, this ocean
isn't big enough for the both of us.</font>

1027
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:50,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry...</font>

1028
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:53,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you won't take up much space
once I flatten you.</font>

1029
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you, tubby...</font>

1030
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:12,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you shouldn't have messed
with the Master of the Seas.</font>

1031
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:16,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, sometimes,
it pays to weigh 11 tons!</font>

1032
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:18,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1033
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bon voyage, monkey boy!</font>

1034
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did somebody hail a whale?</font>

1035
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:39,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you must be Precious.</font>

1036
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mission accomplished, Granny.</font>

1037
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who says old ladies can't drive?</font>

1038
01:12:55,997 --> 01:13:00,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Captain Gutt!</font>

1039
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's me!</font>

1040
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:05,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's rule the seas together.</font>

1041
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ave, aye.</font>

1042
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:22,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

1043
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's that for an entrance?</font>

1044
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

1045
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny.</font>

1046
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:40,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you
your father would never give up on us.</font>

1047
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never.</font>

1048
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I actually...</font>

1049
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:52,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Sid...</font>

1050
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:53,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're not such a screw-up.</font>

1051
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- Really.</font>

1052
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:57,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a hero.</font>

1053
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:00,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You too, Granny.</font>

1054
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, lady.</font>

1055
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, still want me
on your scurvy crew?</font>

1056
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bet.
Welcome to our herd.</font>

1057
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:11,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you.</font>

1058
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:14,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe you did that for me.</font>

1059
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1060
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone once told me,
no matter what...</font>

1061
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:20,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you never leave a friend behind.</font>

1062
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:24,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All this sweetness
is going to rot my teeth.</font>

1063
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I had any.</font>

1064
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:33,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our home is gone.</font>

1065
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:35,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do we go now?</font>

1066
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Momma loves you, too!</font>

1067
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't wait to check this place out.
- Yeah.</font>

1068
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:31,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me?
- Dad!</font>

1069
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:35,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you two get off this ship,
I expect you both to...</font>

1070
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have fun.</font>

1071
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a brave kid, Weiner.</font>

1072
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:40,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, what?</font>

1073
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You heard me.
You two should go out and explore.</font>

1074
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go where the day takes you.</font>

1075
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But be back before sunset.</font>

1076
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An hour after sunset?</font>

1077
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:52,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, not a minute later.</font>

1078
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deal.</font>

1079
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, Dad.</font>

1080
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:03,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay if we hang with you guys?</font>

1081
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:04,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

1082
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always liked him.</font>

1083
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:09,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Louis the hero.
Brave-a-licious.</font>

1084
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:13,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not my little girl anymore.</font>

1085
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:15,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're both going to be just fine.</font>

1086
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:17,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1087
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:22,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Sidney?
You've got yourself a nice family, here.</font>

1088
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:24,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A real family.</font>

1089
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:27,667
