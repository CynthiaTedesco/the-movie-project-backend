1
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:24,539
Peter.

2
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:31,742
You could not watch
even one hour with me?

3
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:36,183
- Master, what has happened to you?
- Should I call the others, Lord?

4
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:40,156
No, John. I don't want
them to see me like this.

5
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:43,090
Are you in danger?
Should we flee, Master?

6
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:46,562
Stay here. Watch...

7
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:50,200
pray.

8
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:07,012
What is wrong with him?

9
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:09,609
He seems afraid.

10
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:13,748
He had spoken about
danger while we ate...

11
00:03:13,892 --> 00:03:16,452
He mentioned betrayal and...

12
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:39,381
30.

13
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:41,349
30, Judas.

14
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:45,980
That was the agreement between me...
and you?

15
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,008
Yes.

16
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:34,864
Where?

17
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:37,966
Where is he?

18
00:05:11,943 --> 00:05:15,071
Hear me, Father.

19
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:21,949
Rise up, defend me.

20
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:32,091
Save me from the traps
they set for me.

21
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:56,176
Do you really believe...

22
00:05:56,354 --> 00:06:03,021
that one man can bear
the full burden of sin?

23
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:06,387
Shelter me, O Lord.

24
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,459
I trust in you.

25
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:16,702
In you I take refuge.

26
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:28,448
No one man can carry
this burden, I tell you.

27
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,714
It is far too heavy.

28
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:35,758
Saving their souls
is too costly.

29
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:40,563
No one. Ever.

30
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:44,024
No.

31
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:46,035
Never.

32
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:52,306
Father, you can do all things.

33
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:59,273
If it is possible, let this
chalice pass from me...

34
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:10,225
But let your will be done...
not mine.

35
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:39,248
Who is your father?

36
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,994
Who are you?

37
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:49,820
Who are you looking for?

38
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,884
We're looking for
Jesus of Nazareth.

39
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,932
I am he.

40
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:33,563
Hail, Rabbi!

41
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,509
Judas...

42
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:53,347
you betray the Son
of Man with a kiss?

43
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:55,763
Peter!

44
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:59,270
Put it down!

45
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:04,713
Those who live by the sword
shall die by the sword.

46
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,521
Put it down.

47
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,518
Malchus! Get up!

48
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:53,858
We've got him. Let's go!

49
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:15,948
What, Mary? What is it?

50
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,852
Listen...

51
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:31,460
'Why is this night different
from every other night?'

52
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:40,566
'Because once we were slaves and
we are slaves no longer...'

53
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:53,181
They've seized him!

54
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,310
Everyone you can, hear? To the
courtyard of the High Priest.

55
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:29,510
Quick! Go!

56
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:01,377
Halt! Not so fast.

57
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,838
This is not your party,
you toothless vermin.

58
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:12,481
Peter...

59
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:18,322
Peter...

60
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:27,464
Hey! What's going on here?

61
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:30,101
In there! Stop them!

62
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:32,674
They've arrested him!

63
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,608
In secret! In the night!

64
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:38,113
To hide their crime from you!

65
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:39,716
Stop them!

66
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,546
What are you yelling
about, woman?

67
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:45,416
Who have they arrested?

68
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:47,252
Jesus.

69
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:48,825
Jesus of Nazareth!

70
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:50,086
Shut up!

71
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:53,494
Shut up!

72
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:59,231
She's crazy.

73
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:04,433
A criminal. Brought in for
questioning, that's all.

74
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:08,601
Broke the temple laws.

75
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:18,587
I see...

76
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:23,717
Better go tell him there's
more trouble brewing.

77
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:26,261
Tell who?

78
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:28,592
Abenader, you idiot.

79
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:31,395
Get going!

80
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:34,036
Go!

81
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:18,372
Jesus...

82
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:22,208
Jesus...

83
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:37,457
Are you hungry?

84
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:40,736
Yes, I am.

85
00:20:48,946 --> 00:20:52,109
This is certainly a tall table!

86
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:56,151
- Who is it for?
- A rich man.

87
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:02,724
Does he like to eat standing up?

88
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:05,961
No. He prefers to eat like...
so.

89
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:11,265
Tall table, tall chairs!

90
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:14,262
Well, I haven't made them yet.

91
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:32,947
This will never catch on!

92
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,923
Oh, no you don't!

93
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,461
Take off that dirty apron
before you come in.

94
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:45,494
And wash your hands.

95
00:22:11,462 --> 00:22:14,022
It has begun, Lord.

96
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:20,503
So be it.

97
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:52,062
Sir, there's trouble at...

98
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:54,729
What, in the middle of
the night, Abenader?

99
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:56,134
I'm sorry.

100
00:22:56,273 --> 00:22:57,706
What's the problem?

101
00:22:57,808 --> 00:22:59,708
Trouble within the walls.

102
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:03,278
Caiphas had some
prophet arrested.

103
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:05,041
Who?

104
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:07,049
Some Galilean.

105
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:09,642
The Pharisees apparently
hate the man.

106
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:13,348
A Galilean? Who are
you talking about?

107
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:16,755
Who is this beggar
you bring to us?

108
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:20,959
Chained up like a condemned man.

109
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:24,693
He's Jesus, the
Nazarene troublemaker.

110
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,529
You're Jesus of Nazareth?

111
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,467
They say you're a king.

112
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:35,704
Where is this kingdom of yours?

113
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:38,713
What line of kings
do you descend from?

114
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:41,249
Speak up!

115
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:45,321
You're just the son of some
obscure carpenter, no?

116
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:50,185
Some say you're Elijah.

117
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:53,319
But he was carried off
to heaven in a chariot!

118
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:57,865
Why don't you say something?

119
00:23:57,968 --> 00:24:03,065
You've been brought
here as a blasphemer!

120
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:06,237
What do you say to that?

121
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:08,834
Defend yourself.

122
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:16,847
I have spoken
openly to everyone.

123
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:24,426
I've taught in the temple
where we all gather.

124
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:27,861
Ask those who have heard
what I have to say.

125
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:32,129
Is that how you address
the high priest?

126
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:35,537
With arrogance?

127
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:50,645
If I have spoken evil...

128
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:53,882
tell me what evil I have said.

129
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:58,923
But if not, why do you hit me?

130
00:25:01,532 --> 00:25:05,093
Yes, we'll listen to those
who heard your blasphemies.

131
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:07,100
Good!

132
00:25:08,939 --> 00:25:11,669
Let's hear them.

133
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:14,903
He cures the sick by magic!

134
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:18,346
With the help of devils!

135
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:21,807
I've seen it.

136
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:28,324
He casts out devils,
with the help of devils.

137
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:36,930
He calls himself the
king of the Jews!

138
00:25:38,902 --> 00:25:42,269
No, he calls himself
the son of God!

139
00:25:42,372 --> 00:25:46,308
He said he would
destroy the temple...

140
00:25:46,443 --> 00:25:49,674
and rebuild it in three days!

141
00:25:50,747 --> 00:25:53,944
Worse!

142
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:57,076
He claims he's the
bread of life!

143
00:25:57,187 --> 00:26:02,124
And if we don't eat his
flesh or drink his blood...

144
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:04,989
we won't inherit eternal life.

145
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:07,694
Silence!

146
00:26:08,832 --> 00:26:11,858
You're all under
this man's spell.

147
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:17,803
Either offer proof
of his wrongdoing...

148
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:21,537
or be quiet!

149
00:26:21,678 --> 00:26:26,945
This entire proceeding
is an outrage.

150
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:31,316
All I've heard from these witnesses
is mindless contradiction!

151
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,791
Who called this meeting anyway?

152
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:47,962
And at this hour of the night?

153
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:51,734
Where are the other
members of the council?

154
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,537
Get him out of here!

155
00:26:56,446 --> 00:26:58,038
Get out!

156
00:26:58,181 --> 00:27:02,117
A travesty! That's what this
is, a beastly travesty!

157
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:13,588
Haven't you anything to say?

158
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,221
No answer to these accusations?

159
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:22,131
I ask you now...

160
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:26,007
Jesus of Nazareth...

161
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:30,808
Tell us, are you the Messiah?

162
00:27:31,848 --> 00:27:37,878
The son of the living God?

163
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:50,633
I AM...

164
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:54,932
and you will see the Son of Man
seated at the right hand of power...

165
00:27:55,072 --> 00:27:57,472
and coming on the
clouds of heaven.

166
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:04,613
Blasphemy!

167
00:28:05,615 --> 00:28:12,418
Blasphemy! You heard him.
There's no need for witnesses!

168
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:19,219
Your verdict.
What is your verdict?

169
00:28:20,397 --> 00:28:22,797
Death!

170
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:19,414
Haven't I seen you in the
company of the Galilean?

171
00:29:19,523 --> 00:29:22,458
Yes! You're one
of his disciples!

172
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:24,924
I recognize you!

173
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:28,259
Quiet! I've never met the man.
I don't know him.

174
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:31,629
You are Peter! One of
the disciples of Jesus.

175
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:39,739
I don't know the man!
You are wrong!

176
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,738
Stop! Stop!

177
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:43,812
I've seen you before!

178
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:45,814
Stop him! He's one of them!

179
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:51,712
You're wrong, damn you!

180
00:29:51,855 --> 00:29:55,518
I swear I don't know the man.

181
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:59,060
I've never seen him before.

182
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:14,570
Wherever you go,
Lord, I will follow.

183
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,481
To prison, even to death.

184
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:27,481
Amen, I say to you...

185
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:32,684
before the cock crows...

186
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:38,859
three times you will deny me.

187
00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:04,251
Peter?

188
00:31:19,075 --> 00:31:22,841
No, no... I am unworthy!

189
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,509
I have denied him, Mother!

190
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:32,318
Denied him three times.

191
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:48,670
Let's go! You take care of it.

192
00:31:52,108 --> 00:31:55,509
Let him pass. He's harmless.

193
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,273
Release him!

194
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:02,708
Take back the silver.

195
00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:04,444
Here!

196
00:32:06,856 --> 00:32:10,417
I've sinned, betrayed
innocent blood.

197
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:17,866
Take back your silver.
I don't want it!

198
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:23,634
If you think you've betrayed
innocent blood, that's your affair.

199
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:26,941
Take your money and go.

200
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:29,036
Now go!

201
00:32:55,972 --> 00:32:58,406
What's wrong? Are you all right?

202
00:32:58,575 --> 00:33:00,941
Look at his mouth. Hey,
can we look at it?

203
00:33:01,077 --> 00:33:03,409
You need help? Can we help?

204
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:05,606
He's bleeding! Look! Blood!

205
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:11,743
Leave me alone...

206
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:14,656
you little satans!

207
00:33:15,091 --> 00:33:17,889
Aha! Cursing! Are you cursed?

208
00:33:18,061 --> 00:33:22,122
- He's cursed!
- Yes, a curse! It's inside him, look!

209
00:33:34,778 --> 00:33:38,111
Watch out, it's like burning
oil from his bones!

210
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:46,453
Get away from me!
Leave me alone!

211
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:08,476
Don't condemn this Galilean.

212
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:10,677
He's holy.

213
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,411
You will only bring
trouble on yourself.

214
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:16,651
Do you want to know my
idea of trouble, Claudia?

215
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:21,160
This stinking outpost, that
filthy rabble out there.

216
00:39:04,474 --> 00:39:07,910
Do you always punish your
prisoners before they're judged?

217
00:39:08,044 --> 00:39:09,170
Governor...

218
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:12,270
What accusations do you
bring against this man?

219
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:15,073
Well...

220
00:39:15,218 --> 00:39:19,587
if he weren't a malefactor, we
wouldn't have brought him before you.

221
00:39:19,689 --> 00:39:22,214
That's not what I asked.

222
00:39:22,325 --> 00:39:26,022
Why don't you judge him
according to your own laws?

223
00:39:26,129 --> 00:39:32,398
Consul, you know it's unlawful for
us to condemn any man to death.

224
00:39:33,202 --> 00:39:34,726
To death?

225
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:38,307
What has this man done
to merit such a penalty?

226
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:41,604
He has violated our
Sabbath, Consul.

227
00:39:42,545 --> 00:39:44,035
Go on...

228
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:46,047
He has seduced the people...

229
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:49,516
taught foul,
disgusting doctrines.

230
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,056
Isn't he the prophet you welcomed
into Jerusalem only five days ago?

231
00:39:55,158 --> 00:39:59,959
And now you want him dead? Can any
of you explain this madness to me?

232
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,029
Your Excellency...

233
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:12,437
Your Excellency, please...

234
00:40:13,342 --> 00:40:18,143
So far the high priest hasn't told
you this man's greatest crime.

235
00:40:19,315 --> 00:40:24,343
He has become the leader of
a large and dangerous sect

236
00:40:24,454 --> 00:40:27,014
who hail him as
the Son of David!

237
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:31,924
He claims that he
is the Messiah.

238
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:34,791
The king promised to the Jews.

239
00:40:35,898 --> 00:40:41,131
He has forbidden his followers to
pay tribute to the emperor, Consul!

240
00:40:48,111 --> 00:40:50,477
Bring him here!

241
00:41:21,544 --> 00:41:23,444
Go!

242
00:41:28,317 --> 00:41:29,579
Drink.

243
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:46,557
Are you the king of the Jews?

244
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:51,597
Does this question
come from you?

245
00:41:51,774 --> 00:41:57,804
Or do you ask me this because others
have told you that is what I am?

246
00:41:57,947 --> 00:42:02,281
Why would I ask you that?

247
00:42:02,385 --> 00:42:04,216
Am I a Jew?

248
00:42:04,353 --> 00:42:10,019
Your high priests, your own
people delivered you up to me.

249
00:42:10,126 --> 00:42:14,290
They want me to have you executed.
Why? What have you done?

250
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:20,161
Are you a king?

251
00:42:23,172 --> 00:42:26,573
My kingdom is not of this world.

252
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:33,239
If it were, do you think my followers
would have let them hand me over?

253
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:35,977
Then you are a king?

254
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:42,248
That is why I was born.

255
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:44,952
To give testimony to the truth.

256
00:42:45,094 --> 00:42:50,999
All men who hear the
truth hear my voice.

257
00:42:52,602 --> 00:42:54,797
Truth!

258
00:42:58,007 --> 00:43:00,532
What is truth?

259
00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:30,633
I have questioned this prisoner,
and I find no 'cause in him.

260
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:44,280
This man is a
Galilean, is he not?

261
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:45,854
He is.

262
00:43:45,988 --> 00:43:49,116
Then he is King Herod's subject.

263
00:43:49,258 --> 00:43:50,748
Let Herod judge him.

264
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:54,260
- Governor...
- Hand him over.

265
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:19,151
Jesus of Nazareth!

266
00:44:19,288 --> 00:44:21,347
Where?

267
00:44:25,561 --> 00:44:27,654
Where is he?

268
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:36,163
This...

269
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:38,570
is Jesus of Nazareth?

270
00:44:44,647 --> 00:44:47,912
Is it true that you restore
sight to the blind?

271
00:44:51,487 --> 00:44:54,320
Raise men from the dead?

272
00:45:10,406 --> 00:45:14,137
Where do you get your power?

273
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:26,916
Are you the one whose
birth was foretold?

274
00:45:32,428 --> 00:45:35,090
Answer me!

275
00:45:35,231 --> 00:45:37,665
Are you a king?

276
00:45:41,437 --> 00:45:48,275
How about me? Will you work
a little miracle for me?

277
00:46:04,193 --> 00:46:08,061
Take this stupid fool
out of my sight.

278
00:46:08,197 --> 00:46:11,633
He's not guilty of a
crime, he's just crazy.

279
00:46:13,402 --> 00:46:17,031
Give him a fool's homage...

280
00:46:39,095 --> 00:46:41,154
What is truth, Claudia?

281
00:46:41,297 --> 00:46:47,167
Do you hear it, recognize
it when it is spoken?

282
00:46:47,303 --> 00:46:50,067
Yes, I do.

283
00:46:51,974 --> 00:46:53,100
Don't you?

284
00:46:53,242 --> 00:46:55,301
How?

285
00:46:55,478 --> 00:46:57,639
Can you tell me?

286
00:47:06,622 --> 00:47:12,083
If you will not hear the
truth, no one can tell you.

287
00:47:13,129 --> 00:47:15,222
Truth...

288
00:47:16,632 --> 00:47:20,932
Do you want to know what
my truth is, Claudia?

289
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:26,804
I've been putting down rebellions in
this rotten outpost for eleven years.

290
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:33,007
If I don't condemn this man, I know
Caiphas will start a rebellion.

291
00:47:33,115 --> 00:47:37,142
If I do condemn him,
then his followers may.

292
00:47:37,286 --> 00:47:40,687
Either way, there
will be bloodshed.

293
00:47:40,823 --> 00:47:44,623
Caesar has warned me, Claudia.
Warned me twice.

294
00:47:44,727 --> 00:47:48,424
He swore that the next time
the blood would be mine.

295
00:47:48,531 --> 00:47:50,829
That is my truth!

296
00:47:55,771 --> 00:48:01,175
Herod refuses to condemn the man.
They're bringing him back here.

297
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,835
We're going to need
reinforcements.

298
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:06,413
I don't want to
'cause an uprising.

299
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:09,915
There is already an uprising.

300
00:48:35,678 --> 00:48:39,546
King Herod found no
'cause in this man.

301
00:48:41,517 --> 00:48:44,315
Neither do I.

302
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,858
Men! Attend to the crowd!

303
00:49:06,008 --> 00:49:07,873
Quiet!

304
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:12,447
Have you no respect for
our Roman procurator?

305
00:49:19,188 --> 00:49:23,591
As you know, every year I
release a criminal back to you.

306
00:49:24,627 --> 00:49:28,620
We are now holding a
notorious murderer...

307
00:49:28,797 --> 00:49:30,890
Barabbas.

308
00:49:47,116 --> 00:49:50,677
Which of the two men would
you have me release to you?

309
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:52,514
The murderer Barabbas...

310
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:54,680
or Jesus, called the Messiah?

311
00:49:54,823 --> 00:49:59,487
He is not the Messiah! He is an imposter!
A blasphemer!

312
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:03,427
Free Barabbas!

313
00:50:03,532 --> 00:50:06,729
Free Barabbas!

314
00:50:18,947 --> 00:50:24,351
Again I ask you: Which of these
two men should I release to you?

315
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,579
Free Barabbas!

316
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:28,919
Free Barabbas! Free Barabbas!

317
00:50:42,771 --> 00:50:44,705
Free him.

318
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,667
What would you have me do
with Jesus the Nazarene?

319
00:51:22,778 --> 00:51:24,871
Have him crucified!

320
00:51:30,018 --> 00:51:32,851
Crucify him! Crucify him!

321
00:51:40,195 --> 00:51:41,992
No!

322
00:51:42,131 --> 00:51:44,258
I will chastise him...

323
00:51:44,366 --> 00:51:46,561
but then I will set him free.

324
00:51:50,472 --> 00:51:53,407
See to it that the punishment
is severe, Abenader.

325
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:57,273
But don't let them kill the man.

326
00:52:34,183 --> 00:52:35,980
Shut up!

327
00:53:18,794 --> 00:53:21,285
My heart is ready, Father...

328
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:23,625
my heart is ready.

329
00:56:52,407 --> 00:56:54,136
One...

330
00:57:47,596 --> 00:57:49,689
My son...

331
00:57:50,732 --> 00:57:56,136
when, where, how...

332
00:57:58,039 --> 00:58:02,032
will you choose to be
delivered of this?

333
01:02:23,071 --> 01:02:26,234
If the world hates you...

334
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:32,075
remember that it has
hated me first.

335
01:02:37,085 --> 01:02:41,044
Remember also that no servant
is greater than his master.

336
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:47,460
If they persecuted me,
they will persecute you.

337
01:02:49,297 --> 01:02:51,356
You must not be afraid.

338
01:02:51,466 --> 01:02:53,934
The Helper will come...

339
01:02:56,037 --> 01:03:00,371
who reveals the
truth about God...

340
01:03:03,078 --> 01:03:04,773
and who comes from the Father.

341
01:03:13,054 --> 01:03:15,284
Stop!

342
01:03:17,058 --> 01:03:22,052
Enough! Your orders were
to punish this man...

343
01:03:24,399 --> 01:03:28,062
not to scourge him to death!

344
01:03:34,008 --> 01:03:36,738
Take him away.

345
01:03:37,545 --> 01:03:40,480
Get going!

346
01:03:48,823 --> 01:03:51,519
Get him out of here!

347
01:05:14,976 --> 01:05:16,773
Ouch!

348
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:24,509
Your majesty...

349
01:05:24,652 --> 01:05:27,052
Take care of it.

350
01:05:27,188 --> 01:05:29,850
A beautiful rose bush.

351
01:05:32,193 --> 01:05:36,391
Look at him...
king of the worms!

352
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:39,090
Hail, wormy king!

353
01:05:40,835 --> 01:05:43,929
A color fit for a king!

354
01:07:59,874 --> 01:08:02,741
We're here to pay our respects.

355
01:08:04,045 --> 01:08:06,639
A leader for our brotherhood!

356
01:08:56,464 --> 01:08:58,728
Behold the man.

357
01:09:01,335 --> 01:09:03,394
Crucify him!

358
01:09:03,538 --> 01:09:07,440
Crucify him! Crucify him!

359
01:09:14,382 --> 01:09:16,976
Isn't this enough? Look at him!

360
01:09:17,084 --> 01:09:19,450
Crucify him!

361
01:09:33,434 --> 01:09:35,959
Shall I crucify your king?

362
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:39,602
We have no king but Caesar!

363
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,075
Speak to me.

364
01:09:44,212 --> 01:09:48,046
I have the power to crucify
you, or else to set you free.

365
01:09:53,254 --> 01:10:01,923
You have no power over me except
what is given you from above.

366
01:10:04,932 --> 01:10:13,101
Therefore, it is he who delivered
me to you who has the greater sin.

367
01:10:15,142 --> 01:10:21,047
If you free him, Governor, you
are no friend of Caesar's.

368
01:10:23,751 --> 01:10:26,049
You must crucify him!

369
01:10:33,227 --> 01:10:36,355
Crucify him! Crucify him!

370
01:11:57,745 --> 01:12:01,943
It is you who want to crucify him, not I.
Look you to it.

371
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:05,712
I am innocent of
this man's blood.

372
01:12:24,405 --> 01:12:26,270
Abenader...

373
01:12:30,511 --> 01:12:32,536
Do as they wish.

374
01:13:07,415 --> 01:13:12,250
I am your servant, Father.
Your servant, and the son of your handmaid.

375
01:13:12,386 --> 01:13:18,382
Why do you embrace
your cross, fool?

376
01:13:21,896 --> 01:13:24,694
All right, your
highness, let's move!

377
01:14:59,514 --> 01:15:02,745
Help me get near him.

378
01:15:05,587 --> 01:15:09,648
This way.

379
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:00,600
This way, Mother.

380
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:39,540
Mother...

381
01:17:41,376 --> 01:17:43,469
Mother...

382
01:18:19,381 --> 01:18:21,872
I'm here...

383
01:18:24,286 --> 01:18:26,345
I'm here...

384
01:18:36,865 --> 01:18:41,359
See, Mother, I make
all things new.

385
01:19:11,766 --> 01:19:13,324
Who is that?

386
01:19:13,468 --> 01:19:15,129
Who?

387
01:19:16,304 --> 01:19:17,965
She's the Galilean's mother.

388
01:19:18,106 --> 01:19:20,165
Let's go.

389
01:19:22,244 --> 01:19:24,109
Come on!

390
01:20:34,249 --> 01:20:36,649
Don't fret, my daughter.

391
01:20:36,785 --> 01:20:39,345
Don't fret.

392
01:21:09,117 --> 01:21:11,108
Are you blind?

393
01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:15,519
Can't you see, he can't go on?

394
01:21:18,627 --> 01:21:20,720
Help him!

395
01:21:39,381 --> 01:21:41,611
You!

396
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:46,210
Yes, you! Get over here!

397
01:21:52,527 --> 01:21:53,755
What do you want from me?

398
01:21:53,862 --> 01:21:57,525
This criminal can't carry his
cross by himself anymore.

399
01:21:57,632 --> 01:22:01,227
You will help him!
Now get going!

400
01:22:01,369 --> 01:22:05,533
I can't do that. It's none of my business.
Get someone else!

401
01:22:05,674 --> 01:22:07,801
Help him! He is a holy man.

402
01:22:07,976 --> 01:22:10,001
Do as I tell you. Now move!
Let's go!

403
01:22:14,883 --> 01:22:21,220
All right, but I'm an innocent man, forced
to carry the cross of a condemned man.

404
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:25,086
Stay here. Wait for me.

405
01:24:21,109 --> 01:24:23,771
Permit me, my Lord.

406
01:24:53,641 --> 01:25:00,308
Who do you think you are?
Get away from here.

407
01:25:01,382 --> 01:25:03,373
Impossible people!

408
01:25:11,526 --> 01:25:14,859
Someone stop this!

409
01:25:30,078 --> 01:25:33,377
Stop! Stop!

410
01:25:37,418 --> 01:25:39,409
Stop!

411
01:25:41,089 --> 01:25:44,525
Leave him alone!

412
01:25:51,533 --> 01:25:57,165
If you don't stop, I won't carry
that cross one more step.

413
01:25:57,305 --> 01:25:59,967
I don't care what you do to me!

414
01:26:04,979 --> 01:26:08,142
All right, all right,
let's get moving.

415
01:26:08,683 --> 01:26:12,050
We don't have all day. Let's go!

416
01:26:17,759 --> 01:26:19,886
Let's go...

417
01:26:20,361 --> 01:26:22,454
Jew!

418
01:28:59,787 --> 01:29:01,687
Almost there.

419
01:29:08,296 --> 01:29:10,560
We're nearly there.

420
01:29:23,978 --> 01:29:27,106
Almost done. Almost done.

421
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:41,861
You have heard it said...

422
01:29:43,331 --> 01:29:46,698
you shall love your neighbor
and hate your enemy.

423
01:29:47,902 --> 01:29:50,462
But I say to you...

424
01:29:51,506 --> 01:29:56,876
love your enemies and pray for
those who persecute you...

425
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:02,709
For if you love only
those who love you...

426
01:30:05,987 --> 01:30:08,922
what reward is there in that?

427
01:31:05,713 --> 01:31:08,773
I am the good shepherd.

428
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:12,147
I lay down my life for my sheep.

429
01:31:12,286 --> 01:31:16,017
No one takes my life from me...

430
01:31:16,157 --> 01:31:18,387
but I lay it down
of my own accord.

431
01:31:18,526 --> 01:31:20,926
I have power to lay it down...

432
01:31:21,028 --> 01:31:24,896
and power to take it up again.

433
01:31:26,968 --> 01:31:29,163
This command is from my Father.

434
01:32:09,677 --> 01:32:14,273
Get away now, you're free to go.
Go on! Go on!

435
01:32:21,822 --> 01:32:24,086
You can get up now!

436
01:33:04,699 --> 01:33:07,793
Get up, your majesty.

437
01:33:08,936 --> 01:33:11,097
Can't you get up?

438
01:33:12,506 --> 01:33:15,600
We haven't got all day.

439
01:33:23,884 --> 01:33:25,749
Come on, move! We're ready.

440
01:33:25,886 --> 01:33:28,616
Get up, your highness.

441
01:35:11,525 --> 01:35:13,755
You are my friends.

442
01:35:15,763 --> 01:35:22,191
There is no greater love than for a man
to lay down his life for his friends.

443
01:36:19,059 --> 01:36:22,358
I cannot be with you
much longer, my friends.

444
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:27,661
You cannot go where I am going.

445
01:36:28,302 --> 01:36:33,069
My commandment to you after
I am gone is this...

446
01:36:33,174 --> 01:36:35,233
love one another.

447
01:36:36,076 --> 01:36:43,505
As I have loved you,
so love one another.

448
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:09,368
You believe in me.

449
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:22,978
You know that I am the Way,
the Truth, and the Life.

450
01:37:23,123 --> 01:37:28,117
And no one comes to
the Father but by me.

451
01:37:32,933 --> 01:37:35,197
Further out...

452
01:37:41,976 --> 01:37:45,537
idiots! Let me show
you how to do it.

453
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:47,704
Like this!

454
01:38:05,532 --> 01:38:10,560
There! No, get in there.
Hold the hand open like this.

455
01:38:10,704 --> 01:38:13,138
Father, forgive them...

456
01:39:02,656 --> 01:39:10,427
Father, Father my Father...
my God...

457
01:39:12,966 --> 01:39:16,231
They don't know...
they don't know...

458
01:39:20,074 --> 01:39:26,240
Stupid mongrels! Turn the wood
over on its face, idiots!

459
01:40:54,435 --> 01:41:03,366
Take this and eat. This is my
body which is given up for you.

460
01:42:46,613 --> 01:42:50,379
Take this and drink.

461
01:42:51,418 --> 01:42:55,320
This is my blood of
the new covenant...

462
01:42:55,422 --> 01:43:00,018
which is given for you and for
many, for the forgiveness of sins.

463
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:02,560
Do this in memory of me.

464
01:43:31,224 --> 01:43:37,527
If you are the son of God,
why don't you save yourself?

465
01:43:38,398 --> 01:43:45,327
Prove to us you are
who you say you are.

466
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:09,760
You said you could destroy the temple
and rebuild it in three days...

467
01:44:10,797 --> 01:44:14,563
and yet you cannot come
down from that cross.

468
01:44:14,701 --> 01:44:17,329
If he is the Messiah...

469
01:44:17,471 --> 01:44:23,273
I say let him come
down from the cross...

470
01:44:23,377 --> 01:44:27,177
so that we may see and believe.

471
01:44:36,289 --> 01:44:39,554
Father, forgive them...

472
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:46,597
they know not what they do.

473
01:44:50,704 --> 01:44:53,400
Listen...

474
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:57,306
he prays for you.

475
01:45:12,125 --> 01:45:17,961
We deserve this, Gesmas,
but he does not.

476
01:45:20,567 --> 01:45:27,063
I have sinned, and my
punishment is just.

477
01:45:28,408 --> 01:45:32,139
You would be justified
in condemning me.

478
01:45:33,413 --> 01:45:42,185
I ask only that you remember me,
Lord, when you enter your kingdom.

479
01:45:44,891 --> 01:45:56,496
Amen, I tell you, on this day you
shall be with me in paradise.

480
01:49:11,231 --> 01:49:13,426
I thirst.

481
01:49:48,201 --> 01:49:50,863
Flesh of my flesh...

482
01:49:53,073 --> 01:49:56,372
heart of my heart...

483
01:49:57,911 --> 01:50:03,281
My son, let me die with you.

484
01:50:06,519 --> 01:50:08,384
Woman...

485
01:50:09,422 --> 01:50:12,789
behold your son.

486
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,794
Son, behold...

487
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:29,801
your mother.

488
01:50:39,786 --> 01:50:42,949
There is no one left.

489
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:48,984
No one, Jesus!

490
01:50:59,205 --> 01:51:01,264
My God...

491
01:51:06,279 --> 01:51:08,509
My God...

492
01:51:15,422 --> 01:51:19,188
why have you forsaken me?

493
01:51:38,178 --> 01:51:41,011
It is accomplished.

494
01:52:02,969 --> 01:52:12,139
Father, into your hands...
I commend... my spirit.

495
01:54:04,123 --> 01:54:07,286
