1
00:00:55,085 --> 00:00:58,380
<i>This is the story of how I died.</i>

2
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:04,511
<i>But don't worry, this is a fun story,
and the truth is, it isn't even mine.</i>

3
00:01:04,636 --> 00:01:07,681
<i>This is the story of a girl
named Rapunzel.</i>

4
00:01:09,474 --> 00:01:10,475
<i>And it starts with the sun.</i>

5
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:17,649
<i>Once upon a time, a single drop
of sunlight fell from the heavens.</i>

6
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:23,405
<i>And from this small drop of sun
grew a magic golden flower.</i>

7
00:01:24,322 --> 00:01:27,534
<i>It had the ability to heal
the sick and injured.</i>

8
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:32,539
<i>You see that old woman over there?
You might want to remember her.</i>

9
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:33,665
<i>She's kind of important.</i>

10
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,419
<i>Centuries passed</i>

11
00:01:37,544 --> 00:01:39,754
<i>and a hop, skip and a boat ride away
there grew a kingdom.</i>

12
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:43,925
<i>The kingdom was ruled
by a beloved king and queen.</i>

13
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:47,554
<i>And the queen
was about to have a baby.</i>

14
00:01:48,263 --> 00:01:49,264
<i>But she got sick.</i>

15
00:01:50,432 --> 00:01:51,475
<i>Really sick.</i>

16
00:01:52,142 --> 00:01:53,435
<i>She was running out of time,</i>

17
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,563
<i>and that's when people
start to look for a miracle.</i>

18
00:01:56,688 --> 00:01:59,983
<i>Or in this case, a magic golden flower.</i>

19
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:03,236
<i>I told you she'd be important.</i>

20
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:05,614
<i>Instead of sharing the sun's gift,</i>

21
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:08,366
<i>this woman, Mother Gothel,
hoarded its healing power</i>

22
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:11,787
<i>and used it to keep herself young
for hundreds of years.</i>

23
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:15,332
<i>And all she had to do
was sing a special song.</i>

24
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:19,753
<i>♪ Flower, gleam and glow ♪</i>

25
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:24,216

<i>♪ What once was mine ♪</i>

29
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:39,314
<i>You get the gist. She sings to it,
she turns young. Creepy, right?</i>

30
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,201
We found it!

31
00:02:57,415 --> 00:03:02,045
<i>The magic of the golden flower
healed the queen.</i>

32
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:07,884
<i>A healthy baby girl, a princess
was born, with beautiful golden hair.</i>

33
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:19,604
<i>I'll give you a hint, that's Rapunzel.</i>

34
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:22,816
<i>To celebrate her birth,</i>

35
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:26,236
<i>the king and queen
launched a flying lantern into the sky.</i>

36
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:34,870
<i>And for that one moment,
everything was perfect.</i>

37
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:39,374
<i>And then that moment ended.</i>

38

<i>Gothel broke into the castle,

42
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,483
<i>and just like that, gone!</i>

43
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:10,071
<i>The kingdom searched and searched,
but they could not find the princess.</i>

44
00:04:10,447 --> 00:04:13,492
<i>For deep within the forest,
in a hidden tower,</i>

45
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:15,076

<i>Gothel had found
her new magic flower,</i>

50
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:30,217
<i>but this time,
she was determined to keep it hidden.</i>

51
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:33,386
Why can't I go outside?

52
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:36,139
The outside world is a dangerous place,

53
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:38,725
filled with horrible, selfish people.

54
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,895
You must stay here, where you're safe.

55
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,605
Do you understand, flower?

56
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,065
Yes, Mommy.

57
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:52,906
<i>But the walls of that tower
could not hide everything.</i>

58
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:57,661
<i>Each year, on her birthday,</i>

59
00:04:57,786 --> 00:05:01,289
<i>the king and queen released
thousands of lanterns into the sky</i>

60
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:06,461
<i>in hope that one day
their lost princess would return.</i>

61
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:32,487
Well, I guess
Pascal's not hiding out here.

62
00:05:35,532 --> 00:05:36,658
Gotcha!

63
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,956
That's 22 for me.
How about 23 out of 45?

64
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:46,501
Okay. Well, what do you want to do?

65
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:54,050
Yeah. I don't think so.
I like it in here, and so do you.

66
00:05:56,303 --> 00:05:59,139

Rider, come on!

95
00:08:47,474 --> 00:08:52,687
Hold on. Yep. I'm used to it.
Guys, I want a castle.

96
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:55,982
We do this job,
you can buy your own castle.

97
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,330
- Hay fever?
- Yeah.

98
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:16,962
Wait! Hey, wait!

99
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:20,549
Can't you picture me in a castle
of my own? Because I certainly can.

100
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:23,468
All the things we've seen,
and it's only 8:00 in the morning!

101
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:26,680
Gentlemen, this is a very big day!

102
00:09:27,848 --> 00:09:31,309
This is it! This is a very big day, Pascal.

103
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,272
I'm finally going to do it.
I'm going to ask her.

104
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:37,440
Rapunzel!

105
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:39,651

106
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,653
It's time!

107
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:46,199
I know, I know.
Come on. Don't let her see you.

108
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:52,539
Rapunzel!
I'm not getting any younger down here!

109
00:09:53,415 --> 00:09:54,916
Coming, Mother!

110
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:21,777
Hi. Welcome home, Mother.

111
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:25,113
Rapunzel, how you manage to do that

112
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:28,325
every single day without fail.

113
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,827
It looks absolutely exhausting, darling.

114
00:10:30,952 --> 00:10:33,330
Oh, it's nothing.

115
00:10:33,455 --> 00:10:35,665
Then I don't know why it takes so long.

116
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,210
Oh, darling, I'm just teasing.

117
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:41,671
All right.

118
00:10:41,797 --> 00:10:45,091
So, Mother, as you know
tomorrow is a very big day...

119
00:10:45,217 --> 00:10:46,760
Rapunzel, look in that mirror.

120
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:48,345
You know what I see?

121
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,474
I see a strong, confident,
beautiful young lady.

122
00:10:53,642 --> 00:10:55,769
Oh, look, you're here, too.

123
00:10:55,894 --> 00:10:59,272
I'm just teasing.
Stop taking everything so seriously.

124
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:02,818
Okay. So, Mother,
as I was saying, tomorrow is...

125
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:05,362
Rapunzel,
Mother's feeling a little run-down.

126
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:08,406
Would you sing for me, dear?
Then we'll talk.

127
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:10,826
Of course, Mother.

- So, Mother,

133
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,054
earlier I was saying tomorrow
is a big day, and you didn't respond.

134
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:33,890
So, I'm just going to tell you,
it's my birthday!

135
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,893
- Ta-da!
- No, no, no. Can't be.

136
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:40,355
I distinctly remember.
Your birthday was last year.

137
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,776
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.

138
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,115
Mother, I'm turning 18,
and I wanted to ask...

139
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:53,243
What I really want for this birthday...

140
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,745
Actually what I wanted
for quite a few birthdays now...

141
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:57,956
Rapunzel, please,
stop with the mumbling.

142
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:00,667
You know how I feel about
the mumbling. Blah-blah-blah-blah.

143
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:03,420
It's very annoying!
I'm just teasing. You're adorable.

144
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:05,338
I love you so much, darling.

145
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:12,846
I want to see the floating lights.

146
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:16,641
What?

147
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:20,520
I was hoping you would take me
to see the floating lights.

148
00:12:21,938 --> 00:12:23,690
You mean the stars.

149
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:25,275
That's the thing.

150
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:29,613
I've charted stars,
and they're always constant.

151
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:33,575
But these, they appear every year
on my birthday, Mother.

152
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,619
Only on my birthday.

153
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:40,874
And I can't help but feel like
they're meant for me.

154
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,627
I need to see them, Mother.

155
00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:47,214
And not just from my window, in person.

156
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,925
I have to know what they are.

157
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,054
You want to go outside?

Don't ever ask to leave this tower again.

00:14:58,386 --> 00:14:59,596
Yes, Mother.

195
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:03,850
I love you very much, dear.

196
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:06,186

Ta-ta! I'll see you in a bit, my flower!

202
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:31,336
I'll be here.

203
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:56,361
Oh, no.

204
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:58,989
This is bad. This is very, very bad.

205
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:00,740
This is really bad.

206
00:16:02,242 --> 00:16:04,244
They just can't get my nose right.

207
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:05,704
Who cares?

208
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:08,915
It's easy for you to say.
You guys look amazing.

209
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:27,225
All right. Okay.
Give me a boost and I'll pull you up.

210
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:30,145
Give us the satchel first.

211
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:36,943
I can't believe that after all we've been
through together, you don't trust me?

212
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:40,489
Ouch.

213
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,415
Now help us up, pretty boy!

214
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,376
Sorry, my hands are full.

215
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:55,504
What?

216
00:16:56,213 --> 00:16:57,255
Rider!

217
00:17:03,762 --> 00:17:05,806
Retrieve that satchel at any cost!

218
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:07,182
Yes, sir!

219
00:17:23,782 --> 00:17:26,326
We got him now, Maximus.

220
00:17:39,673 --> 00:17:41,675
Come on, fleabag! Forward!

221
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:45,637
No.

222
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:51,226
Stop it! Stop it!
Give it to me! Give me that!

223
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:34,913
Alone at last.

224
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:13,762
Okay. I've got a person in my closet.

225
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:16,431
I've got a person in my closet.

226
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:21,520
I've got a person in my closet!

227
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:26,775
Too weak to handle myself out there,
huh, Mother?

228
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,028
Well, tell that to my frying pan.

229
00:22:11,611 --> 00:22:13,238
Rapunzel!

230
00:22:14,948 --> 00:22:16,741
Let down your hair!

231
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:18,660
One moment, Mother!

232
00:22:18,785 --> 00:22:20,787
I have a big surprise!

233
00:22:20,912 --> 00:22:23,165
I do, too!

234
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,584
I bet my surprise is bigger!

235
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:28,253
I seriously doubt it.

236
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:33,008
I brought back parsnips. I'm going
to make hazelnut soup for dinner.

237
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:35,510
Your favourite. Surprise!

238
00:22:35,635 --> 00:22:37,971
Well, Mother,
there's something I want to tell you.

239
00:22:38,096 --> 00:22:40,891
Oh, Rapunzel, you know I hate
leaving you after a fight.

240
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:43,435
Especially when I've done
absolutely nothing wrong.

241
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,854
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said earlier.

242
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:48,482
I hope you're not still talking
about the stars.

243
00:22:48,607 --> 00:22:50,984
"Floating lights,"
and, yes, I'm leading up to that.

244
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:53,570
Because I really thought
we dropped the issue, sweetheart.

245
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:55,739
No, Mother, I'm just saying,

246
00:22:55,864 --> 00:22:58,325
you think I'm not strong enough
to handle myself out there.

247
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,661
I know you're not strong enough
to handle yourself out there.

248
00:23:01,787 --> 00:23:05,040
- But if you just...
- We're done talking about this.

249
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:07,626
- Trust me! I know what I'm...
- Rapunzel.

250
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:10,253
- Oh, come on!
- Enough with the lights!

251
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:14,800
You are not leaving this tower! Ever!

252
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:24,810
Great. Now I'm the bad guy.

253
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,117
All I was going to say, Mother, is that...

254
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:43,537
I know what I want for my birthday now.

255
00:23:43,662 --> 00:23:45,664
And what is that?

256
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:47,374
New paint.

257
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:51,378
The paint made from the white shells
you once brought me.

258
00:23:51,503 --> 00:23:56,633
That is a very long trip, Rapunzel.
Almost three days' time.

259
00:23:56,925 --> 00:24:01,972
I just thought it was a better idea
than the stars.

260
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:08,436
You'll be all right on your own?

261
00:24:09,312 --> 00:24:11,982
I know I'm safe as long as I'm here.

262
00:24:20,073 --> 00:24:22,492
<i>I'll be back in three days' time.</i>

263
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:25,704
<i>I love you very much, dear.</i>

264
00:24:26,705 --> 00:24:27,998
<i>I love you more.</i>

265
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,209
<i>I love you most.</i>

266
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:53,064
Okay.

267
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:41,530
Is this hair?

268
00:25:42,322 --> 00:25:45,450
Struggling... Struggling is pointless.

269
00:25:49,037 --> 00:25:53,583
I know why you're here,
and I'm not afraid of you.

270
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:55,627
What?

271
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:07,806
Who are you?
And how did you find me?

272
00:26:11,351 --> 00:26:14,604
Who are you, and how did you find me?

273
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:22,112
I know not who you are,
nor how I came to find you.

274
00:26:22,237 --> 00:26:24,114
But may I just say...

275
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,200
Hi.

276
00:26:29,494 --> 00:26:32,164
How you doing?
The name's Flynn Rider.

277
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,625
How's your day going?

278
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:40,630
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Rider?

279
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:42,841
- All right, blondie.
- Rapunzel.

280
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:44,593
<i>Gesundheit.</i> Here's the deal.

281
00:26:44,718 --> 00:26:47,596
I was in a situation,
gallivanting through the forest.

282
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:49,973
I came across your tower and...

283
00:26:51,516 --> 00:26:52,684
Where is my satchel?

284
00:26:53,018 --> 00:26:56,188
I've hidden it.
Somewhere you'll never find it.

285
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:00,984
It's in that pot, isn't it?

286
00:27:07,908 --> 00:27:09,618
Would you stop that?

287
00:27:09,743 --> 00:27:12,579
Now it's hidden
where you'll never find it.

288
00:27:13,455 --> 00:27:17,417
So, what do you want with my hair?
To cut it?

289
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:18,752
- What?
- Sell it?

290
00:27:18,877 --> 00:27:22,506
No! Listen, the only thing
I want to do with your hair

291
00:27:22,631 --> 00:27:25,300
is to get out of it, literally.

292
00:27:26,218 --> 00:27:28,804
Wait. You don't want my hair?

293
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:30,847
Why on earth would I want your hair?

294
00:27:30,972 --> 00:27:33,558
Look, I was being chased,
I saw a tower, I climbed it.

295
00:27:33,683 --> 00:27:36,228
- End of story.
- You're telling the truth?

296
00:27:36,394 --> 00:27:37,646
Yes.

297
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,369
I know. I need someone to take me.

298
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:55,497
I think he's telling the truth, too.

299
00:27:55,622 --> 00:27:58,750
He doesn't have fangs.
But what choice do I have?

300
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:04,631
Okay, Flynn Rider,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

301
00:28:04,756 --> 00:28:06,550
- Deal?
- Look this way.

302
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:10,929
Do you know what these are?

303
00:28:11,054 --> 00:28:14,141
You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?

304
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:18,145
Lanterns? I knew they weren't stars.

305
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:21,565
Well, tomorrow evening,

306
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,527
they will light the night sky
with these lanterns.

307
00:28:25,652 --> 00:28:29,197
You will act as my guide,
take me to these lanterns,

308
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:30,866
and return me home safely.

309
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:35,287
Then, and only then,
will I return your satchel to you.

310
00:28:35,412 --> 00:28:36,580
That is my deal.

311
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:38,039
Yeah.

312
00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:40,500
No can do.

313
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:44,379
Unfortunately the kingdom and I
aren't exactly simpatico at the moment,

314
00:28:44,504 --> 00:28:46,756
so I won't be taking you anywhere.

315
00:28:53,388 --> 00:28:56,516
Something brought you here,
Flynn Rider.

316
00:28:56,641 --> 00:28:58,018
Call it what you will,

317
00:28:58,143 --> 00:29:00,937
- fate, destiny...
- A horse.

318
00:29:01,062 --> 00:29:03,356
So I have made the decision
to trust you.

319
00:29:03,482 --> 00:29:04,483
A horrible decision, really.

320
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:07,652
But trust me when I tell you this.

321
00:29:09,654 --> 00:29:13,074
You can tear this tower apart
brick by brick,

322
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,913
but without my help, you will never find
your precious satchel.

323
00:29:19,498 --> 00:29:20,791
Let me get this straight.

324
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:24,085
I take you to see the lanterns,
bring you back home,

325
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:26,046
and you'll give me back my satchel?

326
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:27,631
I promise.

327
00:29:29,508 --> 00:29:34,179
And when I promise something,
I never, ever break that promise.

328
00:29:36,598 --> 00:29:37,933
Ever.

329
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:43,563
All right, listen.
I didn't want to have to do this,

330
00:29:43,688 --> 00:29:45,398
but you leave me no choice.

331
00:29:46,191 --> 00:29:48,026
Here comes the smoulder.

332
00:29:55,617 --> 00:29:59,579
This is kind of an off day for me.
This doesn't normally happen.

333
00:29:59,704 --> 00:30:01,456
Fine! I'll take you to see the lanterns.

334
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:02,916
Really?

335
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:04,918
Oops.

336
00:30:05,043 --> 00:30:07,003
You broke my smoulder.

337
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:14,511
Are you coming, blondie?

00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:06,623
I can't believe I did this!

351
00:32:07,332 --> 00:32:11,628
I can't believe I did this.
I can't believe I did this!

352
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:15,090
Mother would be so furious.

353
00:32:15,215 --> 00:32:18,552
But that's okay. What she doesn't know
won't kill her, right?

354
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:21,429
Oh, my gosh! This would kill her.

355
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:24,850
This is so fun!

356
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,186
I am a horrible daughter.
I'm going back.

357
00:32:28,603 --> 00:32:30,897
I am never going back!

358
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,068
I am a despicable human being!

359
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,698
Best day ever!

360
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:52,210
You know,
I can't help but notice you seem

361
00:32:52,335 --> 00:32:54,838
a little at war with yourself here.

362
00:32:55,714 --> 00:32:58,258
- What?
- I'm only picking up bits and pieces.

363
00:32:58,383 --> 00:33:02,012
Overprotective mother,
forbidden road trip. This is serious stuff.

364
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:05,724
But let me ease your conscience.
This is part of growing up.

365
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:10,020
A little rebellion, a little adventure,
that's good. Healthy, even.

366
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,023
You think?

367
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:16,276
I know. You're way over-thinking this,
trust me.

368
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:18,403
Does your mother deserve it? No.

369
00:33:18,528 --> 00:33:21,406
Would this break her heart
and crush her soul? Of course.

370
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:23,575
But you've got to do it.

371
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:25,952
"Break her heart"?

372
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:29,039
- In half.
- "Crush her soul"?

373
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:31,249
Like a grape.

374
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:34,336
She would be heartbroken. You're right.

375
00:33:34,461 --> 00:33:37,964
I am, aren't I? Oh, bother.

376
00:33:38,673 --> 00:33:43,011
All right. I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm letting you out of the deal.

377
00:33:43,136 --> 00:33:46,139
- What?
- That's right, but don't thank me.

378
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:49,434
Let's turn around and get you home.
Here's your pan, here's your frog.

379
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,769
I get back my satchel,

380
00:33:50,894 --> 00:33:54,189
you get back a mother-daughter
relationship based on mutual trust,

381
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:57,484
and <i>voilà,</i>
we part ways as unlikely friends.

382
00:33:57,609 --> 00:34:00,612
No. I am seeing those lanterns.

383
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:04,324
Oh, come on! What is it going to take
for me to get my satchel back?

384
00:34:04,449 --> 00:34:06,034
I will use this.

385
00:34:09,162 --> 00:34:12,290
Is it ruffians? Thugs?
Have they come for me?

386
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:19,005
Stay calm. It can probably smell fear.

387
00:34:20,882 --> 00:34:25,011
Sorry. Guess I'm just a little bit jumpy.

388
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:29,808
Probably be best if we avoid ruffians
and thugs, though.

389
00:34:30,642 --> 00:34:33,103
Yeah, that would probably be best.

390
00:34:34,688 --> 00:34:37,190
Are you hungry?
I know a great place for lunch.

391
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,526
Where?

392
00:34:39,651 --> 00:34:42,404
Don't you worry.
You'll know it when you smell it.

393
00:35:20,525 --> 00:35:22,194
A palace horse.

394
00:35:23,445 --> 00:35:25,155
Where's your rider?

395
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:29,326
Rapunzel!

396
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:40,420
Rapunzel! Let down your hair!

397
00:36:53,952 --> 00:36:57,205
I know it's around here somewhere.

398
00:36:57,998 --> 00:37:01,460
Ah, there it is! The Snuggly Duckling.

399
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:04,504
Don't worry. Very quaint place.
Perfect for you.

400
00:37:04,629 --> 00:37:07,883
Don't want you scaring and giving up
on this whole endeavour now, do we?

401
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:11,428
- Well, I do like ducklings.
- Yay!

402
00:37:13,096 --> 00:37:15,390
Garçon, your finest table, please!

403
00:37:22,272 --> 00:37:25,525
You smell that?
Take a deep breath through the nose.

404
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:28,153
Really let that seep in.
What are you getting?

405
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:31,948
To me, it's part man-smell and the other
part is really bad man-smell.

406
00:37:32,073 --> 00:37:35,827
I don't know why, but overall it smells
like the colour brown. Your thoughts?

407
00:37:36,286 --> 00:37:38,663
That's a lot of hair.

408
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,082
She's growing it out.
Is that blood in your moustache?

409
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:43,835
Goldie, look at all the blood
in his moustache!

410
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:46,004
Good sir, that's a lot of blood!

411
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:51,718
You don't look so good, blondie. Maybe
we should get you home, call it a day.

412
00:37:51,843 --> 00:37:54,387
Probably better off.
This is a five-star joint.

413
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:58,016
If you can't handle this place, maybe
you should be back in your tower.

414
00:37:59,392 --> 00:38:00,477
Is this you?

415
00:38:06,108 --> 00:38:07,109
- Now they're just being mean.
- It's him, all right.

416
00:38:07,234 --> 00:38:09,820
Greno, go find some guards.

417
00:38:09,945 --> 00:38:13,281
That reward
is going to buy me a new hook.

418
00:38:13,406 --> 00:38:16,827
- I could use the money.
- What about me? I'm broke!

419
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:18,036
Get back!

420
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:19,287
- Mine!
- Ruffians, stop!

421
00:38:19,412 --> 00:38:22,207
- We can work this out!
- Leave him alone!

422
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:23,542
Gentlemen, please!

423
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:26,962
Give me back my guide! Ruffians!

424
00:38:35,428 --> 00:38:36,930
Not the nose! Not the nose!

425
00:38:40,016 --> 00:38:41,726
Put him down!

426
00:38:44,521 --> 00:38:48,442
I don't know where I am, and I need him
to take me to see the lanterns

427
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:51,445
because I've been dreaming about them
my entire life!

428
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:56,491
Find your humanity!
Haven't any of you ever had a dream?

429
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:11,214
I had a dream once.

Where's Rider? Where is he?

00:42:38,755 --> 00:42:40,841
I know he's in here somewhere.
Find him.

I was talking to her.

a tall drink of water.

00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:23,527
Oh, stop it, you big lug.

00:44:27,405 --> 00:44:28,782
Knife!

I didn't know you had that in you

I know!

00:44:43,713 --> 00:44:47,008
So... Flynn? Where are you from?

511
00:44:47,134 --> 00:44:49,553
Whoa! Sorry, blondie,
I don't do back-story.

512
00:44:49,678 --> 00:44:52,222
However, I am becoming
very interested in yours.

513
00:44:52,347 --> 00:44:54,891
I know I'm not supposed
to mention the hair.

514
00:44:55,016 --> 00:44:56,518
- Nope.
- Or the mother.

515
00:44:56,643 --> 00:44:59,229
- Uh-uh.
- I'm too scared to ask about the frog.

516
00:44:59,438 --> 00:45:00,772
- Chameleon.
- Nuance.

517
00:45:01,106 --> 00:45:05,569
Here's my question, though,
if you want to see the lanterns so badly

518
00:45:05,694 --> 00:45:07,571
why haven't you gone before?

519
00:45:10,198 --> 00:45:11,408
Well...

520
00:45:18,623 --> 00:45:19,666
Flynn?

521
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:21,418
Rider?

522
00:45:21,543 --> 00:45:23,503
Run. Run!

523
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:44,149
- Who's that?
- They don't like me.

524
00:45:44,733 --> 00:45:47,444
- Who's that?
- They don't like me either.

525
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:48,612
Who's that?

526
00:45:48,737 --> 00:45:51,656
Let's assume that everyone in here
doesn't like me.

527
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:52,949
Here.

528
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:04,044
I waited a long time for this.

529
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:17,099
Oh, mama!
I have got to get me one of these!

530
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:29,778
You should know that this
is the strangest thing I've ever done!

531
00:46:35,117 --> 00:46:36,952
How about two out of three?

532
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:45,127
Flynn, look out!

533
00:46:50,423 --> 00:46:52,467
You should see your faces,
because you look...

534
00:46:53,468 --> 00:46:55,011
...ridiculous.

535
00:47:02,144 --> 00:47:04,855
Come on, blondie! Jump!

536
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,863
It's no use. I can't see anything.

537
00:48:42,285 --> 00:48:45,455
Hey, there's no point.
It's pitch-black down there.

538
00:48:53,547 --> 00:48:55,340
This is all my fault.

539
00:48:57,092 --> 00:49:00,095
She was right.
I never should have done this.

540
00:49:06,351 --> 00:49:08,395
I'm so sorry, Flynn.

00:49:16,194 --> 00:49:17,362

551
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:44,366
I didn't see that coming.
The hair actually glows.

552
00:50:44,491 --> 00:50:46,076
- Why does her hair glow?
- Eugene!

553
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:47,285
What?

554
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:51,164

555
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:54,584
Why is he smiling at me?

556
00:51:19,818 --> 00:51:22,612
I'll kill him. I'll kill that Rider!

559
00:51:32,581 --> 00:51:35,459

then be on your way.

I'm just interested in your hair
and the magical qualities it possesses.

Forever, I guess.

Mother says when I was a baby,
people tried to cut it.

588
00:53:50,302 --> 00:53:52,179
They wanted to take it for themselves.

589
00:53:52,804 --> 00:53:57,684
But once it's cut,
it turns brown and loses its power.

590
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,646
A gift like that, it has to be protected.

591
00:54:02,647 --> 00:54:05,025
That's why Mother never let me...

00:54:08,487 --> 00:54:11,406
That's why I never left and...

593
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:16,870
You never left that tower.

594
00:54:20,665 --> 00:54:22,793
And you're still going to go back?

595
00:54:23,084 --> 00:54:25,337
No! Yes.

596
00:54:27,547 --> 00:54:29,466
It's complicated.

597
00:54:40,018 --> 00:54:42,979
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?

598
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:45,107
Ah, yeah. Well...

599
00:54:45,232 --> 00:54:48,485
I'll spare you the sob story
of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert.

600
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:51,905
It's a little bit of a downer.

601
00:54:58,203 --> 00:55:02,165
There was this book I used to read
every night to all the younger kids.

602
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:03,917
<i>The Tales of Flynnagan Rider.</i>

603
00:55:04,042 --> 00:55:08,588
Swashbuckling rogue, richest man
alive, not bad with the ladies either.

604
00:55:08,713 --> 00:55:11,258
Not that he'd ever brag about it,
of course.

605
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,552
Was he a thief, too?

606
00:55:15,429 --> 00:55:16,805
Well, no.

607
00:55:17,472 --> 00:55:20,350
He had enough money to do anything
that he wanted to do.

608
00:55:20,475 --> 00:55:22,018
He could go anywhere
that he wanted to go.

609
00:55:22,811 --> 00:55:26,773
And for a kid with nothing,
I don't know, I...

610
00:55:28,483 --> 00:55:30,193
Just seemed like the better option.

611
00:55:31,403 --> 00:55:33,780
You can't tell anyone about this, okay?

612
00:55:34,281 --> 00:55:36,366
It could ruin my whole reputation.

613
00:55:37,617 --> 00:55:39,035
We wouldn't want that.

614
00:55:39,161 --> 00:55:41,663
A fake reputation is all a man has.

615
00:55:49,796 --> 00:55:51,465
Well, I should...

616
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:55,010
I should get some more firewood.

617
00:55:57,763 --> 00:56:03,393
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert
much better than Flynn Rider.

618
00:56:06,605 --> 00:56:09,733
Then you'd be the first. But thank you.

619
00:56:19,534 --> 00:56:22,788
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

620
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:24,247
Mother?

621
00:56:24,372 --> 00:56:25,832
Hello, dear.

622
00:56:29,044 --> 00:56:30,295
How did you find me?

623
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:32,422
It was easy, really.

624
00:56:32,547 --> 00:56:36,927
I just listened for the sound of complete
and utter betrayal and followed that.

625
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,475
- We're going home. Now.
- You don't understand.

626
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:48,021
I've been on this incredible journey,
and I've seen and learned so much.

627
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:50,107
I even met someone.

628
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:53,235
Yes, the wanted thief. I'm so proud.
Come on.

629
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,238
Mother, wait. I think...

630
00:56:58,031 --> 00:56:59,491
I think he likes me.

631
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:02,452
Likes you?
Please, Rapunzel, that's demented!

So, can I ask you something?

657
00:58:36,755 --> 00:58:40,050
Is there any chance that I'm going to get
super strength in my hand?

658
00:58:40,175 --> 00:58:43,595
Because I'm not going to lie.
That would be stupendous.

659
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:46,098
Hey, you all right?

660
00:58:47,516 --> 00:58:52,312
Sorry, yes. Just lost in thought, I guess.

661
00:58:55,023 --> 00:58:56,149
Here's the thing,

662
00:58:56,274 --> 00:58:59,528
superhuman good looks,
I've always had them. Born with it.

663
00:58:59,653 --> 00:59:03,824
But superhuman strength. Can you
imagine the possibilities of this?

664
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,038
Patience, boys.

665
00:59:10,705 --> 00:59:14,835
All good things to those who wait.

666
00:59:34,312 --> 00:59:36,773
Well, I hope you're here to apologise.

667
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:42,320
No, put me down. Stop it! No!

668
00:59:42,446 --> 00:59:44,406
Let me go!

669
00:59:45,198 --> 00:59:46,950
Give me him!

670
00:59:47,242 --> 00:59:49,035
Stop, stop, stop!

671
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:01,131
Easy, boy. Easy! Settle down.

672
01:00:03,383 --> 01:00:04,718
Easy, boy. Easy.

673
01:00:05,051 --> 01:00:06,720
Easy.

674
01:00:08,513 --> 01:00:10,056
That's it.

675
01:00:13,435 --> 01:00:14,519
Now sit.

676
01:00:16,354 --> 01:00:17,397
Sit!

677
01:00:18,023 --> 01:00:19,983
- What?
- Now drop the boot.

678
01:00:20,567 --> 01:00:21,777
Drop it.

679
01:00:24,446 --> 01:00:28,867
You're such a good boy! Yes, you are!

680
01:00:30,452 --> 01:00:33,997
You all tired from chasing this bad man
all over the place?

681
01:00:34,122 --> 01:00:37,959
- Excuse me?
- Nobody appreciates you, do they?

682
01:00:38,084 --> 01:00:39,169
Do they?

683
01:00:39,294 --> 01:00:41,338
Oh, come on. He's a bad horse!

684
01:00:41,463 --> 01:00:44,049
Oh, he's nothing but a big sweetheart.

685
01:00:45,258 --> 01:00:46,593
Isn't that right...

686
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:48,678
Maximus?

687
01:00:49,387 --> 01:00:51,723
You've got to be kidding me.

688
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:56,561
Look. Today is kind of
the biggest day of my life,

689
01:00:57,145 --> 01:01:00,982
and the thing is,
I need you not to get him arrested.

690
01:01:01,817 --> 01:01:02,984
Just for 24 hours,

691
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:06,905
and then you can chase each other
to your heart's content.

692
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:15,122
And it's also my birthday.
Just so you know.

693
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,550
Excuse me. Sorry.

694
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:33,366
Thank you!

695
01:02:49,091 --> 01:02:50,884
It's for the lost princess.

696
01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:11,089
To the boats!

697
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:23,351
Hey, Max!

698
01:04:26,813 --> 01:04:29,649
What? I bought them.

699
01:04:32,527 --> 01:04:33,987
Most of them.

700
01:04:35,697 --> 01:04:37,240
Where are we going?

701
01:04:37,365 --> 01:04:41,244
Best day of your life?
I figured you should have a decent seat.

702
01:04:59,805 --> 01:05:01,139
You okay?

703
01:05:02,015 --> 01:05:03,600
I'm terrified.

704
01:05:04,518 --> 01:05:05,769
Why?

705
01:05:06,561 --> 01:05:10,857
I've been looking out a window
for 18 years,

706
01:05:10,982 --> 01:05:15,737
dreaming about what it might feel like
when those lights rise in the sky.

707
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:20,700
What if it's not everything
that I dreamed it would be?

708
01:05:23,328 --> 01:05:24,663
It will be.

709
01:05:26,164 --> 01:05:30,710
And what if it is? What do I do then?

710
01:05:31,253 --> 01:05:36,133
That's the good part, I guess.
You get to go find a new dream.

Yes, of course. I just...

752
01:10:58,997 --> 01:11:01,291
I'm sorry. Everything is fine.

753
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:03,877
There's just something
I have to take care of.

754
01:11:06,797 --> 01:11:07,881
Okay.

755
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:11,384
I'll be right back.

756
01:11:17,599 --> 01:11:19,476
It's all right, Pascal.

757
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,735
There you are!

758
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:31,404
I've been searching everywhere
for you guys since we got separated.

759
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:35,742
The sideburns are coming in nice, huh?
Got to be excited about that.

760
01:11:39,454 --> 01:11:42,165
Anyhow, I just wanted to say
I shouldn't have split.

761
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:47,754
The crown is all yours. I'll miss you,
but I think it's for the best.

762
01:11:49,464 --> 01:11:52,801
Holding out on us again, eh, Rider?

763
01:11:53,301 --> 01:11:56,179
- What?
- We heard you found something.

764
01:11:56,304 --> 01:11:59,182
Something much more valuable
than a crown.

765
01:12:00,225 --> 01:12:02,978
We want her instead.

766
01:12:13,321 --> 01:12:16,491
I was starting to think you ran off
with the crown and left me.

767
01:12:23,623 --> 01:12:25,208
He did.

768
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:28,503
What? No. He wouldn't.

769
01:12:29,504 --> 01:12:31,131
See for yourself.

770
01:12:36,052 --> 01:12:37,137
Eugene?

771
01:12:39,848 --> 01:12:41,767
Eugene!

772
01:12:44,019 --> 01:12:48,982
A fair trade. A crown
for the girl with the magic hair.

773
01:12:50,192 --> 01:12:53,945
How much do you think someone would
pay to stay young and healthy forever?

774
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:56,990
No. Please. No!

775
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:07,834
Rapunzel!

776
01:13:09,628 --> 01:13:11,004
Mother?

777
01:13:15,884 --> 01:13:18,345
Oh, my precious girl!

778
01:13:19,304 --> 01:13:20,514
Mother.

779
01:13:21,056 --> 01:13:23,433
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

780
01:13:23,558 --> 01:13:27,062
- How did you...
- I was so worried about you, dear.

781
01:13:27,187 --> 01:13:30,690
So I followed you.
And I saw them attack you and...

782
01:13:30,816 --> 01:13:33,401
Oh, my. Let's go before they come to!

783
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:07,561
You were right, Mother.
You were right about everything.

784
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:12,107
I know, darling. I know.

785
01:14:25,996 --> 01:14:27,080
Look!

786
01:14:27,706 --> 01:14:29,040
The crown!

787
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:38,091
No! Wait, guys!

788
01:15:01,948 --> 01:15:03,992
Let's get this over with, Rider.

789
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:07,454
Where are we going?

790
01:15:15,337 --> 01:15:18,048
There. It never happened.

791
01:15:20,342 --> 01:15:25,180
Now, wash up for dinner.
I'm making hazelnut soup.

792
01:15:29,851 --> 01:15:34,981
I really did try, Rapunzel.
I tried to warn you what was out there.

793
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:40,112
The world is dark and selfish and cruel.

794
01:15:40,237 --> 01:15:43,198
If it finds
even the slightest ray of sunshine,

795
01:15:44,199 --> 01:15:45,909
it destroys it.

796
01:17:28,637 --> 01:17:30,806
How did you know about her?
Tell me, now!

797
01:17:30,931 --> 01:17:33,683
It wasn't us! It was the old lady!

798
01:17:33,809 --> 01:17:35,060
Old lady?

799
01:17:36,561 --> 01:17:38,688
Wait. No! Wait!

800
01:17:38,814 --> 01:17:41,650
You don't understand!
She's in trouble! Wait!

801
01:17:44,945 --> 01:17:46,696
What's going on up there?

802
01:17:50,909 --> 01:17:52,536
Are you all right?

803
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:55,413
I'm the lost princess.

804
01:17:56,123 --> 01:17:59,251
Please speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.

805
01:17:59,376 --> 01:18:03,964
I am the lost princess. Aren't I?

806
01:18:06,174 --> 01:18:08,385
Did I mumble, Mother?

807
01:18:09,594 --> 01:18:12,055
Or should I even call you that?

808
01:18:13,348 --> 01:18:16,143
Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?

809
01:18:16,268 --> 01:18:18,895
Why would you ask
such a ridiculous question?

810
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:22,482
It was you! It was all you!

811
01:18:24,609 --> 01:18:28,071
Everything I did was to protect you.

812
01:18:30,198 --> 01:18:35,203
I've spent my entire life hiding from
people who would use me for my power

813
01:18:36,288 --> 01:18:39,249
when I should have been hiding
from you!

814
01:18:39,374 --> 01:18:42,586
Where will you go?
He won't be there for you.

815
01:18:42,711 --> 01:18:44,588
<i>What did you do to him?</i>

816
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:48,341
<i>That criminal is to be hanged
for his crimes.</i>

817
01:18:49,426 --> 01:18:51,803
- No.
- Now, now, it's all right.

818
01:18:51,928 --> 01:18:56,516
Listen to me.
All of this is as it should be.

819
01:18:56,975 --> 01:19:00,437
No! You were wrong about the world.

820
01:19:01,021 --> 01:19:03,440
And you were wrong about me!

821
01:19:03,565 --> 01:19:07,611
And I will never
let you use my hair again!

822
01:19:16,745 --> 01:19:19,206
You want me to be the bad guy?

823
01:19:19,331 --> 01:19:23,126
Fine, now I'm the bad guy.

824
01:19:37,349 --> 01:19:38,892
What's this?

825
01:19:39,017 --> 01:19:40,811
Open up!

826
01:19:41,895 --> 01:19:43,897
- What's the password?
- What?

827
01:19:44,022 --> 01:19:46,233
- Nope.
- Open this door!

828
01:19:46,358 --> 01:19:48,110
Not even close!

829
01:19:48,318 --> 01:19:51,071
You have three seconds! One...

830
01:19:51,988 --> 01:19:53,365
Two...

831
01:19:55,283 --> 01:19:56,326
Three.

832
01:20:01,915 --> 01:20:04,126
Frying pans! Who knew, right?

833
01:20:33,655 --> 01:20:34,906
- Head down.
- Head down.

834
01:20:35,031 --> 01:20:36,074
- Arms in.
- Arms in.

835
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:37,826
- Knees apart.
- Knees apart. Knees apart?

836
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:40,829
Why do I need
to keep my knees apart...

837
01:20:49,087 --> 01:20:52,257
Max! You brought them here?

838
01:20:54,509 --> 01:20:55,552
Thank you.

839
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:59,514
No, really. Thank you.

840
01:21:01,516 --> 01:21:02,768
I feel maybe this whole time,

841
01:21:02,893 --> 01:21:04,770
we've just been misunderstanding
one another,

842
01:21:04,895 --> 01:21:06,605
and we're really just...

843
01:21:07,022 --> 01:21:08,273
You're right, we should go.

844
01:21:15,947 --> 01:21:16,948
Max?

845
01:21:30,712 --> 01:21:33,840
Okay, Max.
Let's see how fast you can run.

846
01:21:53,235 --> 01:21:54,361
Rapunzel?

847
01:21:56,404 --> 01:21:57,948
Rapunzel, let down your hair!

848
01:22:13,713 --> 01:22:16,591
Rapunzel,
I thought I'd never see you again.

849
01:22:24,766 --> 01:22:27,644
Now look what you've done, Rapunzel.

850
01:22:27,769 --> 01:22:32,065
Oh, don't worry, dear.
Our secret will die with him.

851
01:22:33,817 --> 01:22:35,402
And as for us...

852
01:22:36,778 --> 01:22:41,366
We are going where no one
will ever find you again.

853
01:22:47,497 --> 01:22:49,124
Rapunzel, really!

854
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,587
Enough already! Stop fighting me!

855
01:22:54,254 --> 01:22:56,256
No! I won't stop!

856
01:22:56,381 --> 01:22:59,551
For every minute of the rest of my life,
I will fight!

857
01:22:59,676 --> 01:23:03,513
I will never stop trying
to get away from you!

858
01:23:05,974 --> 01:23:10,479
But if you let me save him,
I will go with you.

859
01:23:11,271 --> 01:23:14,149
No! No, Rapunzel.

860
01:23:15,108 --> 01:23:18,320
I'll never run. I'll never try to escape.

861
01:23:18,445 --> 01:23:21,990
Just let me heal him
and you and I will be together,

862
01:23:22,115 --> 01:23:24,117
forever, just like you want.

863
01:23:24,242 --> 01:23:26,203
Everything will be the way it was.

864
01:23:27,537 --> 01:23:28,663
I promise.

865
01:23:29,623 --> 01:23:31,333
Just like you want.

866
01:23:34,377 --> 01:23:37,714
Just let me heal him.

867
01:23:43,303 --> 01:23:46,640
In case you get any ideas
about following us.

868
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:59,194
I'm so sorry.
Everything is going to be okay, though.

869
01:23:59,319 --> 01:24:00,362
No, Rapunzel.

870
01:24:00,487 --> 01:24:03,824
I promise. You have to trust me.
Come on. Just breathe.

871
01:24:03,949 --> 01:24:05,534
I can't let you do this.

872
01:24:06,243 --> 01:24:08,370
And I can't let you die.

873
01:24:08,912 --> 01:24:12,582
But if you do then you will die.

874
01:24:12,707 --> 01:24:16,378
Hey. It's going to be all right.

875
01:24:23,718 --> 01:24:24,803
Wait.

876
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:34,980
Eugene...

877
01:24:35,981 --> 01:24:37,065
No!

878
01:24:45,323 --> 01:24:48,910
What have you done?
What have you done?

879
01:25:27,824 --> 01:25:29,701
No, no, no. Eugene.

880
01:25:32,496 --> 01:25:36,792
No! Look at me. I'm right here.
Don't go. Stay with me.

881
01:25:37,459 --> 01:25:40,504

01:25:49,846 --> 01:25:51,723
You were my new dream.

885
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,770

Rapunzel?

892
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:48,006
Eugene?

893
01:27:50,092 --> 01:27:53,011
Did I ever tell you
I've got a thing for brunettes?

894
01:29:35,989 --> 01:29:39,242
<i>Well, you can imagine
what happened next.</i>

895
01:29:41,745 --> 01:29:45,290
<i>The kingdom rejoiced,
for their lost princess had returned.</i>

896
01:29:45,415 --> 01:29:50,045
<i>The party lasted an entire week, and
honestly I don't remember most of it.</i>

897
01:29:50,921 --> 01:29:52,714
<i>Dreams came true all over the place.</i>

898
01:29:52,839 --> 01:29:56,093
<i>That guy went on to become the most
famous concert pianist in the world,</i>

<i>if you can believe it!</i>

900
01:29:59,429 --> 01:30:02,808
<i>And this guy?
He eventually found true love.</i>

901
01:30:03,809 --> 01:30:07,938
<i>As for this guy, I assume he's happy.
He's never told me otherwise.</i>

902
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:11,233
<i>Thanks to Maximus,</i>

903
01:30:11,358 --> 01:30:14,402
<i>crime in the kingdom
disappeared almost overnight.</i>

904
01:30:15,987 --> 01:30:17,989
<i>As did most of the apples.</i>

905
01:30:19,783 --> 01:30:22,577
<i>Pascal never changed.</i>

906
01:30:26,748 --> 01:30:30,710
<i>At last Rapunzel was home.
And she finally had a real family.</i>

907
01:30:32,462 --> 01:30:35,048
<i>She was a princess worth waiting for.</i>

908

910
01:30:41,513 --> 01:30:44,599
<i>And, as for me,
I started going by Eugene again,</i>

911
01:30:44,724 --> 01:30:46,810
<i>stopped thieving
and turned it all around.</i>

912
01:30:46,935 --> 01:30:49,438
<i>But I know what the big question is.</i>

913
01:30:49,563 --> 01:30:51,690
<i>Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?</i>

914
01:30:51,815 --> 01:30:52,858
<i>I'm pleased to tell you</i>

915
01:30:52,983 --> 01:30:57,362
<i>that after years and years
of asking and asking and asking...</i>

916
01:30:59,489 --> 01:31:01,366
<i>I finally said yes.</i>

917
01:31:01,491 --> 01:31:05,704
<i>- Eugene.
- All right, I asked her.</i>

918
01:31:05,829 --> 01:31:08,290
<i>And we're living happily ever after.</i>

919
01:31:08,999 --> 01:31:10,417
<i>Yes, we are.</i>
