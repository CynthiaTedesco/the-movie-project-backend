1
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,709
Forensics finally released this.

2
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:13,239
What is it?

3
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:15,974
Personal effects
they recovered from Skyfall.

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,313
You've got a secret.

5
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:26,317
Something you can't tell anyone

6
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,404
because you don't trust anyone.

7
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:37,694
I always knew death

8
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:39,794
would wear a familiar face.

9
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:42,083
But not yours.

10
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:50,096
I was at a meeting recently
and your name came up.

11
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:53,929
I'm flattered
London is still talking about me.

12
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:56,473
It wasn't MI6.

13
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:04,085
You're a kite

14
00:01:04,335 --> 00:01:06,816
dancing in a hurricane, Mr Bond.

15
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:12,432
Welcome, James.

16
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:15,278
It's been a long time.

17
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:18,505
And finally

18
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:19,940
here we are.
