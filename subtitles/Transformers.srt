<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We know not where it comes from,</i></font>

3

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That is how our race was born.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>For a time, we lived in harmony,</i></font>

6
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:19,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but like all great power,

00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And so began the war,</i></font>

00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:27,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>a war that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death,</i></font>

9
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and the Cube was lost

10
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:39,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We scattered across the galaxy,

00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But we were already too late.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, 5 months of this.</font>

16
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't wait to get a little taste of home.</font>

00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets</font>

19
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the last 2 weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.</font>

20
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Bobby, Bobby, gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.</font>

21
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand.</font>

22
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">English, please. English.</font>

23
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.</font>

24
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why you got to ruin it for me, man?
That's my heritage.</font>

25
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go with the Spanish. Whatever.</font>

26
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.</font>

27
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
- Perfect day.</font>

28
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about you, Captain?
You got a perfect day?</font>

29
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't wait to hold my baby girl

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's adorable.
- That's too...</font>

31
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,454

33
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey!</font>

35
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch this crossover, baby.</font>

36
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Step aside, ladies.
- Oh, man. What?</font>

38
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lennox!
- Hey, what are you doing?</font>

39
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Water?
- Thank you.</font>

- I did, sir.</font>

91
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Epps, let's go!</font>

92
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.</font>

93
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.</font>

94
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch.</font>

95
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

96
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For my family...</font>

97
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:13,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who did... Who did that?
People! Responsibility.</font>

98
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

99
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, for my family genealogy report,</font>

100
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,</font>

101
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.</font>

102
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very famous explorer.</font>

103
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:35,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.</font>

104
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:43,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors
straight into the Arctic Shelf.</i></font>

105
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!</font>

106
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:53,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!</font>

107
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!</font>

108
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!</font>

109
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So that's the story, right?</font>

110
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools</font>

111
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">used by 19th-century seamen.</font>

112
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.</font>

113
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all for sale, by the way.</font>

114
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:18,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain.</font>

115
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.</font>

116
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they've seen many cool things.</font>

117
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you going to sell me his liver?</font>

118
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11th grade.</font>

119
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think your grandfather would be</font>

120
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">particularly proud of what you're doing.</font>

121
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.</font>

122
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take PayPal.</font>

123
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cold hard cash works, too.</font>

124
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.</font>

125
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sam!
- Sorry.</font>

126
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,</font>

127
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the genius that he was, wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,</font>

128
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">drawing these strange symbols</font>

129
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and babbling on about
some giant ice man</font>

130
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,346

131
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.</font>

132
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sleep in fear tonight.
- Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?</font>

133
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sam?
- Yeah. Sorry, sorry.</font>

134
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Pretty good, right?</font>

135
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd say a solid B.</font>

136
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A B-?</font>

your great-grandfather's crap</font>

- No, kids enjoy...</font>

139
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look, can you do me a favor?
- What?</font>

140
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?</font>

141
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's the guy in the green car.
- Yeah.</font>

142
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream.
A boy's dream.</font>

143
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And a man's promise to that boy.</font>

144
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He looked at me in the eye.
He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.</font>

145
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"But I want you to bring me $2,000
and 3 A's."</font>

146
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got 2 A's.</font>

147
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? Here's the dream. Your B.
Dream gone. Kaput.</font>

148
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?</font>

149
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Yes, yes.</font>

150
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So?</font>

151
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A. It's an A, though.</font>

152
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.</font>

153
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So I'm good?
- You're good.</font>

154
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got a little surprise for you, son.
- What kind of...</font>

155
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, a little surprise.</font>

156
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no, no, no. Dad!</font>

157
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, you got to be kidding me.
- See?</font>

158
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I am.
You're not getting a Porsche.</font>

159
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You think that's funny?
- Yeah, I think it's funny.</font>

160
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's wrong with you?
- You think I'd really get you</font>

161
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a Porsche for your first car?</font>

162
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.</font>

163
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
- It's not a funny joke.</font>

164
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Manny!
- What?</font>

165
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.</font>

166
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's having a heat stroke again.</font>

167
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scaring white folks.</font>

168
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.</font>

169
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said... You said half a car,</font>

170
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not half a piece of crap, Dad.</font>

171
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I was your age, I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.</font>

172
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?</font>

173
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin?
- Yeah.</i></font>

174
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.</font>

175
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- You want me to live that life?</font>

176
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No sacrifice, no victory.
- Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.</font>

177
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
- Right.</font>

178
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen.</font>

179
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.</font>

180
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I help you?</font>

181
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, my son here,
looking to buy his first car.</font>

182
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You come to see me?
- I had to.</font>

183
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.</font>

184
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sam.
- Sam, let me talk to you.</font>

185
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:21,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sam, your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.</font>

186
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you something, son.
A driver don't pick the car.</font>

187
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The car'll pick the driver.</font>

188
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.</font>

189
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.</font>

190
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!</font>

191
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be like that.
If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.</font>

192
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?</font>

193
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:52,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need.</font>

194
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This ain't bad.</font>

195
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This one's got racing stripes.
- Yeah.</font>

196
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It got racing...</font>

197
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?</font>

198
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know nothing about this car.</font>

199
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Manny!
- What?</font>

200
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this? This car! Check it out!</font>

201
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I don't know, boss! I've never seen it!
That's loco!</i></font>

202
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!</font>

203
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feels good.</font>

204
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How much?
- Well,</font>

205
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,</font>

206
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...</font>

207
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, but the paint's faded.
- Yeah, but it's custom.</font>

208
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's custom faded?</font>

209
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.</font>

210
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 5 grand.
- No, I'm not paying over 4. Sorry.</font>

211
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.</font>

212
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.</font>

213
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.</font>

214
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this one here
for 4 Gs is a beaut.</font>

215
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.</font>

216
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.</font>

217
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a classic engine right here.</font>

218
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sold a car the other day...</font>

219
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gee. Holy cow.</font>

220
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, no, no. No worries.
- You all right?</font>

221
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!</font>

222
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers</font>

223
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and come bang this stuff out, baby!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so underdressed.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defense.</font>

235
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please be seated.</font>

236
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm John Keller.</font>

237
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>At 1900 local time yesterday,</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>the SOCCENT Forward Operations
Base in Qatar was attacked.</i></font>

240
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So far as we know,
there were no survivors.</font>

241
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.</font>

242
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not sure
exactly what they're after,</font>

243
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,</font>

244
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:39,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.</font>

245
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.</font>

246
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound.</font>

247
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the signal
that hacked our network.</font>

248
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">NSA's working at full capacity

251
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,789

257
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck to us all.</font>

258
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Mojo. I got the car.
Now I need the girl.</font>

259
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need money to take out the girl
is what I need.</font>

260
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zero bids.</font>

261
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great. Broke.</font>

262
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Mojo.
You want your pain pills?</font>

263
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Premature.</font>

264
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. What's up?</font>

265
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing. You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.</font>

266
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like clockwork.</font>

267
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I know you get wasted
on these things,</font>

268
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but if you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?</font>

269
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.</font>

270
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:14,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ron, this one is uneven.
- Yeah. Probably.</font>

271
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one is wobbly.</font>

272
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
- Couldn't we have hired a professional?</font>

273
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sam...
- What?</font>

274
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not like footprints on my grass.</font>

275
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What foot... There's no footprints.
- That's why I built my path.</font>

276
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path, okay?</font>

277
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's family grass, Dad.
- Well, when you own your own grass,</font>

278
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- you'll understand.
- This... I can't do it anymore.</font>

279
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
- What?</font>

280
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom.</font>

281
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's his bling.</font>

282
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you home at 11:00!</font>

283
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, all right.
- 11:00!</font>

284
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, for the love of God, drive safely.</font>

285
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seat belt on!</font>

286
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. You are so cheap.</font>

287
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.</font>

288
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:10,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>At this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.</i></font>

289
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

290
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Our bases worldwide are, as of now,
at DEFCON Delta,</i></font>

291
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>our highest readiness level.</i></font>

292
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system</font>

293
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we have not come across before.</font>

294
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But our prayers are with the families
of the brave men and women...</i></font>

295
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.</font>

296
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen a weapons system
like this.</font>

297
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton</font>

298
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field.</font>

299
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields</font>

300
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">except in, like, comic book stuff, right?</font>

301
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Man, I don't know.
- What is that?</font>

302
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mama, she had the gift, you know?</font>

303
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She saw things. I got the gene, too,</font>

304
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.</font>

305
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about you use
those magic voodoo powers</font>

306
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and get us the hell out of here, huh?</font>

307
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.</font>

308
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looked right at me.</font>

309
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.</font>

310
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They got to know what
we're dealing with here.</font>

311
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My radio's fried.</i></font>

312
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- I got no communication with aerial.
- Hey, Mahfouz.</i></font>

313
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How far do you live from here?
- Not far. Just up that mountain.</font>

314
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do they have a phone?
- Yes.</font>

315
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's hit it.</font>

316
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?</font>

317
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.</font>

318
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

319
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird, all right?</font>

320
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm good, right?
- Yeah, you're good.</font>

321
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

322
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys, check it out.</font>

323
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hi.</font>

324
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:52,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.</font>

325
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what are you guys doing here?</font>

326
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here to climb this tree.</font>

327
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see that. It looks... It looks fun.</font>

328
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- You know, I thought I recognized you.</font>

329
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tried out for the football team
last year, right?</font>

330
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go call your mom.</font>

331
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, that... No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.</font>

332
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was researching a book I was writing.</font>

333
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.</font>

334
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?</font>

335
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:28,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.</font>

336
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.</font>

337
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little coloring areas,</font>

338
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.</font>

339
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's funny.</font>

340
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.</font>

341
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.</font>

342
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...</font>

343
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get out of the tree
right now, please.</font>

344
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

345
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.</font>

346
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.</font>

347
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, how about you let me drive?
- Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.</font>

348
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These 22's, I don't want you
grinding them. No.</font>

349
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?</font>

350
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.</font>

351
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

352
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll call me.</font>

353
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?</i></font>

354
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, man, what's wrong
with your radio?</font>

355
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
- What?</font>

356
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.</font>

357
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.</font>

358
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got to be understanding
here, all right?</font>

359
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.</font>

360
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
- I called shotgun.</font>

361
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.</font>

362
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's a party foul.
- What rules?</font>

363
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bros before hos.</font>

364
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, I'm begging you to get out
of my car. Okay?</font>

365
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't do this to me.</font>

366
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got to get out of my car right now.</font>

367
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Who's gonna come around
when you break?</i></font>

368
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mikaela! It's Sam.</font>

369
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Witwicky.</font>

370
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope I didn't get you
stranded or anything.</font>

371
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure?</font>

372
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, listen, I was wondering
if I could ride you home.</font>

373
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:09,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.</font>

374
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go.</font>

375
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

376
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe that I'm here right now.</font>

377
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can duck down if you want.
I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.</font>

378
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean here with you.</font>

379
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:37,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just meant here, like, in this situation,
this same situation that I'm always in.</font>

380
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys,</font>

381
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for tight abs and really big arms.</font>

382
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big arms?</font>

383
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there's a couple new additions
in the car.</font>

384
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, I just put in that light there.</font>

385
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that disco ball. And so the light
reflects off the disco ball.</font>

386
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:00,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

387
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?</font>

388
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no.</font>

389
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been in the same school
since first grade.</font>

390
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- Yeah.</font>

391
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, a long time.</font>

392
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, do we have any classes together?</font>

393
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, yeah.
- Really? Which?</font>

394
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">History. Language arts. Math. Science.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sam.
- Sam. Yeah.</font>

396
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sam Wilkicky.
- Witwicky.</font>

397
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, you know what? I'm so sorry.
I just...</font>

that's understandable.</font>

401
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.</font>

406
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I wouldn't try this on you.</font>

407
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.</font>

408
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.</font>

409
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, of course not.
- I'm a friend of yours.</font>

410
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.</font>

411
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,627

double-pump carburetor.</font>

417
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's pretty impressive, Sam.</font>

418

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Double-pump?</font>

419
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It squirts the fuel in
so you can go faster.</font>

420
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like to go faster.</font>

421

your distributor cap's a little loose.</font>

422
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? How'd you know that?</font>

423
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:40,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dad. He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.</font>

424
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:43,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could take it all apart, clean it,

I don't really broadcast it.</font>

more about cars than they do.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.</font>

433
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks.
- You know, I was thinking.</font>

434

437
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

438
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walking's healthy, right?</font>

439
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.</font>

440

So, you know, thanks for listening.</font>

451
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,184

<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

458
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,281

It would have done that already.</font>

811
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?</font>

812

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

821
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:48,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.</font>

a space rock?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like,
a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?</font>

902
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close to it. It melts tank armor.</font>

903
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.</font>

904
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Heads up!
- Oh!</font>

905
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!</font>

906
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strap it down! Strap it!
This thing is wicked.</font>

907
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command.</font>

908
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:20,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.</font>

909
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.</font>

910
01:07:27,572 --> 01:07:29,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want that piece?</font>

911
01:07:29,374 --> 01:07:32,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen.</font>

912
01:07:32,778 --> 01:07:34,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.</font>

913
01:07:34,946 --> 01:07:38,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why I ate their food.</font>

914
01:07:38,383 --> 01:07:40,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.</font>

915
01:07:41,052 --> 01:07:43,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't touch it, you're guilty.</font>

916
01:07:43,622 --> 01:07:47,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?</font>

917
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:48,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me and you.</font>

918
01:07:48,827 --> 01:07:51,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.</font>

919
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:08,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?</font>

920
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:10,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,</font>

921
01:08:10,582 --> 01:08:12,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.</font>

922
01:08:12,684 --> 01:08:13,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And then...
- Glen, you freak.</font>

923
01:08:13,752 --> 01:08:15,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!</font>

924
01:08:16,087 --> 01:08:20,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.</font>

925
01:08:20,892 --> 01:08:21,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so what?</font>

926
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.</font>

927
01:08:24,162 --> 01:08:25,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who hasn't? Who hasn't?</font>

928
01:08:25,964 --> 01:08:26,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I promise!
- Glen, shut up!</font>

929
01:08:27,032 --> 01:08:30,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!</font>

930
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:35,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, sugar rush.
- This is... This is not his fault.</font>

931
01:08:35,373 --> 01:08:36,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? So can I go home now?</font>

932
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:39,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, okay. I won't.
- But just listen to me.</font>

933
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:43,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?</font>

934
01:08:43,215 --> 01:08:45,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was something about
someone named Witwicky</font>

935
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:49,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and some government group, right?
Named Sector 7.</font>

936
01:08:49,354 --> 01:08:51,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller</font>

937
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:53,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before you go to war
with the wrong country!</font>

938
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:56,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Whatever fell out of the sky
ended up right behind...</i></font>

939
01:08:56,528 --> 01:08:58,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did he say?
- What?</font>

940
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did he hear it, too?
- Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.</font>

941
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:02,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What does he think it is?
- He thinks it's a military experiment.</font>

942
01:09:02,467 --> 01:09:03,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What a knucklehead.
- Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.</font>

943
01:09:09,241 --> 01:09:11,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Still no official word as to
what happened. You can see...</i></font>

944
01:09:11,176 --> 01:09:12,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Yeah!
- Call Sam.</i></font>

945
01:09:12,477 --> 01:09:14,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. Why?
- He should be home in 15 minutes.</font>

946
01:09:14,145 --> 01:09:15,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.</font>

947
01:09:15,547 --> 01:09:18,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him.</font>

948
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:19,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I can't ground him
if he's not late, can I?</font>

949
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to stay here, all right?</font>

950
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:27,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.</font>

951
01:09:27,893 --> 01:09:28,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, okay.
- All of them.</font>

952
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:29,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah, okay, okay.</font>

953
01:09:30,061 --> 01:09:31,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 minutes, all right?</font>

954
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:34,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks for staying on my path.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!</font>

955
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path.</font>

956
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:38,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?</font>

957
01:09:38,603 --> 01:09:40,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know, I buy half your car...
- Yeah.</font>

958
01:09:41,006 --> 01:09:44,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...then I bail you out of jail and then
I just decided to do all your chores.</font>

959
01:09:44,776 --> 01:09:46,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The chores.
- Yeah. Life is great, huh?</font>

960
01:09:46,444 --> 01:09:49,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.</font>

961
01:09:49,414 --> 01:09:51,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.</font>

962
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:53,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.</font>

963
01:09:53,285 --> 01:09:54,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.</font>

964
01:09:54,853 --> 01:09:56,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll do it.
- It would hurt my feelings if you do it.</font>

965
01:09:56,421 --> 01:09:57,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You sure? I don't mind, I don't...
- I promise...</font>

966
01:09:57,889 --> 01:09:59,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.</font>

967
01:09:59,224 --> 01:10:01,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill</font>

968
01:10:01,226 --> 01:10:05,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.</font>

969
01:10:05,196 --> 01:10:07,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tonight, right now?
- Right now.</font>

970
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:08,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The...</font>

971
01:10:10,602 --> 01:10:13,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you. God, I love you</font>

972
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:14,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just so much right now.</font>

973
01:10:15,006 --> 01:10:16,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
Mom wanted me to ground you.</font>

974
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:18,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're 3 minutes late.
- Right?</font>

975
01:10:18,176 --> 01:10:20,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, just another thing
you did for me, Dad,</font>

976
01:10:20,111 --> 01:10:21,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because you're such a swell guy.</font>

977
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:22,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One more thing, huh?</font>

978
01:10:22,814 --> 01:10:25,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!</font>

979
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:28,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?
What are you doing?</font>

980
01:10:28,219 --> 01:10:31,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the... Please, please, please.</font>

981
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:34,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!</font>

982
01:10:34,559 --> 01:10:36,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry. My bad.
- Oh, I... You couldn't...</font>

983
01:10:37,095 --> 01:10:39,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You couldn't wait for 5...
You couldn't wait for 5 minutes?</font>

984
01:10:39,164 --> 01:10:41,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!</font>

985
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:47,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I told you to watch them. I told you.
- Okay, you know what?</font>

986
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:51,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
- Oh, this is bad. No!</font>

987
01:10:52,677 --> 01:10:55,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!</font>

988
01:10:55,647 --> 01:10:58,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, wet.
- No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!</font>

989
01:10:58,283 --> 01:11:01,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.</font>

990
01:11:01,152 --> 01:11:03,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...</font>

991
01:11:04,055 --> 01:11:07,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Put the... Put them away. Please.
- You have a rodent infestation.</font>

992
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:08,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A what?
- Shall I terminate?</font>

993
01:11:08,426 --> 01:11:10,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no.
He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.</font>

994
01:11:10,695 --> 01:11:13,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?</font>

995
01:11:13,999 --> 01:11:16,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.</font>

996
01:11:18,203 --> 01:11:22,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
- Bad Mojo!</font>

997
01:11:22,474 --> 01:11:23,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.</font>

998
01:11:24,075 --> 01:11:25,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all it is.</font>

999
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:28,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My foot's gonna rust.
- All right.</font>

1000
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:30,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay.</font>

1001
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:34,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shut up and go hide!
- Just hurry.</font>

1002
01:11:37,989 --> 01:11:39,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Autobots, recon.</font>

1003
01:11:41,493 --> 01:11:44,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.</font>

1004
01:11:44,195 --> 01:11:45,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got some ice on his nose.</font>

1005
01:11:46,064 --> 01:11:48,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to slap him around a little bit.</font>

1006
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did not.</font>

1007
01:11:51,236 --> 01:11:53,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.</font>

1008
01:11:54,105 --> 01:11:56,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.</font>

1009
01:11:58,743 --> 01:12:00,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on.</font>

1010
01:12:05,183 --> 01:12:08,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What? What is this?
- Time is short.</font>

1011
01:12:08,386 --> 01:12:10,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They really want those glasses.
- Come on. What are you doing?</font>

1012
01:12:11,089 --> 01:12:12,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna help you.
- Okay.</font>

1013
01:12:12,857 --> 01:12:14,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please hurry.
- Okay.</font>

1014
01:12:16,227 --> 01:12:18,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
- What do you mean?</font>

1015
01:12:18,329 --> 01:12:19,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My glasses were in the bag.</font>

1016
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:21,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.</font>

1017
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:22,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?</font>

1018
01:12:23,068 --> 01:12:24,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what I think you should do is
you should...</font>

1019
01:12:24,235 --> 01:12:26,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should check this whole...
This whole section here.</font>

1020
01:12:26,538 --> 01:12:29,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.</font>

1021
01:12:29,574 --> 01:12:32,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...</font>

1022
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry. That's nothing.
- You just...</font>

1023
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:34,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You just told me to look...
- I know,</font>

1024
01:12:34,713 --> 01:12:36,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.</font>

1025
01:12:36,181 --> 01:12:38,877

so I don't get in trouble in your room.</font>

1026
01:12:38,983 --> 01:12:40,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm already stressed out enough.</font>

1027
01:12:41,019 --> 01:12:42,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. What now?</font>

1028
01:12:44,923 --> 01:12:48,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no. No, no, no.</font>

1029
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:52,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God. Oh!</font>

right here and now it's gone.</i></font>

Who's gonna pay for that?</i></font>

01:13:03,475 --> 01:13:06,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's back here.
- I can't deal with this. I can't...</font>

1035
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:08,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Oh, no, no, no.</font>

1036
01:13:08,213 --> 01:13:09,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is my mother's flower...
- Oops.</font>

1037
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,608

and see you, they're gonna freak out.</font>

1040
01:13:14,385 --> 01:13:15,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must have the glasses.</font>

1041
01:13:16,054 --> 01:13:17,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.</font>

1042

<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not here.
They're definitely not here.</font>

1043
01:13:20,058 --> 01:13:21,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep searching.</font>

1044
01:13:21,259 --> 01:13:22,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to be quiet for 5 minutes.</font>

1045

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, I'm begging you. You got to...
You're making a racket.</font>

01:13:26,231 --> 01:13:28,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing...</font>

1048
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:29,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calm down, calm down.</font>

1049

You got to do something here.</font>

01:13:31,269 --> 01:13:33,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Autobots, fall back.
- Thank you. Please, for 5 minutes.</font>

1051
01:13:34,038 --> 01:13:35,903

1052
01:13:36,007 --> 01:13:37,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Move!
- Get away!</font>

1053

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?</font>

move! Earthquake!</font>

Duck and cover right now!</font>

1057
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:54,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get over there so fast?</font>

1058
01:13:55,593 --> 01:13:57,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! That was tingly!</font>

1059
01:13:57,996 --> 01:14:00,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got to try that!
- Yeah, that looks fun.</font>

1060

- Sammy?</font>

- That's weird.</font>

01:14:15,511 --> 01:14:17,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sam!
- Ratchet, point the light.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, hurry.
- Listen, we got a major issue in here.</font>

1065
01:14:19,982 --> 01:14:21,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.</font>

1066
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:23,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.</font>

1067
01:14:23,152 --> 01:14:24,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shut it off.
- Sam, are you in there?</font>

1068
01:14:24,419 --> 01:14:25,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How come the door's locked?</font>

1069
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:29,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!</font>

1070
01:14:29,324 --> 01:14:30,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know he'll start counting</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, dear.</font>

1073
01:14:33,228 --> 01:14:34,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 4. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
- He's counting!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sam, just open the door.
- 3.</font>

- 2.</font>

1076
01:14:37,633 --> 01:14:39,692

- Stand back.</font>

1077
01:14:40,202 --> 01:14:43,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's up? What's with the bat?
- Who were you talking to?</font>

1078
01:14:43,972 --> 01:14:46,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?</font>

1079
01:14:47,075 --> 01:14:48,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.</font>

1080
01:14:48,777 --> 01:14:51,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...</font>

1081
01:14:51,113 --> 01:14:52,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?</font>

1082
01:14:53,081 --> 01:14:54,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!</font>

1083
01:14:54,983 --> 01:14:56,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.</font>

1084
01:14:56,585 --> 01:14:57,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Maybe it bounced...
- There was light under the door.</font>

1085
01:14:57,953 --> 01:14:59,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.</font>

1086
01:15:00,088 --> 01:15:01,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got to knock.
You got to communicate.</font>

1087
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:02,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We knocked for 5 minutes.
- I'm a teenager.</font>

1088
01:15:02,691 --> 01:15:04,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We knocked.
- You didn't knock.</font>

1089
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You were screaming at me, okay?
- No.</font>

1090
01:15:05,727 --> 01:15:07,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is repression,
what you're doing here.</font>

1091
01:15:07,262 --> 01:15:09,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're ruining my youth, okay?
- Oh, for Pete's sakes!</font>

1092
01:15:09,731 --> 01:15:14,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?</font>

1093
01:15:16,071 --> 01:15:17,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Judy.
- Was I...</font>

1094
01:15:17,239 --> 01:15:18,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Mom.
- Zip it, okay?</font>

1095
01:15:18,307 --> 01:15:19,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's okay.
- No, I don't masturbate!</font>

1096
01:15:19,741 --> 01:15:20,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not something for you
to bring up.</font>

1097
01:15:20,876 --> 01:15:22,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's a father-and-son thing, okay?
- Father-son thing.</font>

1098
01:15:22,511 --> 01:15:25,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.</font>

1099
01:15:25,447 --> 01:15:29,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can call it Sam's happy time or...</font>

1100
01:15:29,184 --> 01:15:31,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Happy time?
- ...my special alone time...</font>

1101
01:15:31,286 --> 01:15:32,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop.
- Mom.</font>

1102
01:15:32,354 --> 01:15:33,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Judy, stop.
- ...with myself.</font>

1103
01:15:33,455 --> 01:15:34,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom, you can't come in and...
- I'm sorry.</font>

1104
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:36,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.</font>

1105
01:15:36,992 --> 01:15:39,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, no, Dad.
- Yeah, well, we saw a light.</font>

1106
01:15:39,127 --> 01:15:40,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, parents.</font>

1107
01:15:41,797 --> 01:15:44,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know where it was, but we saw it.</font>

1108
01:15:45,734 --> 01:15:49,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Earthquake! It's another one! Another
earthquake! Get in the doorway!</font>

1109
01:15:49,404 --> 01:15:52,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!</font>

1110
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I hate these.</font>

1111
01:15:53,242 --> 01:15:54,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
- Quick, hide.</font>

1112
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:55,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, the lights are back on.
- Hide? What?</font>

1113
01:15:55,744 --> 01:15:57,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where?
- Come on, get out of that tub.</font>

1114
01:15:57,379 --> 01:15:58,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't you take safety seriously?</font>

1115
01:15:58,814 --> 01:16:02,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
- Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.</font>

1116
01:16:02,184 --> 01:16:05,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.</font>

1117
01:16:10,192 --> 01:16:13,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!</font>

1118
01:16:13,795 --> 01:16:16,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power pole's sparking all over
the place!</font>

1119
01:16:16,398 --> 01:16:18,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man. Yard's a waste.</font>

1120
01:16:18,734 --> 01:16:20,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trashed. Gone.</font>

1121
01:16:20,736 --> 01:16:22,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's a wash. The whole yard.
- You're kidding.</font>

1122
01:16:22,304 --> 01:16:24,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The parents are very irritating.</font>

1123
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:26,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can I take them out?</font>

1124
01:16:26,241 --> 01:16:28,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.</font>

1125
01:16:29,077 --> 01:16:30,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is with you?</font>

1126
01:16:30,379 --> 01:16:33,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.</font>

1127
01:16:33,815 --> 01:16:35,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We heard you talking
to somebody, Sam.</font>

1128
01:16:35,584 --> 01:16:37,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We wanna know who.
- Mom, I told...</font>

1129
01:16:38,086 --> 01:16:39,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. I'm Mikaela.</font>

1130
01:16:40,656 --> 01:16:42,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.</font>

1131
01:16:44,393 --> 01:16:47,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?</font>

1132
01:16:47,229 --> 01:16:50,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She can hear you talking, Mom.
- Thank you.</font>

1133
01:16:50,198 --> 01:16:53,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...</font>

1134
01:16:53,368 --> 01:16:54,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry that we're bugging you.
- Do you have my backpack?</font>

1135
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:56,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, hon. Let's go.
- Oh, it's in the kitchen.</font>

1136
01:17:13,488 --> 01:17:16,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.</font>

1137
01:17:16,925 --> 01:17:18,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Your mom's so nice.</font>

1138
01:17:19,027 --> 01:17:19,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to distract my parents</font>

1139
01:17:20,095 --> 01:17:22,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while I slip out and get these glasses
to them, okay?</font>

1140
01:17:28,337 --> 01:17:30,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ronald Wickity?
- It's Witwicky. Who are you?</font>

1141
01:17:31,006 --> 01:17:33,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're the government. Sector 7.</font>

1142
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:35,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Never heard of it.
- Never will.</font>

1143
01:17:35,377 --> 01:17:37,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?</font>

1144
01:17:38,013 --> 01:17:39,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Witwicky.</font>

1145
01:17:39,247 --> 01:17:42,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I enter the premises, sir?</font>

1146
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:45,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.</font>

1147
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:46,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the heck is going on here?</font>

1148
01:17:46,688 --> 01:17:48,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.</font>

1149
01:17:48,924 --> 01:17:51,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We think it's involved in
a national security matter.</font>

1150
01:17:51,293 --> 01:17:52,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're ripping up my rose bushes!
- National security?</font>

1151
01:17:52,828 --> 01:17:53,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right. National security.</font>

1152
01:17:53,996 --> 01:17:55,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God, Ron, they're everywhere.</font>

1153
01:17:55,697 --> 01:17:58,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's guys in suits all around
the house! Look at this!</font>

1154
01:17:58,166 --> 01:17:59,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could you stay off the grass?</font>

1155
01:18:00,068 --> 01:18:01,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.</font>

1156
01:18:01,603 --> 01:18:03,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're pulling bushes out
of the ground!</font>

1157
01:18:03,338 --> 01:18:06,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good Lord! They've got to get
their hands off my bush!</font>

1158
01:18:06,675 --> 01:18:08,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Drop the bat, ma'am.
- Hey, hey, hey, that's my...</font>

1159
01:18:08,243 --> 01:18:09,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm carrying a loaded weapon.</font>

1160
01:18:09,678 --> 01:18:11,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden</font>

1161
01:18:11,113 --> 01:18:13,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!</font>

1162
01:18:13,382 --> 01:18:16,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?</font>

1163
01:18:16,518 --> 01:18:18,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No!
- What is this?</font>

1164
01:18:18,687 --> 01:18:21,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you doing, son?
Is your name Sam?</font>

1165
01:18:21,523 --> 01:18:22,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Well, I need you to come with us.</font>

1166
01:18:23,091 --> 01:18:24,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, way out of line.</font>

1167
01:18:24,426 --> 01:18:28,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.</font>

1168
01:18:28,563 --> 01:18:30,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're not taking my son.
- Really?</font>

1169
01:18:30,565 --> 01:18:31,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gonna try to get rough with us?</font>

1170
01:18:31,733 --> 01:18:32,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, but I'm gonna call the cops</font>

1171
01:18:33,035 --> 01:18:35,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because there's something fishy
going on around here.</font>

1172
01:18:35,337 --> 01:18:38,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. There's something a little fishy
about you, your son,</font>

1173
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:42,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.</font>

1174
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:44,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.</font>

1175
01:18:44,546 --> 01:18:47,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think direct contact.</font>

1176
01:18:52,554 --> 01:18:54,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Son?
- Yeah.</font>

1177
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:58,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Step forward, please.
- Just stand?</font>

1178
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:05,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">14 rads.</font>

1179
01:19:06,935 --> 01:19:08,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bingo! Tag them and bag them!</font>

1180
01:19:09,137 --> 01:19:11,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!</font>

1181
01:19:11,139 --> 01:19:12,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!</font>

1182
01:19:12,941 --> 01:19:14,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!</font>

1183
01:19:14,576 --> 01:19:16,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Not a word until we get a lawyer!</font>

1184
01:19:20,715 --> 01:19:21,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So,</font>

1185
01:19:23,318 --> 01:19:26,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">LadiesMan217.</font>

1186
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:30,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is your eBay username, right?</font>

1187
01:19:30,425 --> 01:19:32,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.</font>

1188
01:19:32,861 --> 01:19:33,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you make of this?</font>

1189
01:19:33,929 --> 01:19:36,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?
And my...</i></font>

1190
01:19:36,598 --> 01:19:37,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that you?</font>

1191
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:40,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.</font>

1192
01:19:40,135 --> 01:19:44,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last night at the station, you told
the officer your car transformed.</font>

1193
01:19:46,308 --> 01:19:48,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Enlighten me.
- Well, here's what I said, okay?</font>

1194
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:53,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...</font>

1195
01:19:53,315 --> 01:19:55,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- ...from me, from my home,</font>

1196
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:58,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!</font>

1197
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.</font>

1198
01:20:00,455 --> 01:20:03,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.</font>

1199
01:20:07,028 --> 01:20:08,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's funny. That is so funny.</font>

1200
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:11,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what do you kids know
about aliens, huh?</font>

1201
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, E.T.? No.</i></font>

1202
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:16,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah.</font>

1203
01:20:16,872 --> 01:20:17,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see this?</font>

1204
01:20:18,106 --> 01:20:20,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is an I-can-do-whatever-I-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.</font>

1205
01:20:20,809 --> 01:20:23,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right.
- I'm gonna lock you up forever.</font>

1206
01:20:23,678 --> 01:20:24,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.</font>

1207
01:20:25,013 --> 01:20:27,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall.</font>

1208
01:20:27,516 --> 01:20:30,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, in the training bra, do not test me.</font>

1209
01:20:30,685 --> 01:20:32,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially with your daddy's parole
coming up.</font>

1210
01:20:32,888 --> 01:20:34,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Parole?</font>

1211
01:20:34,389 --> 01:20:37,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's nothing.
- Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?</font>

1212
01:20:37,826 --> 01:20:39,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?</font>

1213
01:20:39,928 --> 01:20:41,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they... They weren't always his.</font>

1214
01:20:41,763 --> 01:20:42,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stole cars?</font>

1215
01:20:42,964 --> 01:20:44,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we couldn't always afford
a babysitter,</font>

1216
01:20:44,766 --> 01:20:46,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so sometimes he had to take me along.</font>

1217
01:20:46,668 --> 01:20:48,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!</font>

1218
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:51,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.</font>

1219
01:20:52,841 --> 01:20:57,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.</font>

1220
01:20:57,579 --> 01:20:59,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is time to talk!</font>

1221
01:21:06,621 --> 01:21:08,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big! It's big!</font>

1222
01:21:12,794 --> 01:21:14,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go, go!</font>

1223
01:21:15,197 --> 01:21:17,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- Shift your weight towards the front!</font>

1224
01:21:17,933 --> 01:21:19,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right! All right!</font>

1225
01:21:33,949 --> 01:21:36,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You A-holes are in trouble now.</font>

1226
01:21:36,351 --> 01:21:42,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen, I want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.</font>

1227
01:21:45,126 --> 01:21:48,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taking the children was a bad move.</font>

1228
01:21:48,997 --> 01:21:52,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.</font>

1229
01:21:56,004 --> 01:21:57,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freeze!</font>

1230
01:21:58,373 --> 01:21:59,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Whoa! Whoa!
- Give me those!</font>

1231
01:21:59,874 --> 01:22:00,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

1232
01:22:02,377 --> 01:22:03,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

1233
01:22:14,222 --> 01:22:15,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, there.</font>

1234
01:22:15,857 --> 01:22:20,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?</font>

1235
01:22:21,296 --> 01:22:26,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, there are
Seven protocols, okay?</font>

1236
01:22:26,835 --> 01:22:28,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not authorized
to communicate with you</font>

1237
01:22:28,236 --> 01:22:30,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">except to tell you
I can't communicate with you.</font>

1238
01:22:30,572 --> 01:22:33,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get out of the car.
- All right.</font>

1239
01:22:33,808 --> 01:22:34,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Me? You want me to get...
- Now!</font>

1240
01:22:35,043 --> 01:22:36,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, all right. Get out. Hey.</font>

1241
01:22:36,645 --> 01:22:40,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I'm... I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?</font>

1242
01:22:40,115 --> 01:22:43,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.</font>

1243
01:22:43,718 --> 01:22:45,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're good with handcuffs, too,
now, huh?</font>

1244
01:22:45,353 --> 01:22:46,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you doing?</font>

1245
01:22:46,454 --> 01:22:48,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You weren't supposed to hear all that.
- How's it going, huh?</font>

1246
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:50,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- This is real.</font>

1247
01:22:50,558 --> 01:22:53,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, listen. If I choose to engage
with him, mum is the word, all right?</font>

1248
01:22:53,828 --> 01:22:57,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sam, I have a record
because I wouldn't turn my dad in.</font>

1249
01:22:58,199 --> 01:23:02,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?</font>

1250
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:05,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?</font>

1251
01:23:05,707 --> 01:23:08,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is Sector 7? Answer me.</font>

1252
01:23:08,677 --> 01:23:11,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you, young man!</font>

1253
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:13,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How'd you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?</font>

1254
01:23:13,615 --> 01:23:15,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am not at liberty to discuss it.
- No?</font>

1255
01:23:15,717 --> 01:23:17,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.</font>

1256
01:23:17,686 --> 01:23:19,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?</font>

1257
01:23:19,521 --> 01:23:22,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with
his big alien friend standing over there.</font>

1258
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:25,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where is Sector 7?
- Wouldn't you like to know?</font>

1259
01:23:30,932 --> 01:23:31,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1260
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.</font>

1261
01:23:35,036 --> 01:23:37,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get that thing to stop, huh?</font>

1262
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right, tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?</font>

1263
01:23:41,843 --> 01:23:44,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?</font>

1264
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For threatening my dad.</font>

1265
01:23:50,685 --> 01:23:56,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little lady, this is the beginning
of the end of your life.</font>

1266
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a criminal.</font>

1267
01:24:00,695 --> 01:24:03,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.</font>

1268
01:24:04,966 --> 01:24:07,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.</font>

1269
01:24:07,902 --> 01:24:08,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1270
01:24:09,003 --> 01:24:11,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is such a felony, what you're doing.</font>

1271
01:24:13,141 --> 01:24:15,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I will hunt you down, okay?
- He'll hunt you down.</font>

1272
01:24:15,176 --> 01:24:17,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Without any remorse!
- No remorse.</font>

1273
01:24:17,445 --> 01:24:18,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Enjoy.
- Okay?</font>

1274

1398
01:34:53,748 --> 01:34:58,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If all else fails, I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.</font>

1399
01:34:58,419 --> 01:34:59,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's suicide.</font>

1400
01:34:59,854 --> 01:35:03,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.</font>

1401
01:35:03,758 --> 01:35:08,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.</font>

1402
01:35:08,329 --> 01:35:11,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.</font>

1403
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been an honor serving with you all.</font>

1404
01:35:15,903 --> 01:35:19,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Autobots, roll out!
- We rolling!</font>

1405
01:35:31,752 --> 01:35:34,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Team attention! Present arms!</font>

1406
01:35:35,589 --> 01:35:39,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At ease. Captain, Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.</font>

1407
01:35:39,927 --> 01:35:41,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?</font>

1408
01:35:41,729 --> 01:35:43,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.</font>

1409
01:35:43,964 --> 01:35:45,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If they hit us again,
we'll be ready for them.</font>

1410
01:35:45,332 --> 01:35:48,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.</font>

1411
01:35:49,937 --> 01:35:51,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, kid.</font>

1412
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:54,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we got off to a bad start, huh?</font>

1413
01:35:55,443 --> 01:35:56,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must be hungry?</font>

1414
01:35:56,644 --> 01:35:58,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?</font>

1415
01:35:58,746 --> 01:36:00,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my car?</font>

1416
01:36:00,481 --> 01:36:04,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son, I need you to listen to me
very carefully.</font>

1417
01:36:04,552 --> 01:36:06,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People can die here.</font>

1418
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:09,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.</font>

1419
01:36:09,423 --> 01:36:10,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1420
01:36:10,724 --> 01:36:14,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.</font>

1421
01:36:14,562 --> 01:36:19,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.</font>

1422
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:23,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.</font>

1423
01:36:23,971 --> 01:36:25,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1424
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:28,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The man's an extortionist.</font>

1425
01:36:30,211 --> 01:36:31,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, here's the situation.</font>

1426
01:36:31,645 --> 01:36:34,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.</font>

1427
01:36:34,148 --> 01:36:35,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">NBEs?</font>

1428
01:36:35,349 --> 01:36:38,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.</font>

1429
01:36:39,053 --> 01:36:42,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you're about to see
is totally classified.</font>

1430
01:36:51,866 --> 01:36:53,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dear God. What is this?</font>

1431
01:36:55,269 --> 01:36:58,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We think when he made his approach
over the north pole,</font>

1432
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:02,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.</font>

1433
01:37:02,176 --> 01:37:06,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.</font>

1434
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:09,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.</font>

1435
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:12,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We call him NBE One.</font>

1436
01:37:12,153 --> 01:37:14,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,</font>

1437
01:37:14,622 --> 01:37:17,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but, I mean, that's Megatron.</font>

1438
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:20,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's the leader of the Decepticons.</font>

1439
01:37:20,227 --> 01:37:23,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's been in cryostasis since 1935.</font>

1440
01:37:23,664 --> 01:37:27,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries</font>

1441
01:37:27,234 --> 01:37:28,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the history of mankind.</font>

1442
01:37:28,769 --> 01:37:31,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,</font>

1443
01:37:31,805 --> 01:37:38,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him.</font>

1444
01:37:38,746 --> 01:37:42,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">NBE One. That's what we call it.</font>

1445
01:37:43,117 --> 01:37:45,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know</font>

1446
01:37:45,853 --> 01:37:48,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?</font>

1447
01:37:48,322 --> 01:37:52,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.</font>

1448
01:37:52,426 --> 01:37:54,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you got one now.</font>

1449
01:37:55,229 --> 01:37:57,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So why Earth?
- It's the All Spark.</font>

1450
01:37:57,731 --> 01:37:59,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All Spark? What is that?</font>

1451
01:37:59,366 --> 01:38:01,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, yeah, they came here looking
for some sort of cube-looking thing.</font>

1452
01:38:02,036 --> 01:38:06,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA
Megatron, that's what they call him,</font>

1453
01:38:06,907 --> 01:38:09,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who's pretty much the harbinger
of death, wants to use the Cube</font>

1454
01:38:09,443 --> 01:38:12,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to transform human technology
to take over the universe.</font>

1455
01:38:12,646 --> 01:38:14,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's their plan.</font>

1456
01:38:14,281 --> 01:38:16,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And you're sure about that?
- Yeah.</font>

1457
01:38:19,019 --> 01:38:21,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys know where it is, don't you?</font>

1458
01:38:22,723 --> 01:38:23,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

1459
01:38:27,494 --> 01:38:29,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're about to see our crown jewel.</font>

1460
01:38:38,939 --> 01:38:42,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.</font>

1461
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:47,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.</font>

1462
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:51,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube</font>

1463
01:38:51,852 --> 01:38:53,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as well as NBE One.</font>

1464
01:38:53,487 --> 01:38:56,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">President Hoover had the dam built
around it.</font>

1465
01:38:56,156 --> 01:38:58,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 football fields thick of concrete.</font>

1466
01:38:58,626 --> 01:39:01,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone</font>

1467
01:39:02,062 --> 01:39:05,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or any alien species on the outside.</font>

1468
01:39:44,471 --> 01:39:48,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.</font>

1469
01:39:48,909 --> 01:39:51,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What kind exactly?
- Good question.</font>

1470
01:39:55,983 --> 01:39:58,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.</font>

1471
01:40:04,758 --> 01:40:06,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wow.</font>

1472
01:40:06,527 --> 01:40:08,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?</font>

1473
01:40:08,662 --> 01:40:09,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, man.</font>

1474
01:40:09,997 --> 01:40:14,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddy Krueger have 4 blades, man.
That's only 3. That's Wolverine!</font>

1475
01:40:14,568 --> 01:40:17,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right? That's Wolverine!
- That's very funny.</font>

1476
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:22,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?</font>

1477
01:40:22,176 --> 01:40:23,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a phone.</font>

1478
01:40:26,814 --> 01:40:29,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nokias are real nasty.</font>

1479
01:40:29,516 --> 01:40:33,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.</font>

1480
01:40:34,755 --> 01:40:36,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nokia's from Finland.</font>

1481
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:41,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.</font>

1482
01:40:44,331 --> 01:40:49,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.</font>

1483
01:41:03,584 --> 01:41:06,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mean little sucker, huh?
- That thing is freaky!</font>

1484
01:41:06,987 --> 01:41:10,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?</font>

1485
01:41:21,668 --> 01:41:23,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's breaking the box.</font>

1486
01:41:41,522 --> 01:41:42,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Go! Go!</font>

1487
01:41:42,756 --> 01:41:43,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move!</font>

1488
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:55,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.</font>

1489
01:41:55,803 --> 01:41:57,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Banachek. What's going on?</font>

1490
01:41:57,237 --> 01:41:59,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...</font>

1491
01:41:59,173 --> 01:42:00,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- What?
- ... and the backup generator</i></font>

1492
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:02,308

- Do you have an arms room?</i></font>

1493
01:42:08,715 --> 01:42:10,478

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll bring security to the...</font>

1495
01:42:12,085 --> 01:42:14,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get everyone to
the NBE One chamber now!</font>

1496

1498
01:42:17,891 --> 01:42:19,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're popping our generators!</font>

1499
01:42:31,672 --> 01:42:33,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Megatron melting!</font>

1500

on that table!</font>

1505
01:42:52,292 --> 01:42:56,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.</font>

1506
01:43:01,835 --> 01:43:04,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.</font>

with the Cube.</font>

1508

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You don't know.
- Maybe you know, but I don't know.</font>

1511
01:43:10,944 --> 01:43:12,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?</font>

1512
01:43:12,412 --> 01:43:14,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have people's lives at stake here,
young man.</font>

1516
01:43:23,891 --> 01:43:25,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop your weapon, soldier.</font>

01:43:28,228 --> 01:43:29,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, we didn't ask to be here.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are in your debt.</font>

1790
02:12:30,736 --> 02:12:33,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prime, we couldn't save him.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jazz.</font>

1792
02:12:38,510 --> 02:12:40,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We lost a great comrade</font>

1793
02:12:42,047 --> 02:12:43,912

02:12:44,182 --> 02:12:46,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, all of you.</font>

1795
02:12:46,818 --> 02:12:49,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You honor us with your bravery.</font>

1796
02:12:50,222 --> 02:12:52,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Permission to speak, sir?</font>

1797
02:12:52,691 --> 02:12:55,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Permission granted, old friend.</font>

1798
02:12:55,661 --> 02:12:57,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You speak now?</font>

1799
02:12:58,063 --> 02:13:00,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish to stay with the boy.</font>

1800
02:13:01,033 --> 02:13:02,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If that is his choice.</font>

1801
02:13:07,806 --> 02:13:08,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1802
02:13:29,494 --> 02:13:34,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen, the President has ordered
Sector 7 be terminated</font>

1803
02:13:34,766 --> 02:13:37,792

we live in a free land,</font>

1830
02:15:43,228 --> 02:15:44,855

1831
02:15:44,963 --> 02:15:47,056
