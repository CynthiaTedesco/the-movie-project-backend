How did you get two different kinds
of dinosaurs to, you know...

99
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,167
Oh, Indominus wasn't bred.
She was designed.

John Hammond entrusted me

"Spare no expense," he used to say.

of operating a theme park requires...

Don't forget why we
built this place, Claire.

but Asset Containment insisted
we build the walls up higher.

It began to anticipate
where the food would come from.

241

One of the handlers nearly lost an arm.

if I couldn't guarantee their safety.

For a dinosaur.

And that?

Why me?

484
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,521
I guess Mr. Masrani thinks,
since you're able to control the Raptors...

485
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,940
It's all about control with you.

486
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,249
I don't control the Raptors.
It's a relationship.

487
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,567
It's based on mutual respect.

488
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,762
That's why you and I never
had a second date.

489
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,660
Excuse me? I never wanted a second date.

490

Who prints out an itinerary
for a night out?

I'm an organized person.

492
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,020
What kind of a diet
doesn't allow tequila?

493
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,804
All of them, actually.

494
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,289
And what kind of a man shows up
to a date in board shorts?

495
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,442
- It's Central America. It's hot.
- Okay. Okay.

496
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,450
Can we just focus on the asset, please?

497
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,965
The asset?

498
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,820
Look, I get it.
You're in charge out here.

499
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,140
You gotta make a lot of tough decisions.

500
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,060
It's probably easier to pretend these
animals are just numbers on a spreadsheet.

501
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,845
But they're not. They're alive.

502
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,602
I'm fully aware they're alive.

503
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,405
You might have made them in a test tube,
but they don't know that.

504
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,722
They're thinking, "I gotta eat.

505
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,284
"I gotta hunt. I gotta..."

506
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,847
You can relate to at
least one of those things.

507
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,126
Right?

508
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,921
I'll be in the car.

509

510

Animals raised in isolation
aren't always the most functional.

Your Raptors are born in captivity.

551
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,420
With siblings. They learn social skills.

552
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,170
And I imprint on them when they're born.

There's trust.

554

The only positive relationship
this animal has is with that crane.

At least she knows that means food.

Nothing in Jurassic World is natural.

814

We have always filled gaps in the genome
