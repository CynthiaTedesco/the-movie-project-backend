1
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's happening!</font>

2
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait up, guys!</font>

3
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The baby's coming! The baby's coming!</font>

4
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Watch it!
- I'm having a baby!</font>

5
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Code Blue! Code Blue!
- Or pink if it's a girl!</font>

6
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Having a baby! Having a baby!
I'm coming, Ellie!</font>

7
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got it!</font>

8
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie! Ellie!</font>

9
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie, where are you? Where am I?</font>

10
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny?</font>

11
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you it was just a kick.</font>

12
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right! Right! Wow.</font>

13
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:19,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really gave Daddy a scare!
Daddy got silly!</font>

14
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy fall down cliff
and go boom, boom, boom.</font>

15
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Silly Daddy. Yeah.</font>

16
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:33,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, folks! False alarm!
It was just a kick!</font>

17
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know who I'd like to kick?
- That's the third false alarm this week.</font>

18
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, show's over, break it up!
Break it up!</font>

19
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see someone else
who has a bun in the oven!</font>

20
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not pregnant!</font>

21
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's too bad.
You'd make a wonderful mother!</font>

22
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny, I know you're excited. I am, too.
But you're getting a little carried away.</font>

23
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:02,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay!
Boy, you're starting to sound like Diego.</font>

24
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a second. Where is Diego?</font>

25
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My hooves are burning, baby!
They are burning!</font>

26
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this. I got to tip-toe!
I got to tip-toe!</font>

27
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat my dust, dingo!</font>

28
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now? Can I look now?</font>

29
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy. Don't freak out the baby.</font>

30
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:22,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The baby's fine. It's the freaked-out daddy
I'm worried about.</font>

31
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No peeking!</font>

32
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Voila! Playground for Junior!</font>

33
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wow.</i></font>

34
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's amazing!</font>

35
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny.</font>

36
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made it myself. Our family.</font>

37
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, why aren't I up there?</font>

38
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can be on ours.
- You'd fit right in!</font>

39
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks!</font>

40
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:15,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, it's still a work in progress.
A few rough edges here and there.</font>

41
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe it.
You're trying to baby-proof nature.</font>

42
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby-proof nature? Get out of here.
That's ridiculous.</font>

43
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny, this is the world our baby's
gonna grow up in.</font>

44
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:30,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't change that.</font>

45
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I can.
I'm the biggest thing on Earth!</font>

46
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:38,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Big Daddy. I can't wait to see
how you handle the teen years.</font>

47
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Sid!
I don't want you touching anything.</font>

48
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This place is for kids. Are you a kid?</font>

49
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't answer that.</font>

50
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diego! There you are.</font>

51
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You missed the big surprise!</font>

52
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Right. I'll check it out later.</font>

53
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. See you.</font>

54
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I think there's
something bothering Diego.</font>

55
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm sure everything's fine.</font>

56
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should talk to him.</font>

57
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys don't talk to guys
about guy problems.</font>

58
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just punch each other
on the shoulders.</font>

59
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's stupid.</font>

60
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:29,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To a girl. To a guy,
that's like 6 months of therapy.</font>

61
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay, I'm going.</font>

62
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

63
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why'd you do that?</font>

64
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

65
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, listen,</font>

66
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:53,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie thinks there's
something bothering you. I told her...</font>

67
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I've been thinking that soon</font>

68
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it might be time for me to head out.</font>

69
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:03,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. So I'll just tell her that you're fine.
It was nothing.</font>

70
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:07,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, who are we kidding, Manny?
I'm losing my edge.</font>

71
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not really built
for chaperoning play dates.</font>

72
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>

73
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Having a family, that's huge,
and I'm happy for you,</font>

74
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that's your adventure, not mine.</font>

75
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So you don't want to be around my kid?
- No, no, no. That's...</font>

76
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're taking this the wrong way.
- No, go.</font>

77
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go find some adventure,
Mr. Adventure Guy.</font>

78
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:31,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let my boring domestic life
hit you in the butt on the way out.</font>

79
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't Ellie supposed to be the one
with the hormonal imbalance?</font>

80
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny, wait! No one has to leave.</font>

81
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So?
- That's why guys don't talk to guys.</font>

82
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why? What happened?
- Diego's leaving.</font>

83
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:54,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This should be the best time of our lives.
We're having a baby!</font>

84
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Sid. They're having a baby.</font>

85
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but we're a herd, a family.</font>

86
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, things have changed.
Manny has other priorities now.</font>

87
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:11,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Face it, Sid. We had a great run,
but now it's time to move on.</font>

88
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it's just the two of us.</font>

89
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Sid, it's not the two of us.</font>

90
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crash and Eddie are coming with us?</font>

91
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just Crash?</font>

92
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just Eddie?</font>

93
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye, Sid.</font>

94
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, calm down. Calm down.</font>

95
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm good at making friends.
I'll make my own herd. That's what I'll do.</font>

96
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man...</font>

97
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, at least you still got your looks.</font>

98
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great.</font>

99
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody here? Anyone?</font>

100
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

101
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:01,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Poor guys. I know what it's like
to feel abandoned.</font>

102
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. You're not alone anymore.</font>

103
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go.</font>

104
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay. I'm okay, I'm okay.</font>

105
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay here. Stay here. And you,
you take care of your brother, now.</font>

106
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Momma's gonna be right back.</font>

107
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Momma's coming, baby!</font>

108
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotcha!</font>

109
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did I just tell you kids?</font>

110
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, thank you, thank you!</font>

111
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad egg. Rotten egg!</font>

112
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A heart attack you almost gave me!</font>

113
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, darling.
It's just that I love you so much.</font>

114
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I want you to meet
your Uncle Manny and your Aunt Ellie.</font>

115
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi!
- Hello.</font>

116
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:47,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to present Egbert, Shelly and Yoko.</font>

117
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sid, whatever you're doing, it's a bad idea.</font>

118
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My kids will hear you!</font>

119
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not your kids, Sid.
Take them back.</font>

120
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're not meant to be a parent.
- Why not?</font>

121
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First sign, stealing someone else's eggs.</font>

122
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Second sign, one of them
almost became an omelet.</font>

123
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sid, someone's probably
worried sick looking for them.</font>

124
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. They were underground, in ice.</font>

125
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:15,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it wasn't for me, they'd be Eggsicles.</font>

126
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sid, I know what you're going through.</font>

127
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna have a family, too, someday.</font>

128
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna meet a nice girl
with low standards,</font>

129
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no real options or sense of smell...</font>

130
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What Manny means to say is...</font>

131
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I get it. I'll take them back.</font>

132
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have your family,
and I'm better off alone, by myself.</font>

- No! No, it's okay. He'll bounce back.</font>

139
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's one of the advantages of being Sid.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think?</font>

143
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you would agree.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't cry! Don't cry.</font>

145
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll find a dry place.</font>

146
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:38,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

147
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, let me just dry you off.</font>

148
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,217

154
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here I am.</font>

155
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,089

159
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No. It's okay, it's okay. Don't cry.</font>

160
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you still crying? Are you hungry?</font>

161
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you're hungry.
I know just the thing.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no! Don't touch that!</font>

171
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are they?
- Who cares? They're fun!</font>

172

00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

190
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, come on. Spit him out.</font>

210
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you to take them back,
and you kept them!</font>

211
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now look what they've done!</font>

212
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, granted,
we do have some discipline issues.</font>

213
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eating kids is not a discipline issue!</font>

She's a dinosaur!</font>

This is gonna be dangerous!</font>

00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay close.</font>

268
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you guys
having the same dream I am?</font>

269
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:07,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been living above an entire world,
and we didn't even know it.</font>

270
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run for it! Hurry!</font>

271
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:44,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Diego, what are you doing here?
- Sightseeing!</font>

272
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:48,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm looking for Sid, same as you.
- Well! Aren't you noble?</font>

273
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not the time, guys!
We need all the help we can get!</font>

274
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind.</font>

275
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:17,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, boy! Here! Come on!
Good boy! Come on!</font>

276
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Climb on.
- Are you nuts?</font>

277
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not getting on that thing!</font>

278
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's either this dinosaur or that one!</font>

279
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:31,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pregnant lady wants to live!
Yabba-dabba-doo!</font>

280
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't ever yabba-dabba do that again!</font>

281
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:56,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I feel so puny.
- How do you think I feel?</font>

282
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take cover!</font>

283
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:13,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, you're awesome!
You're like the brother I never had!</font>

284
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, too!</font>

285
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we keep him?</font>

286
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Buck!
- What?</font>

287
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The name's Buck. Short for Buckminster.</font>

288
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Long for "Buh."</font>

289
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little dull.</font>

290
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

291
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Our friend was taken by a dinosaur.
- Well!</font>

292
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:54,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's dead. Welcome to my world.
Now go home.</font>

293
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Off you pop.
- Not without Sid.</font>

294
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie, wait.
Maybe the deranged hermit has a point.</font>

295
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny, we came this far,
we're gonna find him.</font>

296
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got tracks.</font>

297
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

298
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you go in there, you'll find your friend.</font>

299
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the afterlife.</font>

300
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know,
O Great and Wisely Weasely One?</font>

301
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

302
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:34,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy dinosaur carrying her three babies
and some floppy green thing.</font>

303
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we're friends
with the floppy green thing.</font>

304
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got all that from the tracks?</font>

305
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Not really.
I saw them come through here earlier.</font>

306
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's headed for Lava Falls.</font>

307
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's where they care for the newborns.</font>

308
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:51,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To get there, you've got to go
through the Jungle of Misery,</font>

309
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">across the Chasm of Death</font>

310
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the Plates of Woe.</font>

311
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:06,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay! Good luck with the slow
descent into madness.</font>

312
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna go now.</font>

313
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, you think this is
some sort of tropical getaway?</font>

314
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:17,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't protect your mate, mate.</font>

315
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you gonna do
with those flimsy tusks</font>

316
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you run into the beast?</font>

317
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I call him</font>

318
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rudy.</font>

319
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:32,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, good. Good. I was worried
it was something intimidating,</font>

320
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like "Sheldon" or "Tim."</font>

321
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:39,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. You mean there's something
bigger than Mommy Dinosaur?</font>

322
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Aye.</i>
- Eye?</font>

323
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:44,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aye, aye! He's the one that gave me this!</font>

324
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He gave you that patch?
- For free? That's so cool.</font>

325
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Maybe he'll give us one, too.</font>

326
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to my world.</font>

327
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abandon all hope, he who enters there!</font>

328
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right! We get it!</font>

329
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doom and despair, yada, yada, yada.</font>

330
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds like a jungle of misery to me.</font>

331
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hold on.
- Why? What's wrong? Peaches?</font>

332
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:47,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No! It's just I got a funny feeling.</font>

333
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're hungry! Low blood sugar.
There's some fruit!</font>

334
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No! Manny!
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.</font>

335
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't exactly your playground.</font>

336
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:02,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like I'm really gonna be afraid
of a pretty flower.</font>

337
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bet you didn't see that coming.</font>

338
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Manny!
- For the record, I blame you for this.</font>

339
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop eating our friends, plant!</font>

340
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it! I'm tearing it up from the roots!</font>

341
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:27,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do that, and it will clamp shut forever.
- What?</font>

342
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:30,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, preggers,
don't get your trunk in a knot.</font>

343
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll have them out of there
before they're digested.</font>

344
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Digested?</font>

345
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll be nothing but bones
in 3 minutes.</font>

346
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe 5 for the fat one.</font>

347
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not fat!</font>

348
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel tingly.</font>

349
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't say that
when you're pressed up against me.</font>

350
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that kind of tingly.</font>

351
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:48,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can feel it, too.</font>

352
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help! Someone help us!</font>

353
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry!</font>

354
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time to get...</font>

355
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buck Wild.</font>

356
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's fat now?</font>

357
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

358
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:14,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tourists.</font>

359
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Barfed on by a plant.</font>

360
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Awesome!
- Awesome!</font>

361
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say something.</font>

362
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for saving us.</font>

363
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buck, will you help us find
the floppy green thing?</font>

364
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's not necessary!
- Yes, it is.</font>

365
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I'll help you.</font>

366
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I got rules.</font>

367
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rule number 1, always listen to Buck.</font>

368
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:44,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rule number 2,
stay in the middle of the trail.</font>

369
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rule number 3,</font>

370
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he who has gas
travels at the back of the pack.</font>

371
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, then. Chop, chop!</font>

372
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should all have our heads examined.</font>

373
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's rule number 4!
Now let's go find your friend!</font>

374
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:30,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry.
We're gonna be fine.</font>

375
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please stop swaying. A little nauseous.</font>

376
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? She's putting us down...</font>

377
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:48,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! I'm too young to be eaten!</font>

378
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:55,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice mucus.
And I don't say that to everyone.</font>

379
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, families get complicated!
Maybe we can work something out.</font>

380
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can take them Sunday to Tuesday!</font>

381
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:17,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wednesday to Friday? Weekends?</font>

382
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay! Momma's okay.</font>

383
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:33,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you eat me, it will send a bad message.</font>

384
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Score one for the sloth!</font>

385
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the score's all tied up.</font>

386
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think the beast will find Sid?</font>

387
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or more importantly, us?</font>

388
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rudy? Are you joking?</font>

389
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:05,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's relentless.
He knows all, sees all, eats all.</font>

390
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So that's a yes.</font>

391
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:15,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Get off my lawn! Go on! Shoo!</font>

392
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew that guy when he was a caterpillar.</font>

393
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, before he came out.</font>

394
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're just living down here
by your wits,</font>

395
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all on your own, no responsibilities.</font>

396
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:35,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a one. It's incredible.
No dependents, no limits.</font>

397
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the greatest life
a single guy could have.</font>

398
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hear that? This is my kind of place.</font>

00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:42,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

400
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:44,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah... No, look, I can't talk right now.</font>

401
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. No, I'm trying to recover
a dead sloth.</font>

402
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

403
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, they're following me!</font>

404
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know! They think I'm crazy.</font>

405
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:57,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No... Okay, we're going
into the Chasm of Death.</font>

406
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm... I'm going to lose you.</font>

407
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I love you, too.</font>

408
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, good-bye. Good-bye! Good-bye.</font>

409
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay! Follow me.</font>

410
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's you in 3 weeks.</font>

411
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:28,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, why do they call it
the Chasm of Death?</font>

412
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:32,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we tried "Big Smelly Crack,"
but that just made everybody giggle.</font>

413
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, now what?</font>

414
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Madame.</i></font>

415
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She is not doing that!</font>

416
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rule number 1.</font>

417
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:52,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, mammoth!
You're supposed to have a good memory.</font>

418
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always listen to Buck.</font>

419
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:02,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, eyes forward, back straight, and...</font>

420
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes, breathe in the toxic fumes
and you'll probably die.</font>

421
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Toxic fumes?</font>

422
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:10,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just another day in paradise.
- Wait!</font>

423
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Geronimo!</font>

424
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ellie, you okay?
- You have to try this!</font>

425
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:30,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, now pile on, everyone!
Couldn't be easier!</font>

426
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:36,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't panic!</font>

427
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:39,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just some technical difficulties.</font>

428
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep holding it in, boys!</font>

429
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't take it anymore!</font>

430
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:49,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He breathed it!</font>

431
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now I'm breathing it!</font>

432
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! We're not dead!</font>

433
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sound ridiculous!</font>

434
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me? You should hear you!</font>

435
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, all right. And a one, and a two...</font>

436
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Christmas, Christmas time is here </i></font>

437
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:12,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop! Are you crazy?</font>

438
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not poison.</font>

439
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is so disturbing!</font>

440
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop laughing! All of you!</font>

441
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Stop laughing, all of you!"</font>

442
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"What's rule number 1?"</font>

443
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're just laughing.
What's so bad about that?</font>

444
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They died laughing!</font>

445
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop laughing!</font>

446
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what's funny, though?</font>

447
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:54,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're trying to save Sid,</font>

448
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now we're all gonna die!</font>

449
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:01,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And I don't even like Sid!
- Who does? He's an idiot!</font>

450
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:08,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for getting me into this mess.
It's the most fun I've had in years!</font>

451
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:12,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for deserting the herd!
That was totally super!</font>

452
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop that!</font>

453
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you see? We're all gonna die!</font>

454
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:32,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta do everything, huh?</font>

455
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:41,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes I wet my bed!</font>

456
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:44,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all right!
Sometimes I wet your bed!</font>

457
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:59,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure how much of that
you could hear.</font>

458
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:02,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I heard all of it.
- Right. Yeah.</font>

459
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:06,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You wet my bed?
- That was gas talk, dude.</font>

460
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, better get moving.</font>

461
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't we forgetting something?</font>

462
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:13,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy!</font>

463
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so lonely.</font>

464
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Here you go, guys.</font>

465
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? You're not gonna
eat your vegetables?</font>

466
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:51,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you gonna become
big, strong dinosaurs?</font>

467
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:00,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I've raised them vegetarian.
It's a healthier lifestyle.</font>

468
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, look at me.
I have the pelt of a much younger sloth.</font>

469
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me!
I'm trying to have a conversation here.</font>

470
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. That's not for us, kids.</font>

471
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's way too feathery and fleshy and...</font>

472
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And alive!</font>

473
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:35,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No, no, we do not eat
live animals, period!</font>

474
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, go! Fly!</font>

475
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be free,</font>

476
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:44,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">little flightless bird.</font>

477
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My bad.</font>

478
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:51,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where are you going?</font>

479
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is how you resolve conflict?</font>

480
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No wonder you're single!</font>

481
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Am I talking to myself here?</font>

482
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say, "They're vegetarian."
You say, "Grrr."</font>

483
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say, "Can we talk about talk this?"
You say, "Grrr."</font>

484
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't call that communication.</font>

485
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:12,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? That's your answer to everything.</font>

486
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:28,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you afraid of?
You're the biggest thing on Earth!</font>

487
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you?</font>

488
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:38,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

489
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:50,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll never survive.
It's dangerous by day.</font>

490
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:51,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's even worse at night.</font>

491
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:54,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus, their guide is a lunatic.</font>

492
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? You mean, Buck? He's wacko!</font>

493
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:57,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not!</font>

494
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Totally bonkers.</font>

495
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And his feet smell.</font>

496
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up! You shut up.</font>

497
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you little...</font>

498
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotcha!</font>

499
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's strangling his own foot.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shouldn't we get moving?
- What?</font>

501
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And give Rudy a midnight snack?
Not likely!</font>

502
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The skull's right.
Take a load off, mammals.</font>

503
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll camp here.</font>

504
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, who's hungry?</font>

505
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am!</font>

506
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't need the calories!</font>

507
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:30,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There I was, my back against the wall,
no way out,</font>

508

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Ellie, you should rest now.</font>

533
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life of the party.</font>

534
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:05,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, you guys get some shut-eye.
I'll keep watch.</font>

535
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:09,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, Buck. We got this.
Night time is possum time.</font>

536
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! We own the night, baby.</font>

537
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good night, Rudy.</font>

538
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait. What about me?</font>

539
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:01,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sleep well, kids!
We have a busy day tomorrow.</font>

540
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:03,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Foraging, hunting,</font>

541
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">missing my friends,</font>

542
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who probably aren't missing me.</font>

543
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a real softie, you know that?</font>

544
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny?</font>

545
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crash? Eddie?</font>

546
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:04,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny?</font>

547
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on? Are you okay?</font>

548
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I just wanted to keep you safe,</font>

549
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:33,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now you're in the most dangerous
place in the world.</font>

550
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. This isn't your fault.</font>

551
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:39,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's bigger than both of us.
We have to get Sid.</font>

552
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:43,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but if I had been
a better friend to him,</font>

553
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:46,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- we wouldn't be here.
- Better friend?</font>

554
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you plucking my whiskers?</font>

555
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:52,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You risked your life, your mate
and your baby to save your buddy.</font>

556
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:57,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not the best husband or father,
but a darn good friend!</font>

557
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

558
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:18,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody, stop!</font>

559
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:21,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I smell something.</font>

560
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:29,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It smells like a buzzard's butt fell off</font>

561
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:33,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then got sprayed on
by a bunch of skunks.</font>

562
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:34,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Sid.</font>

563
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:38,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mammals, we have ourselves
a crime scene.</font>

564
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:41,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A tuft of fur. Half-eaten carcass!</font>

565
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunk of... No!</font>

566
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Broccoli.</font>

567
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:48,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's what I think happened.</font>

568
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:50,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Dinosaur attacks Sid,</i></font>

569
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:54,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sid fights back with piece of broccoli,
leaving dinosaur</i></font>

570
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a vegetable.</font>

571
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you nuts? Sid's not violent.
Or coordinated.</font>

572
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. And where's the dinosaur?</font>

573
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. All right, good point.</font>

574
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Theory two.</font>

575
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sid's eating broccoli,</i></font>

576
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>dinosaur eats Sid,</i></font>

577
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>dinosaur steps on broccoli,
leaving broccoli</i></font>

578
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a vegetable.</font>

579
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:16,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buck, when exactly
did you lose your mind?</font>

580
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:18,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 months ago.</font>

581
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:20,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I woke up one morning
married to a pineapple.</font>

582
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:22,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An ugly pineapple.</font>

583
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I loved her.</font>

584
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buck, I think you missed
a little clue over here.</font>

585
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:33,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, your friend might be alive,
but not for long.</font>

586
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rudy's closing in.</font>

587
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Whoa!
- Whoa!</font>

588
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it. The Plates of Woe.</font>

589
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or whatever's left of them.</font>

590
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:57,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Single file, everyone! Head for Lava Falls.</font>

591
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:15,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's that sound?
- It's the wind. It's speaking to us.</font>

592
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's it saying?
- I don't know.</font>

593
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't speak Wind.</font>

594
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:32,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ellie!
- I'm fine. Don't worry about me.</font>

595
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just taking my...</font>

596
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie!</font>

597
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Manny!
- Get to the ledge!</font>

598
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie!</font>

599
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie! Where are you?</font>

600
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay! I'm up here!</font>

601
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:10,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on, Ellie! We'll be right there!</font>

602
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:34,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! Sloth down!</font>

603
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. Wait. Time out!</font>

604
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:44,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold up. You guys are getting fast!</font>

605
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:52,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not so bad down here.
Nice weather, friendly neighbors.</font>

606
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, neighbor.</font>

607
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Rudy.
- Rudy?</font>

608
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:11,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Never heard that kind of dino before.
- That's Sid!</font>

609
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:14,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We'll have to move fast.
- Manny! Pineapples!</font>

610
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:17,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pineapples?
- She gets cravings.</font>

611
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:20,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pomegranates? Grapefruits! Nectarines?</font>

612
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:22,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's ordering a fruit cocktail.</font>

613
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, think!</font>

614
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:26,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peaches!</font>

615
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peaches?</font>

616
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:32,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peaches! The baby! What, now?</font>

617
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:34,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This? Not good.</font>

618
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The baby's coming!
Did you guys hear that?</font>

619
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:37,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause sometimes
I imagine it in my head, but...</font>

620
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you try to hold it in?</font>

621
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:41,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can somebody slap him for me?</font>

622
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:44,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Done and done.</font>

623
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just sit tight. We're coming!</font>

624
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only one thing to do.
Possums, you're with me.</font>

625
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny, you take care of Ellie
until we get back.</font>

626
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No, you can't leave now!</font>

627
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:55,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's off the trail!
What about rule number 2?</font>

628
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:58,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rule number 5 says
you can ignore rule number 2</font>

629
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:01,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if there's a female involved,
or possibly a cute dog.</font>

630
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:03,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I just make up these rules
as I go along.</font>

631
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:07,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, but, but she's... You have to...
- Manny, it's all right.</font>

632
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got your back.</font>

633
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:14,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you're talking! Come on, lads.</font>

634
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:20,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take care of our sister, mister.
- No pressure.</font>

635
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:23,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does that mean, "I got your back"?</font>

636
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I'd rather they covered the front.</font>

637
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:26,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's where all the good stuff is, isn't it?</font>

638
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:28,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta move.</font>

639
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:35,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. All right. It's okay.</font>

640
01:04:35,956 --> 01:04:38,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy's... Daddy's coming.</font>

641
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:41,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta say, sweetheart,
you really got timing.</font>

642
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:06,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go away! Go away!
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!</font>

643
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. It's just lava.</font>

644
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:25,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deadly boiling lava!</font>

645
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:44,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Boys, are you ready for adventure?
- Yes, sir!</font>

646
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- For danger?
- Yes, sir!</font>

647
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:47,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For death?</font>

648
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:49,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you repeat the question?</font>

649
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jump!</font>

650
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:04,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right! Come on!</font>

651
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever flown one of these before?</font>

652
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:10,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! First time, actually.</font>

653
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:21,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There she is!
- Ellie!</font>

654
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:22,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny!</font>

655
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:28,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to get to her!</font>

656
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen. I'll protect Ellie.</font>

657
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You stop those guys.
- But...</font>

658
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:36,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny, if they reach her, it'll be too late.
You have to trust me.</font>

659
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Let's do it.</font>

660
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:21,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My paws are burning, baby!
They're burning!</font>

661
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got to tip-toe.
Tippy-toe. Tippy-toe.</font>

662
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, twinkle toes!
Giving birth here.</font>

663
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:30,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Sorry. You okay?</font>

664
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:33,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I okay?
Do you know anything about childbirth?</font>

665
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not really, but Manny's coming.</font>

666
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:46,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diego, I'm scared. Can I hold your paw?</font>

667
01:07:46,855 --> 01:07:48,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, of course.</font>

668
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just go with the pain.</font>

669
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:54,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's just a contraction.
- No!</font>

670
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:09,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look! He's right there!</font>

671
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:11,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Roger!
- No! Sid!</font>

672
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know! Roger!</font>

673
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:15,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about we get Sid first
and then go back for Roger?</font>

674
01:08:16,468 --> 01:08:17,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind!</font>

675
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buck?</font>

676
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:50,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, Buck! Buck, wait! Sid's that way!</font>

677
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell that to them!</font>

678
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring it on, you chicken-headed freaks!</font>

679
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:17,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry about a thing.
You're doing fine.</font>

680
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:20,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's going great.</font>

681
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:22,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

682
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just keep breathing!</font>

683
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diego!</font>

684
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:32,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just breathe! That's the important thing.</font>

685
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab that ammo!</font>

686
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bogey, 3 o'clock! Fire!</font>

687
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:59,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is awesome!</font>

688
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Light it up!</font>

689
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah!
- Hasta la vista, birdy!</font>

690
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:21,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get our sloth!</font>

691
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:25,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're hit! We're hit! Mayday! Mayday!</font>

692
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:28,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're losing altitude! Hold these!</font>

693
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tastes like fish.</font>

694
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:35,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. That's just weird.</font>

695
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:40,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I love you, bro!
- I know!</font>

696
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:43,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snap out of it! Come on!</font>

697
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull!</font>

698
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the end of Sid the Sloth!</font>

699
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Help!
- No, Sid! It's me!</font>

700
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And me!
- And me!</font>

701
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:12,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to panic anybody,
but who's flying this thing?</font>

702
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:13,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oops!</font>

703
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, wait! Wait! My kids!</font>

704
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:34,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never even got to say good-bye.</font>

705
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:40,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can do it! Push! Push!</font>

706
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do it!</font>

707
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:44,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just one more big push!</font>

708
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:47,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no idea what I'm going through!</font>

709
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, forget I said that.
Let's do this together.</font>

710
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:03,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I liked you guys better
when you were extinct.</font>

711
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Getting dizzy.</font>

712
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:15,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Manny! Come on, buddy.
I think we're getting close.</font>

713
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:52,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's perfect.</font>

714
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:56,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we should call her Ellie.</font>

715
01:12:58,458 --> 01:12:59,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little Ellie.</font>

716
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:02,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a better name. Peaches.</font>

717
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peaches?</font>

718
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:09,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not? She's sweet and round
and covered with fuzz.</font>

719
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:11,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peaches.</font>

720
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:13,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love it.</font>

721
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:18,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw that, tough guy.</font>

722
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:22,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. That last dino
caught my eye with a claw, and...</font>

723
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:24,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, so I'm not made of stone.</font>

724
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incoming!</font>

725
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:29,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Sid!</font>

726
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's a boy!
- That's its tail.</font>

727
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a girl!</font>

728
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:43,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, sweetheart. Hello, hello!
It's Uncle Sid. Yes, it is.</font>

729
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:48,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're so beautiful. She is!
She looks just like her mother.</font>

730
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank goodness.</font>

731
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No offense, Manny! No offense.
You're beautiful on the inside!</font>

732
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good to have you back, Sid.</font>

733
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:59,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never thought I would say this,
but I missed you, buddy.</font>

734
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:06,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I wish my kids were here.</font>

735
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:09,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could have been friends.</font>

736
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:11,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie!</font>

737
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:17,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promised myself I wouldn't cry.</font>

738
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't.</font>

739
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:27,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I forgot what it was like
to be part of a family.</font>

740
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:30,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about you?
Ever thought about having kids?</font>

741
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:36,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, mammals, let's get you home.</font>

742
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it, mammals.
Right where you started.</font>

743
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:10,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was fun!
We could make it a regular thing.</font>

744
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know about that.</font>

745
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:17,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right! Right. Yes, because of
all the mortal peril, of course.</font>

746
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the Buck stops here.</font>

747
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:24,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We couldn't have done it without you.</font>

748
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:27,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, obviously. But good times, just the...</font>

749
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:31,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not alone, are we?</font>

750
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:36,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Rudy.</font>

751
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:47,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>

752
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:56,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over here, you colossal fossil!</font>

753
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looking for something?</font>

754
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:02,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you come and get it!</font>

755
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To the cave! Go!</font>

756
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:10,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stay with the baby.
- We'll be fine. Go.</font>

757
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:19,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wuss.</font>

758
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pop goes the weasel!</font>

759
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Move!</font>

760
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:53,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Diego! Catch!
- Got it!</font>

761
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:06,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Through the hole, over the valley.
One more loop...</font>

762
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, lads! Heave!</font>

763
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better luck next time, snowflake.</font>

764
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't going to hold him long! Let's go!</font>

765
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold up, guys!</font>

766
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Way to go, Momzilla!</font>

767
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:28,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here, kids.
Well, let me tell you something.</font>

768
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're where you belong now.</font>

769
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:35,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm sure you're going to grow up
to be giant, horrifying dinosaurs</font>

770
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just like your mother.</font>

771
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:41,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Momma,</font>

772
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:45,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">take good care of our kids.</font>

773
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:16,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You were a good parent, Sid.
- Thanks.</font>

774
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:19,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I baby-sit for you?
- Not a chance.</font>

775
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:22,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on. I work cheap!
- All right, I'll think about it.</font>

776
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:25,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

777
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never happen.</font>

778
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:33,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gone. What am I supposed to do now?</font>

779
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:36,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's easy. Come with us.</font>

780
01:20:38,209 --> 01:20:40,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean up there?</font>

781
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:44,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never thought of going back.</font>

782
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:47,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been down here so long,
it feels like up to me.</font>

783
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure I can fit in up there anymore.</font>

784
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:53,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So? Look at us.
We look like a normal herd to you?</font>

785
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:24,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So long, big guy.</font>

786
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:39,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's our cue! Come on, Peaches.</font>

787
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:42,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's alive!</font>

788
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:45,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buck?</font>

789
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:48,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I got to...</font>

790
01:21:49,363 --> 01:21:50,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

791
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:54,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, this world should
really stay down here.</font>

792
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:58,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take care of them, Tiger.</font>

793
01:21:58,289 --> 01:22:00,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Always listen to Buck."</font>

794
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:03,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're almost out!</font>

795
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rudy!</font>

796
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:34,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is everybody okay?</font>

797
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:36,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Buck?</font>

798
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:42,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. He's where he wants to be.</font>

799
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:46,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is he gonna be okay?
- Are you kidding?</font>

800
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:50,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing could kill that weasel.
It's Rudy I'm worried about.</font>

801
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:05,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know this "baby makes 3" thing
isn't for you,</font>

802
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:08,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but whatever you decide to do...</font>

803
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:10,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not leaving, buddy.</font>

804
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:13,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life of adventure? It's right here.</font>

805
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:16,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I got a whole speech here.
I've been working on it.</font>

806
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:20,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I show you
that I'm strong and sensitive?</font>

807
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:22,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Noble yet caring?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

809
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:42,725

01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:44,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I mean, look at my kids.</font>

811
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:47,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seems like they were born one day
and then gone the next.</font>

812
01:23:47,398 --> 01:23:48,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were, Sid.</font>

813
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. That was a lot of work.</font>

814
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:06,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right, sweetheart.
