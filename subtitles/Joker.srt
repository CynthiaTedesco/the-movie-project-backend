about that.</font>

181
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:41,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lived with my mother before I made it.
Just me and her.</font>

came back.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aww.</font>

for as long as I can remember.</font>

187
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,432

of my mother.</font>

188
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.</font>

189
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She does.</font>

190
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:06,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.</font>

191
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She says I was put here to
spread joy and laughter.</font>

192
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aww.</font>

193
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

194
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like that. I like that a lot.
Come on down.</font>

195
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.
For that, you gotta come down.</font>

196
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Come on.</font>

197
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:33,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

198
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:50,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we got a big show tonight.
Stay tuned.</font>

199
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll be right back.</font>

200
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:54,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.</font>

201
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.</font>

202
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It made my day.</font>

203
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:59,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Murray.</font>

204
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see all this,
the lights, the show,</font>

205
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the audience,
all that stuff?</font>

206
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat</font>

207
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to have a kid
like you.</font>

208
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?</font>

209
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another day
in chuckle town.</font>

210
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yup.</font>

211
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

212
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard about
the beatdown you took.</font>

213
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking savages.</font>

214
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:07,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.</font>

215
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

216
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll take everything
from you if you do that.</font>

217
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the crazy shit
out there.</font>

218
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're animals.</font>

219
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?</font>

220
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:27,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

221
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

222
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it.</font>

223
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's for you.</font>

224
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta
protect yourself out there.</font>

225
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise,
you're gonna get fucked.</font>

226
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Randall,</font>

227
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:49,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not supposed to
have a gun.</font>

228
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't sweat it, Art.</font>

229
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one
has to know.</font>

230
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you can pay me
back some other time.</font>

231
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know
you're my boy.</font>

232
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:01,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arthur,</font>

233
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.</font>

234
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Gary.
You know what I've always wondered?</font>

235
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No idea.</font>

236
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:10,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you people call it
miniature golf</font>

237
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or is it just golf
to you?</font>

238
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Punch him in the
dick, Gary.</font>

239
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Hoyt.</font>

240
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gary said you wanted to see me.</font>

241
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?</font>

242
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not quite.</font>

243
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just been working
on my material.</font>

244
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.</font>

245
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look,
I like you, Arthur.</font>

246
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
a lot of the guys,</font>

247
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:52,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they think you're a freak,
but I like you.</font>

248
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:56,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even know
why I like you.</font>

249
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I got
another complaint.</font>

250
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.</font>

251
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The guy said
you disappeared.</font>

252
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never even
returned his sign.</font>

253
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I got jumped.</font>

254
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't you hear?</font>

255
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For a sign?</font>

256
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.</font>

257
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:16,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get him
his sign back.</font>

258
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:18,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going out of business,
for God's sake, Arthur.</font>

259
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would
I keep his sign?</font>

260
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?</font>

261
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't
return the sign,</font>

262
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.</font>

263
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we clear?</font>

264
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen,
I'm trying to help you.</font>

265
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.</font>

266
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other guys,</font>

267
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,</font>

268
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because people
think you're weird.</font>

269
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,224

Are you okay?</font>

306
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, what?</font>

307
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That noise!
Did you hear that noise?</font>

403
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

404
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talking to you.
Hey.</font>

405
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, thank you.</font>

406
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure?</font>

407
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're real good.</font>

408
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't ignore him.
He's being nice to you.</font>

409
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo...</font>

410
00:30:49,716 --> 00:30:51,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is something funny,
asshole?</font>

411
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:57,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bitch!</font>

412
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:07,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Isn't it rich?</i></font>

414
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:15,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Me here at last
on the ground</i></font>

415
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And you
in mid-air</i></font>

416
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Send in the clowns</i></font>

417
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Isn't it bliss?</i></font>

418
00:31:28,821 --> 00:31:31,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Don't you approve?</i></font>

419
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:34,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>One who keeps
tearing around</i></font>

420
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:37,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And one who
can't move</i></font>

421
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:40,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Where are the clowns?</i></font>

422
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:44,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There ought
to be clowns</i></font>

423
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, buddy, tell us,
what's so fucking funny?</font>

424
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

425
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have...
I have a condition.</font>

426
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:06,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you what you
have, you asshole.</font>

427
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:08,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

428
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, stop!</font>

429
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got
a kicker, huh?</font>

430
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:16,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hold him steady.
Hold him steady.</font>

431
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay down, freak!</font>

432
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:41,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. Shit.</font>

438
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:50,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I read it was
a guy in full makeup.</font>

439
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:53,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No,
it says right here it was a mask.</font>

440
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:55,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Either way,
I think it's good for business.</font>

00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, mate.</font>

446
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

447
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't seem fair,</font>

448
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:12,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">getting fired like that.</font>

449
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:14,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you really
bring a gun</font>

450
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the children's
hospital, Artie?</font>

451
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck would
you do that for?</font>

452
00:37:18,871 --> 00:37:20,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that part of
your new act, Arthur?</font>

453
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If your dancing
doesn't do the trick,</font>

454
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're just gonna
shoot yourself?</font>

455
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:25,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you ask
Randall about it?</font>

456
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:27,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was his gun.</font>

457
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:29,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- I still owe you for that,</font>

458

459
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:33,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck
are you talking about?</font>

460
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop talking
out of your ass, Art.</font>

461
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no!</font>

462
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I forgot
to punch out.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>this is a difficult time

473
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why him?</font>

474
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:38,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like

I told you, we're family.</font>

it makes total sense to me.</i></font>

492

503
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:10,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard this song on

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arthur...</font>

506
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:20,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is crazy,</font>

507
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:26,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because that's
my clown name at work.</font>

508
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:29,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And until
a little while ago,</font>

509
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:33,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it was like
nobody ever saw me.</font>

513
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:51,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think you
ever really hear me.</font>

514
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:54,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just ask the same
questions every week.</font>

515
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:58,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"How's your job?
Are you having any negative thoughts?"</font>

516
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:02,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I have are
negative thoughts,</font>

517
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:05,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you don't
listen anyway.</font>

518
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:09,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said,
for my whole life,</font>

519
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:12,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know
if I even really existed.</font>

520
00:41:14,106 --> 00:41:15,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do.</font>

521
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:21,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And people are
starting to notice.</font>

522
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've cut our funding.</font>

523
00:41:24,717 --> 00:41:26,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're closing down
our offices next week.</font>

524
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The city has cut funding
across the board.</font>

525
00:41:30,022 --> 00:41:32,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Social Services is
part of that.</font>

526
00:41:32,124 --> 00:41:34,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the last time
we'll be meeting.</font>

527
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:36,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

528
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:42,835

people like you, Arthur.</font>

529
00:41:44,837 --> 00:41:46,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they really
don't give a shit</font>

530

531
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

532
00:42:01,053 --> 00:42:03,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How am I supposed to
get my medication now?</font>

533
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who do I talk to?</font>

534
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:12,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Arthur.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, sir.</font>

672
00:55:54,653 --> 00:55:55,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does your mother take
any medications?</font>

673
00:55:55,754 --> 00:55:56,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Excuse me,</font>

674
00:55:56,889 --> 00:55:58,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I couldn't hear you.
- No.</font>

675
00:55:58,624 --> 00:55:59,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, when was the last
time you spoke to her?</font>

676
00:55:59,925 --> 00:56:01,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

677
00:56:46,005 --> 00:56:48,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Fleck.</font>

678
00:56:48,274 --> 00:56:50,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry to bother you.
I'm Detective Garrity.</font>

679
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:53,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my partner,
Detective Burke.</font>

680
00:56:53,078 --> 00:56:56,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had a few questions for
you, but you weren't home,</font>

681
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:59,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so we spoke
with your mother.</font>

682
00:57:00,819 --> 00:57:01,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

683
00:57:02,755 --> 00:57:04,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you
say to her?</font>

684
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:05,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you do this?</font>

685
00:57:05,557 --> 00:57:07,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No.</font>

686
00:57:07,126 --> 00:57:09,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.
We just asked her some questions,</font>

687
00:57:09,395 --> 00:57:11,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she got hysterical.</font>

688
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hyperventilating,</font>

689
00:57:12,865 --> 00:57:14,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">collapsed and hit
her head pretty hard.</font>

690
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. The doctor said
she had a stroke.</font>

691
00:57:16,902 --> 00:57:19,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're sorry to
hear about that.</font>

692
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:22,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, like I said,
I still have some questions for you.</font>

693
00:57:22,675 --> 00:57:23,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're about
the subway killings</font>

694
00:57:23,943 --> 00:57:25,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that happened
last week.</font>

695
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:26,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've heard about them, right?</font>

696
00:57:26,879 --> 00:57:28,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

697
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's horrible.</font>

698
00:57:29,214 --> 00:57:31,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

699
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:34,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we spoke with your
boss over at Haha's.</font>

700
00:57:34,586 --> 00:57:36,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said you were fired
for bringing a gun</font>

701
00:57:36,689 --> 00:57:38,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into the children's hospital.</font>

702
00:57:39,692 --> 00:57:41,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.</font>

703
00:57:41,794 --> 00:57:43,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's part
of my act.</font>

704
00:57:43,762 --> 00:57:45,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a party clown.</font>

705
00:57:45,164 --> 00:57:47,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
So, why were you fired?</font>

706
00:57:50,536 --> 00:57:53,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They said
I wasn't funny enough.</font>

707
00:57:53,305 --> 00:57:55,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you imagine that?</font>

708
00:57:55,207 --> 00:57:59,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't mind,
I have to go take care of my mother.</font>

709
00:57:59,211 --> 00:58:01,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your boss also
gave us one of your cards.</font>

710
00:58:03,782 --> 00:58:06,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This condition of yours,
the laughing,</font>

711
00:58:07,052 --> 00:58:08,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is it real,</font>

712
00:58:08,454 --> 00:58:10,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or some sort
of clown thing?</font>

713
00:58:10,756 --> 00:58:13,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A clown thing?
- Yeah.</font>

714
00:58:13,692 --> 00:58:16,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, is it part of your act?</font>

715
00:58:18,597 --> 00:58:20,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think?</font>

716
00:58:25,804 --> 00:58:27,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's exit only.</font>

717
00:58:51,463 --> 00:58:53,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's gonna be okay.</font>

718
00:58:57,836 --> 00:58:59,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna
get a coffee.</font>

719
00:59:00,372 --> 00:59:01,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want one?</font>

720
00:59:01,508 --> 00:59:02,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

721
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:18,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So, the other night,
I told my youngest son Billy,</i></font>

722
00:59:18,724 --> 00:59:21,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>you know, the new one,

723
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I told him,
"The garbage strike</i></font>

724
00:59:23,629 --> 00:59:25,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>is still going on, Billy."</i></font>

725
00:59:25,397 --> 00:59:27,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And he says, and I'm not
kidding, Billy says,</i></font>

726
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:29,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"So, where are we gonna
get all our garbage from?"</i></font>

727
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:39,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And finally,

728
00:59:39,078 --> 00:59:40,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>thinks they could
do my job,</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>we got this video tape

735

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I hated school as a kid.</i></font>

736
01:00:00,766 --> 01:00:03,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But my mother

I love this guy.</i></font>

744
01:00:27,527 --> 01:00:29,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It's funny,</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>when I was
a little boy</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at us.</font>

803
01:05:59,157 --> 01:06:00,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you are.</font>

804
01:06:00,693 --> 01:06:02,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's impossible</font>

805
01:06:02,327 --> 01:06:03,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because you're adopted,</font>

806
01:06:03,596 --> 01:06:05,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I never slept with
your mother.</font>

807
01:06:05,363 --> 01:06:06,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I wasn't adopted.
- What do you want from me?</font>

808
01:06:06,498 --> 01:06:07,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Money?
- No, I don't...</font>

809
01:06:08,066 --> 01:06:09,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't adopted.</font>

810
01:06:09,301 --> 01:06:11,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus.
She never told you?</font>

811
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:13,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Told me what?</font>

812
01:06:14,841 --> 01:06:16,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mother adopted you
while she was working for us.</font>

813
01:06:16,475 --> 01:06:18,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not true.</font>

814
01:06:18,076 --> 01:06:19,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you
saying that?</font>

815
01:06:19,377 --> 01:06:20,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then she was arrested
and committed</font>

816
01:06:20,312 --> 01:06:21,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to Arkham State Hospital,</font>

817
01:06:21,547 --> 01:06:23,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you were
just a little boy.</font>

818
01:06:23,181 --> 01:06:24,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you
saying this?</font>

819
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:26,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need you to
tell me lies.</font>

820
01:06:26,151 --> 01:06:27,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know
it seems strange.</font>

821
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't mean to
make you uncomfortable.</font>

822
01:06:29,321 --> 01:06:31,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know why
everyone is so rude.</font>

823
01:06:31,122 --> 01:06:32,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know
why you are.</font>

824
01:06:32,424 --> 01:06:33,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want
anything from you.</font>

825
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe a little bit of
warmth, maybe a hug, Dad!</font>

826
01:06:36,461 --> 01:06:38,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about just a little
bit of fucking decency?</font>

827
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:40,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it
with you people?</font>

828
01:06:40,232 --> 01:06:42,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You say that stuff
about my mother.</font>

829
01:06:42,535 --> 01:06:43,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's crazy.</font>

830
01:06:43,903 --> 01:06:46,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's...</font>

831
01:06:53,445 --> 01:06:55,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think
this is funny?</font>

832
01:06:56,448 --> 01:06:59,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, it's me.
Come on.</font>

833
01:07:02,454 --> 01:07:03,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Touch
my son again,</font>

834
01:07:03,756 --> 01:07:05,257

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. I hear you, brother.
- Hmm.</font>

881

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes,
I don't know what to do.</font>

882
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:15,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last time, I ended up taking
it out on some people.</font>

me, but it really hasn't.</font>

885
01:11:22,882 --> 01:11:26,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fucked up and
did some bad shit.</font>

what I'm talking about,</font>

887
01:11:31,991 --> 01:11:36,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's so hard to just try

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, listen, man.</font>

889
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just
an administrative assistant.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a clerk,
you know.</font>

891
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:46,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I do
is file paperwork.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know
what to tell you.</font>

893
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you should
see somebody.</font>

894
01:11:51,409 --> 01:11:52,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
they got programs,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">city services,
stuff like that.</font>

896
01:11:55,446 --> 01:11:56,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>

897
01:11:56,882 --> 01:11:58,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They cut all those.</font>

898

<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, here it is. Fleck.</font>

01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:41,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

908
01:12:48,133 --> 01:12:50,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, man. Like I said,
I can't release these records,</font>

get in trouble.</font>

your mom in here to sign,</font>

912
01:12:58,143 --> 01:12:59,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that'll be much easier,</font>

913
01:12:59,845 --> 01:13:02,380

<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time
for bed.</font>

935
01:17:26,712 --> 01:17:28,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

936
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing in here?</font>

937
01:17:32,851 --> 01:17:34,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're in the
wrong apartment.</font>

938
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:43,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your name's Arthur, right?</font>

939
01:17:43,729 --> 01:17:45,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You live
down the hall.</font>

940
01:17:48,066 --> 01:17:50,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really
need you to leave.</font>

941
01:17:54,139 --> 01:17:57,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My little girl is sleeping
in the other room.</font>

942
01:18:02,414 --> 01:18:03,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

943
01:18:06,218 --> 01:18:08,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a bad day.</font>

944
01:18:11,089 --> 01:18:13,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I call someone?
Is your mother home?</font>

945
01:19:39,911 --> 01:19:41,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up!</font>

946
01:20:00,832 --> 01:20:02,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Penny.</font>

947

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Penny Fleck.</font>

948
01:20:14,146 --> 01:20:16,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always hated
that name.</font>

949
01:20:19,519 --> 01:20:21,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know how you used to tell me</font>

950
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:26,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that my laugh
was a condition?</font>

951
01:20:27,627 --> 01:20:30,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That there was
something wrong with me?</font>

952
01:20:32,964 --> 01:20:34,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There isn't.</font>

953
01:20:37,035 --> 01:20:39,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the real me.</font>

954
01:20:39,171 --> 01:20:40,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy.</font>

955
01:20:42,941 --> 01:20:45,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy. Hmm.</font>

956
01:20:48,781 --> 01:20:51,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't been happy</font>

957
01:20:51,483 --> 01:20:54,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one minute of
my entire fucking life.</font>

958

what's funny?</font>

959
01:21:04,996 --> 01:21:07,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what really
makes me laugh?</font>

960
01:21:09,134 --> 01:21:11,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to think that my
life was a tragedy...</font>

961

<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but now I realize</font>

992
01:26:26,886 --> 01:26:28,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you get
a new gig?</font>

993

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's with the makeup then?</font>

999
01:26:42,802 --> 01:26:44,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom died.</font>

1000

1001
01:26:46,438 --> 01:26:47,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. We heard.</font>

1002
01:26:47,573 --> 01:26:49,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why
we came by.</font>

1003
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:52,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We figured, you know,
you could use some cheering up.</font>

1004
01:26:52,144 --> 01:26:53,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, that's sweet.</font>

1005
01:26:53,979 --> 01:26:57,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, no, I feel good.</font>

1006
01:26:57,516 --> 01:26:59,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I stopped
taking my medication.</font>

1007
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:01,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel
a lot better now.</font>

1008
01:27:03,155 --> 01:27:05,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, okay.
Good for you.</font>

1009
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:10,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, hey, listen,
I don't know if you heard,</font>

1010
01:27:10,696 --> 01:27:13,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the cops have been
coming around the shop,</font>

1011
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:17,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">talking to all the guys
about those subway murders.</font>

1012
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:19,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And, um...
- They didn't talk to me.</font>

1013
01:27:21,674 --> 01:27:24,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's because the suspect
was a regular-sized person.</font>

1014
01:27:24,844 --> 01:27:27,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it was a fucking midget,
you'd be in jail right now.</font>

1015
01:27:33,284 --> 01:27:34,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, um,</font>

1016
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:38,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hoyt said that
they talked to you,</font>

1017
01:27:38,758 --> 01:27:40,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now
they're looking for me,</font>

1018
01:27:40,258 --> 01:27:41,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I just wanna know
what you said.</font>

1019
01:27:41,861 --> 01:27:43,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure
our stories line up.</font>

1020
01:27:43,729 --> 01:27:46,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Seeing as how you're my boy.
- Yeah, that's important.</font>

1021
01:27:46,699 --> 01:27:48,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That makes a lot of sense.
- You know what I mean?</font>

1022
01:27:48,567 --> 01:27:50,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.</font>

1023
01:27:56,142 --> 01:27:57,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arthur!</font>

1024

<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1025
01:28:00,411 --> 01:28:01,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1026
01:28:02,882 --> 01:28:03,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1027
01:28:11,624 --> 01:28:13,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would
you do that, Arthur?</font>

1028
01:28:34,747 --> 01:28:37,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you watch
The Murray Franklin Show?</font>

1029
01:28:37,149 --> 01:28:38,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1030

1034
01:28:54,967 --> 01:28:56,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1035
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, Gary.</font>

1036
01:29:02,575 --> 01:29:03,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can go.</font>

1037

hurt you.</font>

1038
01:29:10,916 --> 01:29:12,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1039
01:29:12,483 --> 01:29:14,753

That's all bullshit.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Murray.</font>

1097

are you part of the protest?</font>

He's aware of that. Yeah.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll go on
right after Dr. Sally.</font>

1122

Someone will</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- come and get you, okay?
- Okay. Perfect.</font>

1125
01:36:15,742 --> 01:36:16,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck.</font>

1126
01:36:16,908 --> 01:36:18,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks, Murray.
- Okay.</font>

1127
01:36:19,077 --> 01:36:22,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Murray, one small thing.
- Yeah.</font>

1128
01:36:22,582 --> 01:36:24,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you
bring me out,</font>

1129
01:36:24,249 --> 01:36:26,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can you
introduce me as Joker?</font>

1130
01:36:26,285 --> 01:36:28,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong
with your real name?</font>

1131
01:36:28,554 --> 01:36:31,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what you
called me on the show.</font>

1132
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:32,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A joker.</font>

1133
01:36:32,525 --> 01:36:33,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you remember?</font>

1134
01:36:33,825 --> 01:36:35,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did I?
- I don't know.</font>

1135
01:36:35,762 --> 01:36:38,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, Joker it is.</font>

1136
01:36:38,363 --> 01:36:39,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good.</font>

1137
01:36:39,498 --> 01:36:40,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Murray.</font>

1138
01:37:02,421 --> 01:37:04,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll try it,
you know,</font>

1139
01:37:04,089 --> 01:37:05,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm not sure my
wife will let me do it.</font>

1140
01:37:07,159 --> 01:37:08,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe my next wife.</font>

1141
01:37:12,197 --> 01:37:14,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta see our next
guest for yourself.</font>

1142
01:37:14,132 --> 01:37:16,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm pretty sure this
guy could use a doctor.</font>

1143
01:37:16,435 --> 01:37:17,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1144
01:37:17,737 --> 01:37:19,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does he have
sexual problems?</font>

1145
01:37:19,404 --> 01:37:21,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, he looks like
he's got a lot of problems.</font>

1146
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:25,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Bobby,
let's show that clip one last time.</font>

1147
01:37:31,684 --> 01:37:34,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I hated
school as a kid.</i></font>

1148
01:37:36,421 --> 01:37:39,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But my mother
would always say,</i></font>

1149
01:37:39,592 --> 01:37:41,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"You should enjoy it.</i></font>

1150
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:44,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>One day,
you'll have to work for a living."</i></font>

1151
01:37:44,329 --> 01:37:45,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"No, I won't, Ma.</i></font>

1152
01:37:45,531 --> 01:37:47,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm gonna be
a comedian."</i></font>

1153
01:37:53,706 --> 01:37:57,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. You may...</font>

1154
01:37:57,510 --> 01:38:00,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may have seen that
clip of our next guest.</font>

1155
01:38:00,847 --> 01:38:03,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, before he comes
out, I just want to say</font>

1156
01:38:03,683 --> 01:38:05,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we're
all heartbroken</font>

1157
01:38:05,150 --> 01:38:07,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about what's going on
in the city tonight.</font>

1158
01:38:07,252 --> 01:38:09,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this is how he
wanted to come out,</font>

1159
01:38:09,622 --> 01:38:13,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and honestly,
I think we could all use a good laugh.</font>

1160
01:38:13,125 --> 01:38:16,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, please welcome, Joker.</font>

1161
01:38:57,969 --> 01:38:59,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you
all right, Doctor?</font>

1162
01:39:03,141 --> 01:39:05,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well,
that was quite an entrance.</font>

1163
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:13,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

1164
01:39:16,021 --> 01:39:17,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1165
01:39:17,489 --> 01:39:20,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is exactly
how I imagined it.</font>

1166
01:39:22,227 --> 01:39:24,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that makes
one of us.</font>

1167
01:39:30,969 --> 01:39:33,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, can you tell us
about this look?</font>

1168
01:39:33,238 --> 01:39:34,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we spoke earlier,</font>

1169
01:39:34,941 --> 01:39:36,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement.</font>

1170
01:39:36,876 --> 01:39:38,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that right?</font>

1171
01:39:38,176 --> 01:39:39,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.</font>

1172
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:42,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just trying to
make people laugh.</font>

1173
01:39:42,447 --> 01:39:44,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how's that going for you?</font>

1174
01:39:52,525 --> 01:39:54,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I know
you're a comedian.</font>

1175
01:39:54,527 --> 01:39:56,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You been working on
any new material?</font>

1176
01:39:56,461 --> 01:39:57,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna
tell us a joke?</font>

1177
01:40:03,536 --> 01:40:04,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>

1178
01:40:06,672 --> 01:40:07,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1179
01:40:13,713 --> 01:40:15,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got a book.</font>

1180
01:40:16,147 --> 01:40:17,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A book of jokes.</font>

1181
01:40:27,392 --> 01:40:29,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take your time.
We got all night.</font>

1182
01:40:34,934 --> 01:40:37,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay.
Here's one.</font>

1183
01:40:40,272 --> 01:40:42,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knock, knock.</font>

1184
01:40:43,009 --> 01:40:44,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you had to
look that up?</font>

1185
01:40:51,383 --> 01:40:53,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to
get it right.</font>

1186
01:40:54,954 --> 01:40:56,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knock, knock.</font>

1187
01:40:56,722 --> 01:40:58,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's there?</font>

1188
01:40:59,491 --> 01:41:01,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the police, ma'am.</font>

1189
01:41:01,159 --> 01:41:03,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.</font>

1190
01:41:03,161 --> 01:41:06,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's dead.</font>

1191
01:41:07,432 --> 01:41:09,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, no.</font>

1192
01:41:09,234 --> 01:41:11,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you cannot
joke about that.</font>

1193
01:41:11,169 --> 01:41:13,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's
not funny, Arthur.</font>

1194
01:41:13,071 --> 01:41:16,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not that kind of
humor we do on this show.</font>

1195
01:41:16,308 --> 01:41:18,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I'm...
Yeah, I'm sorry.</font>

1196
01:41:18,678 --> 01:41:23,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just, you know,
it's been a rough few weeks, Murray.</font>

1197
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:26,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever since</font>

1198
01:41:28,955 --> 01:41:31,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I killed those three
Wall Street guys.</font>

1199
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:40,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'm waiting
for the punch line.</font>

1200
01:41:41,299 --> 01:41:43,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is
no punch line.</font>

1201
01:41:44,402 --> 01:41:46,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a joke.</font>

1202
01:41:51,043 --> 01:41:52,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're serious,
aren't you?</font>

1203

you killed</font>

1204
01:41:53,546 --> 01:41:54,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">those three young men
on the subway?</font>

1205
01:41:54,747 --> 01:41:55,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-hmm.</font>

1206
01:41:55,748 --> 01:41:57,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And why should
we believe you?</font>

1207
01:41:57,583 --> 01:41:59,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got nothing
left to lose.</font>

1208
01:42:01,554 --> 01:42:03,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing can
hurt me anymore.</font>

1209
01:42:06,726 --> 01:42:10,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My life is
nothing but a comedy.</font>

1210
01:42:13,331 --> 01:42:14,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, let me
get this straight,</font>

1211
01:42:14,734 --> 01:42:16,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you think that killing
those guys is funny?</font>

1212
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:18,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do.</font>

1213
01:42:18,904 --> 01:42:21,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm tired of
pretending it's not.</font>

1214
01:42:21,741 --> 01:42:24,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Comedy is subjective,
Murray.</font>

1215
01:42:24,209 --> 01:42:26,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't that
what they say?</font>

1216
01:42:26,112 --> 01:42:27,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of you,</font>

1217
01:42:28,047 --> 01:42:30,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the system
that knows so much,</font>

what's right or wrong.</font>

1219
01:42:33,552 --> 01:42:38,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The same way that you
decide what's funny or not!</font>

1220
01:42:40,191 --> 01:42:41,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him off!</font>

1221
01:42:41,794 --> 01:42:45,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, okay,
I think I might understand</font>

1222
01:42:45,831 --> 01:42:47,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you did this to
start a movement,</font>

1223
01:42:47,465 --> 01:42:50,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to become a symbol?</font>

1224
01:42:50,168 --> 01:42:51,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Murray.</font>

1225
01:42:51,737 --> 01:42:53,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I look like
the kind of clown</font>

1226
01:42:53,139 --> 01:42:54,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that could
start a movement?</font>

1227
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:57,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I killed those guys
because they were awful.</font>

1228
01:42:57,743 --> 01:43:00,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody is awful
these days.</font>

1229
01:43:00,478 --> 01:43:02,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's enough to
make anyone crazy.</font>

1230
01:43:02,848 --> 01:43:04,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.
So, that's it, you're crazy.</font>

1231
01:43:04,784 --> 01:43:07,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's your defense for
killing three young men?</font>

1232
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1233
01:43:09,522 --> 01:43:13,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They couldn't carry a
tune to save their lives.</font>

1234
01:43:14,727 --> 01:43:18,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, why is everybody so
upset about these guys?</font>

1235
01:43:18,898 --> 01:43:20,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,</font>

1236
01:43:20,733 --> 01:43:22,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'd walk
right over me!</font>

1237
01:43:22,367 --> 01:43:24,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.</font>

1238
01:43:24,603 --> 01:43:26,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But these guys, what,
because Thomas Wayne</font>

1239
01:43:26,872 --> 01:43:28,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">went and cried about them on TV?</font>

1240
01:43:28,641 --> 01:43:30,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?</font>

1241
01:43:31,010 --> 01:43:32,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I do.</font>

1242
01:43:32,878 --> 01:43:36,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you seen what it's
like out there, Murray?</font>

1243
01:43:36,549 --> 01:43:39,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you ever actually
leave the studio?</font>

1244
01:43:39,719 --> 01:43:43,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody just yells and
screams at each other.</font>

1245
01:43:43,923 --> 01:43:45,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody's civil anymore.</font>

1246
01:43:45,991 --> 01:43:50,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody thinks what it's
like to be the other guy.</font>

1247
01:43:50,495 --> 01:43:53,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think men like
Thomas Wayne ever think</font>

1248
01:43:53,398 --> 01:43:55,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what it's like to be
someone like me?</font>

1249
01:43:55,501 --> 01:43:58,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.</font>

1250
01:43:58,436 --> 01:44:00,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They think that
we'll just sit there</font>

1251
01:44:00,606 --> 01:44:03,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and take it,
like good little boys!</font>

1252
01:44:03,341 --> 01:44:05,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That we won't werewolf
and go wild!</font>

1253
01:44:05,745 --> 01:44:07,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You finished?</font>

1254
01:44:07,179 --> 01:44:09,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.</font>

1255
01:44:09,782 --> 01:44:11,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sound like
you're making excuses</font>

1256
01:44:11,483 --> 01:44:12,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for killing
those young men.</font>

1257
01:44:12,952 --> 01:44:15,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,</font>

1258
01:44:15,087 --> 01:44:16,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not everyone is awful.</font>

1259
01:44:18,657 --> 01:44:20,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're awful, Murray.</font>

1260
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:22,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me? I'm awful?</font>

1261
01:44:22,194 --> 01:44:23,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah,
how am I awful?</font>
