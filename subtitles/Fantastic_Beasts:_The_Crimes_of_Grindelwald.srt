1
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be glad to be
rid of him, I expect.</font>

2
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:40,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'd be more than happy
to keep him here in custody.</font>

3
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:42,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 months are enough.</font>

4
00:01:42,717 --> 00:01:45,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time for him to answer
for his crimes in Europe.</font>

5
00:01:45,987 --> 00:01:47,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">President Picquery.</font>

6
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:48,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Spielman, sir.</font>

7
00:01:48,955 --> 00:01:52,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prisoner is secured
and ready to travel.</font>

8
00:01:57,732 --> 00:01:59,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've thrown
everything at him, I see.</font>

9
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:03,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was necessary.
He's extremely powerful.</font>

10
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:06,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've had to change
his guard 3 times.</font>

11
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's very persuasive.</font>

12
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we removed his tongue.</font>

13
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grindelwald!
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!</font>

14
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:27,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grindelwald! Grindelwald!</font>

15
00:02:37,104 --> 00:02:39,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The wizarding
community worldwide</font>

16
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:41,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">owes you a great debt,
Madam President.</font>

17
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not underestimate him.</font>

18
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:50,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Spielman,
we found his wand hidden away.</font>

19
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abernathy.</font>

20
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:58,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we found this.</font>

21
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:12,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiyah!</font>

22
00:03:49,777 --> 00:03:52,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more silver tongue. Hmm?</font>

23
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have joined
a noble cause, my friend.</font>

24
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:23,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. I know.
I know, Antonio.</font>

25
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:30,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So needy.</font>

26
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're ready for you, Newt.</font>

27
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:45,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leta.</font>

28
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:49,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

29
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:50,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Theseus thought
it would be good</font>

30
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if I became part of
the Ministry family.</font>

31
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:56,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he actually say the words
"Ministry family"?</font>

32
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:58,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That sounds like my brother.</font>

33
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:18,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Theseus was disappointed
you couldn't come to dinner.</font>

34
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:21,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any of the nights
we've asked you.</font>

35
00:09:21,942 --> 00:09:23,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I've been busy.</font>

36
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:24,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's your brother, Newt.</font>

37
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:27,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He likes spending time
with you.</font>

38
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:29,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so do I.</font>

39
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:38,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oi, you! Hop in, Pick.</font>

40
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do strange creatures
love you so much?</font>

41
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:42,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there are
no strange creatures.</font>

42
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:44,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only blinkered people.</font>

43
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:49,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long did you
get in detention</font>

44
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for saying that
to Prendergast?</font>

45
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:53,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it was
a month that time.</font>

46
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:55,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I set off a dungbomb
under his desk</font>

47
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:57,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I could join you.
Do you remember?</font>

48
00:10:02,783 --> 00:10:04,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

49
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:05,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I actually
don't remember that.</font>

50
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:08,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

51
00:10:08,055 --> 00:10:11,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Theseus. We were just talking
about Newt coming for dinner.</font>

52
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:14,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Well...</font>

53
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:16,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, before we go
in there, I...</font>

54
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:17,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my 5th attempt,
Theseus. I know the form.</font>

55
00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:20,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't gonna be like
the other times. This is...</font>

56
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:24,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just try and keep
an open mind. Will you?</font>

57
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:26,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And maybe a little less...</font>

58
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like me.</font>

59
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:30,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it can't hurt.</font>

60
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:32,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's go.</font>

61
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:41,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hearing commences.</i></font>

62
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:45,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want an end to the ban on
you traveling internationally.</font>

63
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:47,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

64
00:10:47,228 --> 00:10:49,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I'd like to
travel internationally.</font>

65
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:52,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Subject uncooperative
and evasive</font>

66
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:54,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on reasons for
last international trip.</font>

67
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:56,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a field trip, sir.</font>

68
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just collecting material
for my book on magical beasts.</font>

69
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:01,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You destroyed
half of New York.</font>

70
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:03,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's actually factually
incorrect on 2 counts.</font>

71
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:04,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Newt.</font>

72
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:09,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Scamander, it's clear
you're frustrated,</font>

73
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:12,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and, frankly, so are we.</font>

74
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:16,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the spirit of compromise,</font>

75
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we'd like to
make a proposition.</font>

76
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:20,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of proposition?</font>

77
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The committee
will agree to lift</font>

78
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:24,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your travel ban
under one condition.</font>

79
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:26,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You join the Ministry.</font>

80
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:29,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Specifically,
your brother's department.</font>

81
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:34,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

82
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:37,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that</font>

83
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:39,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Theseus is the Auror.</font>

84
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:41,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think my talents
lie elsewhere.</font>

85
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:42,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Scamander,</font>

86
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:44,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the wizarding
and non-wizarding worlds</font>

87
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:47,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have been at peace
for over a century.</font>

88
00:11:47,354 --> 00:11:50,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grindelwald wants to see
that peace destroyed.</font>

89
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:53,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And for certain members
of our community,</font>

90
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">his message is very seductive.</font>

91
00:11:56,797 --> 00:12:00,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Many purebloods believe it is
their birthright to rule</font>

92
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:06,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not only our world but
the non-magic world as well.</font>

93
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:08,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They see Grindelwald
as their hero,</font>

94
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Grindelwald sees this</font>

95
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:14,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">boy as a means to
make this all come true.</font>

96
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
You're talking about Credence</font>

97
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:19,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as if he were still here.</font>

98
00:12:20,988 --> 00:12:22,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He survived, Newt.</font>

99
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:26,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's still alive.</font>

100
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:28,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He left New York months ago.</font>

101
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:30,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's somewhere in Europe.</font>

102
00:12:30,197 --> 00:12:31,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where exactly,
we don't know, but...</font>

103
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:34,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me to
hunt Credence down?</font>

104
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:36,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To kill him?</font>

105
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:39,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same old Scamander.</font>

106
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:43,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is he doing here?</font>

107
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:46,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm taking on the job that
you're too soft to do.</font>

108
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:51,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that it?</font>

109
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:58,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Travel documentation denied.</font>

110
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:01,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Newt!</font>

111
00:13:03,364 --> 00:13:04,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I like
the idea of Grimmson</font>

112
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:06,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- any more than you do?
- Listen, I don't want to hear</font>

113
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how the ends
justify the means, Theseus.</font>

114
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:09,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you're gonna have to
pull your head out the sand!</font>

115
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, right, here we go. What
a selfish, irresponsible...</font>

116
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:14,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, the time is coming</font>

117
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when everyone, everyone is
gonna have to pick a side.</font>

118
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:18,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even you.</font>

119
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:21,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't do sides.</font>

120
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:27,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Newt. Newt.</font>

121
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:34,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here.</font>

122
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're watching you.</font>

123
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Well, gentlemen,</i></font>

124
00:13:57,484 --> 00:14:00,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I assume this means
I have the job.</font>

125
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:24,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This will be suitable
after a thorough cleanse.</font>

126
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:29,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to
go to the circus now.</font>

127
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:31,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give my note to Credence.</font>

128
00:15:31,912 --> 00:15:33,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Begin his journey.</font>

129
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:37,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we've won, they'll
flee cities in the millions.</font>

130
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've had their time.</font>

131
00:15:38,652 --> 00:15:41,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't say
such things out loud.</font>

132
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:43,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We want only freedom.</font>

133
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freedom to be ourselves.</font>

134
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:48,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To annihilate non-wizards.</font>

135
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:50,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not all of them. Not all.</font>

136
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not merciless.</font>

137
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The beast of burden

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbledore.</font>

140
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Were the less conspicuous
rooftops full, then?</font>

141
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:56,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

142
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:58,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do enjoy a view.</font>

143

144
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How was it?</font>

145
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:10,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're still convinced
that you sent me to New York.</font>

146
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You told them I didn't?</font>

147
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

148
00:18:14,174 --> 00:18:15,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Evening.</font>

149
00:18:15,408 --> 00:18:16,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even though you did.</font>

150
00:18:18,844 --> 00:18:21,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You told me where to find that
trafficked Thunderbird, Dumbledore.</font>

151
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:23,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You knew that
I would take him home,</font>

152
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:24,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you knew I'd have to take
him through a Muggle port.</font>

153
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:27,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've always felt an affinity
with the great magical birds.</font>

154
00:18:27,754 --> 00:18:29,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a story in my family</font>

155
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that a phoenix will come to</font>

156
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">any Dumbledore
in desperate need.</font>

157
00:18:33,493 --> 00:18:37,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They say
my great-grandfather had one.</font>

158
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that it took flight when
he died, never to return.</font>

159
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:41,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With all due respect,
Professor,</font>

160
00:18:41,668 --> 00:18:43,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe for a minute</font>

161
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's why you told me
about the Thunderbird.</font>

162
00:18:52,612 --> 00:18:55,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Credence is in Paris, Newt.</font>

163
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:58,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trying to trace
his real family.</font>

164
00:18:58,185 --> 00:19:02,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I take it you've heard the
rumors about who he really is.</font>

165
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:03,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

166

<font face="Comic Sans MS">The purebloods think</font>

167
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's the last of
an important French line.</font>

168
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:20,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A baby whom
everyone thought lost.</font>

169
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not Leta's brother?</font>

170
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what
they're whispering.</font>

171
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And pureblood or not,
I know this.</font>

172
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:29,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An Obscurus grows
in the absence of love</font>

173
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:32,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a dark twin,
an only friend.</font>

174
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Credence has
a real brother or sister</font>

175
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:36,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">out there
that can take its place,</font>

176
00:19:36,923 --> 00:19:39,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he might yet be saved.</font>

177
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:42,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wherever Credence is in Paris,
he's either in danger</font>

178
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:44,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or a danger to others.</font>

179
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:49,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We may not know who he is yet,
but he needs to be found.</font>

180
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:52,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I rather hope you might
be the one to find him.</font>

181
00:19:57,543 --> 00:19:59,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

182
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:03,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An address of a very old
acquaintance of mine.</font>

183
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:07,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A safe house in Paris
reinforced with enchantments.</font>

184
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:09,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Safe house? Why would
I need a safe house in Paris?</font>

185
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:11,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One hopes you won't,
but should things</font>

186
00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:13,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at some point
go terribly wrong,</font>

187
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:15,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's good to
have a place to go.</font>

188
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:17,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, for a cup of tea.</font>

189
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no, no.</font>

190
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:21,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely not.</font>

191
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:23,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, 'cause I'm banned from
international travel, Dumbledore.</font>

192
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:25,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I leave the country,
they will put me in Azkaban,</font>

193
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:26,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they will
throw away the key.</font>

194
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:28,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know why
I admire you, Newt?</font>

195
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:29,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

196
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:32,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More, perhaps,
than any man I know.</font>

197
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:36,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do not seek power.</font>

198
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:39,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or popularity.</font>

199
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:43,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You simply ask,
is a thing right in itself.</font>

200
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:48,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it is, you do it
no matter the cost.</font>

201
00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:49,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all very well,
Dumbledore,</font>

202
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:52,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but forgive me for asking.
Why can't you go?</font>

203
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:00,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot move
against Grindelwald.</font>

204
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:05,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It has to be you.</font>

205
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:13,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I can't blame you.</font>

206
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:16,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In your shoes,
I'd probably refuse too.</font>

207
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:17,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- It's late.</font>

208
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:18,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good evening, Newt.</font>

209
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:19,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, no.</font>

210
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:22,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on.</font>

211
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:38,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbledore.</font>

212
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:44,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bunty!</font>

213
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bunty!</font>

214
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bunty. Bunty, the baby
Nifflers are loose again.</font>

215
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:07,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done.</font>

216
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:09,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry, Newt.</font>

217
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:10,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They must've picked the lock
while I was cleaning out</font>

218
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:11,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- the Augureys.
- Not to worry.</font>

219
00:23:18,477 --> 00:23:19,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fed nearly everyone.</font>

220
00:23:19,946 --> 00:23:21,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pinky's had
his nose drops and...</font>

221
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:22,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Elsie?</font>

222
00:23:22,782 --> 00:23:24,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsie's droppings
are nearly normal again.</font>

223
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:26,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wonderful.</font>

224
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:29,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can, um...
You can clock off now.</font>

225
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:33,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you to
leave the Kelpie to me.</font>

226
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:34,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That wound
needs more ointment.</font>

227
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:36,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want you
losing fingers over it.</font>

228
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:49,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously,
you go home now, Bunty.</font>

229
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:51,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must be exhausted.</font>

230
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:54,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know the Kelpie's
easier with two.</font>

231
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:00,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps you should
take off your shirt.</font>

232
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:04,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry.</font>

233
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:06,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll dry off quick enough.</font>

234
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:50,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone needed to
let off some steam.</font>

235
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:51,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ointment, Bunty.</font>

236
00:24:58,512 --> 00:25:01,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bite Bunty again, and
there'll be trouble, mister.</font>

237
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>

238
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:07,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

239
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:11,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I want you to
go home now, Bunty.</font>

240
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:12,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shall I call the Ministry?
- No.</font>

241
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:14,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to go home. Please.</font>

242
00:25:23,403 --> 00:25:24,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just give me
the pieces.</font>

243
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:26,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got it.
- Honey, if you could</font>

244
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:28,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- just give it to me...
- He doesn't care.</font>

245
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:31,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you could just give this
to me, sweetheart.</font>

246
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:38,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

247
00:25:38,952 --> 00:25:42,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Newt! Get over here,
you maniac.</font>

248
00:25:42,188 --> 00:25:44,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We hope you don't mind, Newt.</font>

249
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:45,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We let ourselves in.</font>

250
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:48,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's rainin' out there,
cats and dogs.</font>

251
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:50,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">London's cold.</font>

252
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:51,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were supposed to
have been Obliviated.</font>

253
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:53,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

254
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It didn't work, pal.</font>

255
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:56,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you said it.</font>

256
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:58,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The potion
only erases bad memories.</font>

257
00:25:58,605 --> 00:25:59,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't have any.</font>

258
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:01,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, don't get me wrong.
I had some weird ones,</font>

259
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I had some scary ones.</font>

260
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this angel...</font>

261
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:07,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This angel over here,</font>

262
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:10,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she filled me in on
all the bad parts,</font>

263
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:12,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and here we are, I guess, huh?</font>

264
00:26:12,284 --> 00:26:14,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is wonderful.</font>

265
00:26:17,157 --> 00:26:18,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. Is...</font>

266
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:23,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tina? Tina?</font>

267
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's just us, honey.</font>

268
00:26:28,201 --> 00:26:29,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me and Jacob.</font>

269
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:31,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

270
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:33,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't I
make us some dinner, huh?</font>

271
00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:34,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

272
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:40,344

<font face="Comic Sans MS">She is forced to become...</font>

410
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:13,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She is forced to become...</font>

411
00:36:22,293 --> 00:36:26,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over time, she will not
be able to transform back.</font>

412
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:32,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She will be forever trapped
in the body of a snake.</font>

413
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Credence!</font>

414
00:37:16,815 --> 00:37:18,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pack it up.</font>

415
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Paris is done for us now.</font>

416
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:52,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The boy with the Maledictus,
what do you know about him?</font>

417
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:57,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's looking for his mother.</font>

418
00:37:57,922 --> 00:38:00,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All my freaks
think they can go home.</font>

419
00:38:03,594 --> 00:38:04,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's go.</font>

420
00:38:21,748 --> 00:38:23,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I think you and I
were at the circus</font>

421
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:25,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the same reason,
<i>Monsieur...</i></font>

422
00:38:25,851 --> 00:38:27,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kama. Yusuf Kama.</font>

423
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:30,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you think right.</font>

424
00:38:30,522 --> 00:38:31,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want
with Credence?</font>

425
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:33,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The same as you.
- Which is?</font>

426
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:35,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To prove
who the boy really is.</font>

427
00:38:39,232 --> 00:38:41,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the rumors of his identity
are correct,</font>

428
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:45,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he and I are,
distantly, related.</font>

429
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:48,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am the last male
of my pure-blooded line,</font>

430
00:38:48,775 --> 00:38:51,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and so, if the rumors
are correct, is he.</font>

431
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:57,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you read <i>The Predictions
of Tycho Dodonus?</i></font>

432
00:38:57,748 --> 00:39:01,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. But that's poetry,
not proof.</font>

433
00:39:01,353 --> 00:39:02,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

434
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:06,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I could show you
something better,</font>

435
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">more concrete, something
that proves who he is,</font>

436
00:39:12,063 --> 00:39:15,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would the Ministries of Europe
and America let him live?</font>

437
00:39:16,735 --> 00:39:18,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They might.</font>

438
00:39:20,205 --> 00:39:21,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then come.</font>

439
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:47,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

440
00:39:50,902 --> 00:39:52,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Credence Barebone.</font>

441
00:39:54,906 --> 00:39:58,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nearly destroyed by
the woman who raised him.</font>

442
00:39:58,944 --> 00:40:01,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yet now he seeks
the mother who bore him.</font>

443
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:04,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's desperate for family.</font>

444
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:07,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's desperate for love.</font>

445
00:40:08,688 --> 00:40:12,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's the key to our victory.</font>

446
00:40:12,157 --> 00:40:14,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we know where
the boy is, don't we?</font>

447
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't we grab him
and leave?</font>

448
00:40:16,962 --> 00:40:19,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must come to me freely,</font>

449
00:40:19,598 --> 00:40:22,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he will.</font>

450
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:26,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The path has been laid,
and he is following it.</font>

451
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:31,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The trail that
will lead him to me</font>

452
00:40:31,177 --> 00:40:35,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the strange and
glorious truth of who he is.</font>

453
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is he so important?</font>

454
00:40:44,056 --> 00:40:49,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who represents the greatest
threat to our cause?</font>

455
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Albus Dumbledore.</font>

456
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:53,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I asked you now</font>

457
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:57,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to go to the school where he
is hiding and kill him for me,</font>

458
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would you do it for me, Krall?</font>

459
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:08,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Credence is
the only entity alive</font>

460
00:41:09,848 --> 00:41:11,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who can kill him.</font>

461
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:15,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really think
he can kill the Great...</font>

462
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:20,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can kill Albus Dumbledore?</font>

463
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:23,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know he can.</font>

464
00:41:23,228 --> 00:41:27,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But will you be with us
when that happens, Krall?</font>

465
00:41:30,536 --> 00:41:31,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you?</font>

466
00:41:43,982 --> 00:41:46,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob, that man
Tina's been seeing...</font>

467
00:41:46,018 --> 00:41:47,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry.
She's gonna see you</font>

468
00:41:47,585 --> 00:41:49,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she'll see
the four of us together,</font>

469
00:41:49,688 --> 00:41:51,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it'll be just like New York all over again.
Don't worry about it.</font>

470
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:52,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but he's
an Auror, Queenie said.</font>

471
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:54,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he's
an Auror. So what?</font>

472
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:55,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry about him.</font>

473
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think I should
say to her if I see her?</font>

474
00:42:02,668 --> 00:42:07,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, it's best
not to plan these things.</font>

475
00:42:07,072 --> 00:42:08,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, you just say</font>

476
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whatever comes to you
in the moment.</font>

477
00:42:14,513 --> 00:42:17,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She has eyes
just like a salamander.</font>

478
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:19,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't say that.</font>

479
00:42:23,288 --> 00:42:26,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you just
tell her that you missed her.</font>

480
00:42:26,558 --> 00:42:27,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right.
- Right, and then</font>

481
00:42:27,793 --> 00:42:31,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you came all the way
to Paris just to find her.</font>

482
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:34,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll love that. And then</font>

483
00:42:34,433 --> 00:42:36,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">tell her you're losing
sleep at night</font>

484
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:39,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for thinking of her and...</font>

485
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just don't say nothing about
no salamanders, all right?</font>

486
00:42:41,507 --> 00:42:43,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

487
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Hey, hey.</font>

488
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna be all right.</font>

489
00:42:47,813 --> 00:42:49,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in this together, pal.</font>

490
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'm gonna help you out.
I'm gonna help you find Tina,</font>

491
00:42:51,984 --> 00:42:53,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">find Queenie,</font>

492
00:42:53,886 --> 00:42:56,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we'll all be happy again,
just like old times.</font>

493
00:42:56,389 --> 00:42:57,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is this guy?</font>

494
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:00,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, he's the only way</font>

495
00:43:00,692 --> 00:43:02,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can leave the country
without documentation.</font>

496
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:05,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you don't suffer from
motion sickness, do you?</font>

497
00:43:05,531 --> 00:43:07,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't do well
on boats, Newt.</font>

498
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:09,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be fine.</font>

499
00:43:09,735 --> 00:43:11,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stir your
stumps. Leaves in one minute.</font>

500
00:43:13,005 --> 00:43:14,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">50 Galleons.</font>

501
00:43:14,206 --> 00:43:15,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we said 30.</font>

502
00:43:15,975 --> 00:43:17,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh. 30 to go to France.</font>

503
00:43:17,442 --> 00:43:21,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">20 not to tell anyone
I seen Newt Scamander</font>

504
00:43:21,013 --> 00:43:22,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">leaving the country illegally.</font>

505
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:25,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Price of fame, pal.</font>

506
00:43:30,723 --> 00:43:32,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. 10 seconds.</font>

507
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:34,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 8.
- Jacob.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">1.</font>

514
00:43:56,449 --> 00:43:58,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't like
that Portkey, Newt.</font>

515
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:00,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you keep saying.</font>

516
00:44:00,552 --> 00:44:01,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

517
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Confundus.</i></font>

518
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:16,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. It'll wear off
in a few minutes.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Appare vestigium.</i></font>

522
00:44:39,592 --> 00:44:41,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oi! Get looking.</font>

523
00:44:44,628 --> 00:44:46,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a Kappa.</font>

524
00:44:46,431 --> 00:44:48,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a Japanese water demon.</font>

525
00:44:53,105 --> 00:44:54,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tina?</font>

526
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tina!</font>

527
00:45:02,813 --> 00:45:04,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you found?</font>

528
00:45:08,286 --> 00:45:10,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we're licking
the dirt now.</font>

00:45:24,101 --> 00:45:25,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Revelio.</i></font>

530
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:29,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Newt, what made those?</font>

531
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:32,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is a Zouwu.</font>

532
00:45:34,779 --> 00:45:36,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a Chinese creature.</font>

533
00:45:36,447 --> 00:45:39,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are incredibly fast
and incredibly powerful.</font>

534
00:45:39,217 --> 00:45:41,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They can travel
1,000 miles in a day,</font>

535
00:45:41,853 --> 00:45:43,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and this one could take you</font>

00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:50,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, good boy.</font>

538
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:54,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob, she was here.</font>

539
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:55,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tina stood here.</font>

540
00:45:55,699 --> 00:45:58,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She has incredibly narrow
feet. Have you noticed?</font>

541
00:46:00,071 --> 00:46:01,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't say that I have.</font>

542
00:46:05,509 --> 00:46:07,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then someone came towards her.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right. Follow that feather.
- What?</font>

545
00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:28,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jacob, follow the feather.
- Follow the feather.</font>

546
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:31,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is he? Ah!</font>

547
00:46:31,737 --> 00:46:33,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Accio Niffler.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop the bucket.</font>

549
00:47:21,618 --> 00:47:24,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, I don't know
what you just said at all.</font>

550
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:27,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to
the French Ministry of Magic.</font>

551
00:47:27,525 --> 00:47:30,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is your business, please?</font>

552
00:47:30,362 --> 00:47:34,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to
speak to Tina Goldstein.</font>

553
00:47:34,165 --> 00:47:39,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's an American Auror
working on a case here.</font>

554
00:47:44,176 --> 00:47:46,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have
no Tina Goldstein here.</font>

555
00:47:46,712 --> 00:47:49,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm sorry. There must
be some sort of mistake.</font>

556
00:47:49,547 --> 00:47:52,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, I know she's in Paris.
She sent me a postcard.</font>

557
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:54,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I brought it.
I can show it to you. Here.</font>

558
00:47:54,587 --> 00:47:56,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you can help me
find it here.</font>

559
00:47:56,188 --> 00:47:58,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just in here.</font>

560
00:47:58,357 --> 00:48:00,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rabbits! If you can
just wait one moment!</font>

561
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:03,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's in here somewhere.
I definitely packed it.</font>

562
00:48:03,795 --> 00:48:05,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is it?</font>

563
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One second.</font>

564
00:48:06,531 --> 00:48:08,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did I do with you?</font>

565
00:48:43,034 --> 00:48:44,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could we at least
stop for coffee or...</font>

566
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:46,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not now, Jacob.</font>

567
00:48:46,103 --> 00:48:48,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Chocolat chaud or...
Just for a second.</i></font>

568
00:48:52,877 --> 00:48:54,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't know.
- This way. Come on.</font>

569
00:48:54,645 --> 00:48:58,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pain au chocolat?
Half a croissant and a bonbon?</font>

570
00:48:58,248 --> 00:48:59,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way.</font>

571
00:49:04,656 --> 00:49:06,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob!</font>

572
00:49:19,837 --> 00:49:21,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob?</font>

573
00:51:03,641 --> 00:51:05,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's home.</font>

574
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:53,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you Irma?</font>

575
00:51:55,427 --> 00:51:57,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you Irma Dugard?</font>

576
00:51:58,862 --> 00:52:03,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. Your name is
on my adoption paper.</font>

577
00:52:05,268 --> 00:52:06,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does this make sense?</font>

578
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:11,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gave me to
Mrs. Barebone in New York.</font>

579
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not your mother.</font>

580
00:52:32,697 --> 00:52:34,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was only a servant.</font>

581
00:52:38,402 --> 00:52:40,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were so beautiful a baby.</font>

582
00:52:43,241 --> 00:52:45,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you are a beautiful man.</font>

583
00:52:55,853 --> 00:52:58,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did not want
to leave you there.</font>

584
00:52:58,822 --> 00:53:00,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't they want me?</font>

585
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:08,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is your name
on my adoption paper?</font>

586
00:53:08,467 --> 00:53:11,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took you to Mrs. Barebone</font>

587
00:53:13,038 --> 00:53:15,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because she was supposed
to look after you.</font>

588
00:55:22,868 --> 00:55:24,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's dead.</font>

589
00:55:26,904 --> 00:55:29,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did the boy take it?</font>

590
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's sensitive.</font>

591
00:55:33,578 --> 00:55:36,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Ministry won't be happy
when I tell them I missed.</font>

592
00:55:37,915 --> 00:55:39,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know my reputation.</font>

593
00:55:39,484 --> 00:55:42,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me.
The disapproval of cowards</font>

594
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is praise to the brave.</font>

595
00:55:44,723 --> 00:55:47,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your name will be
written in glory</font>

596
00:55:47,426 --> 00:55:50,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when wizards rule the world.</font>

597
00:55:50,828 --> 00:55:54,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the clock
is ticking faster.</font>

598
00:55:54,031 --> 00:55:57,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You watch over Credence.
Keep him safe.</font>

599
00:55:58,768 --> 00:56:00,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the greater good.</font>

600
00:56:01,906 --> 00:56:04,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the greater good.</font>

601
00:56:06,511 --> 00:56:08,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know
what I miss about Queenie?</font>

602
00:56:10,949 --> 00:56:12,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything.</font>

603
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:17,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I even miss the stuff
that drove me nuts.</font>

604
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:19,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like the mind reading.</font>

605
00:56:25,397 --> 00:56:27,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was lucky to have
someone like her</font>

606
00:56:27,132 --> 00:56:30,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">even interested in
anything I thought.</font>

607
00:56:32,435 --> 00:56:34,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I mean?</font>

608
00:56:35,172 --> 00:56:36,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry?</font>

609
00:56:41,145 --> 00:56:43,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was saying,
you're sure the guy is here</font>

610
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:44,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we're looking for?</font>

611
00:56:44,516 --> 00:56:47,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, definitely.
The feather says so.</font>

612
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that the guy
we're looking for?</font>

613
00:57:18,815 --> 00:57:20,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

614
00:57:22,386 --> 00:57:23,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh...</font>

615
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:26,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

616
00:57:30,661 --> 00:57:32,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wait, no.
Sorry. So we actually...</font>

617
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:34,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were just wondering</font>

618
00:57:34,232 --> 00:57:36,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you'd come across
a friend of ours.</font>

619
00:57:36,634 --> 00:57:38,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tina Goldstein.</font>

620
00:57:38,101 --> 00:57:40,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Monsieur,</i>
Paris is a large city.</font>

621
00:57:40,503 --> 00:57:41,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's an Auror.</font>

622
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:44,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when Aurors
go missing,</font>

623
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:47,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">well, the Ministry tend
to come looking, so...</font>

624
00:57:48,411 --> 00:57:50,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I suppose it would
probably be better</font>

625
00:57:50,214 --> 00:57:51,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if we just report her absence.</font>

626
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:53,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is she tall?</font>

627
00:57:54,985 --> 00:57:56,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dark? Rather...</font>

628
00:57:56,286 --> 00:57:58,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Intense.
- Beautiful. She's...</font>

629
00:57:58,389 --> 00:58:00,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah,
what I meant to say was...</font>

630
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:03,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, she's very, very pretty.
- She's intense too.</font>

631
00:58:03,427 --> 00:58:07,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I saw someone
like this last night.</font>

632
00:58:09,032 --> 00:58:10,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps if I showed
you where...</font>

633
00:58:10,935 --> 00:58:12,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you wouldn't mind.
That would be...</font>

634
00:58:13,337 --> 00:58:15,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That would be lovely.
- Sure.</font>

Mr. Scamander.</font>

639
00:59:04,455 --> 00:59:08,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shall return and release you
once Credence is dead.</font>

00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:09,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kama, wait.</font>

641
00:59:09,259 --> 00:59:13,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see,
either he dies or I do.</font>

646
00:59:32,449 --> 00:59:35,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just lost me my only lead.</font>

647
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:36,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, how was
the interrogation going</font>

648
00:59:36,786 --> 00:59:38,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before we turned up?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Newt!</font>

650

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done, Pick.</font>

651
00:59:50,835 --> 00:59:52,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you need this man,
you said?</font>

652
00:59:53,371 --> 00:59:54,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

653
00:59:54,672 --> 00:59:58,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think he knows where
Credence is, Mr. Scamander.</font>

654
01:00:02,147 --> 01:00:03,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that'll be that Zouwu.</font>

655
01:00:23,902 --> 01:00:25,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Newt.
Get outta there.</font>

656
01:01:17,922 --> 01:01:19,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

657
01:01:51,156 --> 01:01:53,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were
the three biggest mistakes</font>

658
01:01:53,056 --> 01:01:55,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you made last time?</font>

659
01:01:56,427 --> 01:01:58,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Caught by surprise, sir.
- Mmm.</font>

660
01:01:58,529 --> 01:01:59,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What else?</font>

661
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:01,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't parry
before counter-curse, sir.</font>

662
01:02:01,165 --> 01:02:04,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very good. The last one?</font>

663
01:02:04,235 --> 01:02:07,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The most important one?</font>

664
01:02:13,643 --> 01:02:16,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not learning
from the first two.</font>

665
01:02:19,217 --> 01:02:21,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a school.
You've no right.</font>

666

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the Head
of Magical Law Enforcement.</font>

go wherever I please.</font>

please.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

675
01:02:58,489 --> 01:03:00,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut the pretense. I know
he's there on your orders.</font>

676
01:03:00,657 --> 01:03:02,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, if you'd ever had
the pleasure to teach him,</font>

677
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'd know Newt is not
a great follower of orders.</font>

683
01:03:20,744 --> 01:03:22,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a rumor
this prediction</font>

684
01:03:22,378 --> 01:03:24,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">refers to the Obscurial.</font>

01:03:24,815 --> 01:03:26,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They say that
Grindelwald wants...</font>

686

<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a highborn henchman.
I've heard the rumor.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yet, Scamander appears
wherever the Obscurial goes,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">to protect him.</font>

689
01:03:35,326 --> 01:03:36,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meanwhile, you've built up</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're not going to discover
plots against you, Travers,</font>

694
01:03:46,804 --> 01:03:48,871

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not interested

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now,</font>

700
01:04:07,424 --> 01:04:10,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it pains me to say it because,</font>

01:04:36,888 --> 01:04:38,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because of this?</font>

707
01:04:46,697 --> 01:04:49,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and Grindelwald were
as close as brothers.</font>

708
01:04:50,967 --> 01:04:53,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, we were
closer than brothers.</font>

709
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you fight him?</font>

710
01:05:08,217 --> 01:05:09,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't.</font>

711
01:05:10,955 --> 01:05:13,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then you have
chosen your side.</font>

712
01:05:16,127 --> 01:05:19,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From now on, I shall know
every spell you cast.</font>

713

718
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">don't try and break it up.</font>

719
01:05:41,585 --> 01:05:43,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let Travers
send you in there.</font>

720
01:05:45,322 --> 01:05:46,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you ever trusted me...</font>

She's so annoying.</font>

01:07:02,031 --> 01:07:05,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Children, stop it!
You, stop! Come back!</font>

739

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Out of my way!
- Where has she gone?</font>

740
01:07:07,938 --> 01:07:09,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think
she went that way!</font>

741
01:07:12,909 --> 01:07:14,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss, it was Lestrange.
She's horrible.</font>

742
01:07:24,587 --> 01:07:27,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scamander,
why aren't you packing?</font>

743
01:07:27,123 --> 01:07:28,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going home.</font>

744
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:31,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

745
01:07:31,462 --> 01:07:33,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He needs me.</font>

01:07:38,969 --> 01:07:40,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was hurt.</font>

747
01:07:47,444 --> 01:07:49,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

748
01:07:49,513 --> 01:07:51,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A raven chick.</font>

749
01:07:52,616 --> 01:07:55,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't the raven
your family emblem?</font>

750
01:07:55,018 --> 01:07:56,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it is.</font>

753
01:08:17,107 --> 01:08:18,741

754
01:08:18,743 --> 01:08:21,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Mr. Scamander fears what</font>

755
01:08:21,645 --> 01:08:23,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">more than anything else
in the world?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Having to work
in an office, sir.</font>

757
01:08:26,383 --> 01:08:28,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead, Newt.</font>

01:08:39,695 --> 01:08:41,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's only a Boggart.</font>

762
01:08:41,231 --> 01:08:43,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can't hurt you.</font>

763
01:08:45,035 --> 01:08:47,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone is
scared of something.</font>

764
01:08:49,072 --> 01:08:51,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been looking
forward to this.</font>

765
01:09:35,619 --> 01:09:37,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to talk about it.</font>

766
01:09:53,335 --> 01:09:54,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They know me,</font>

767
01:09:55,771 --> 01:09:57,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or they'd hide.</font>

768
01:10:00,143 --> 01:10:02,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They only nest in trees
with wand-quality wood.</font>

769
01:10:04,647 --> 01:10:06,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know that?</font>

770
01:10:08,017 --> 01:10:12,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they have
very complex social lives.</font>

771
01:10:12,188 --> 01:10:15,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you watch them for
long enough, you realize...</font>

772
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:36,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Leta.
This is a surprise.</font>

773
01:10:39,749 --> 01:10:41,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finding me in a classroom?</font>

774
01:10:43,553 --> 01:10:44,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was I such a bad student?</font>

775
01:10:44,989 --> 01:10:46,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the contrary,
you were one of my cleverest.</font>

776
01:10:46,889 --> 01:10:48,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said bad, not stupid.</font>

777
01:10:54,498 --> 01:10:56,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't bother answering.</font>

778
01:10:57,566 --> 01:10:58,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you never liked me.</font>

779
01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:00,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you're wrong.</font>

780
01:11:00,937 --> 01:11:02,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never thought you bad.</font>

781
01:11:02,306 --> 01:11:05,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were alone, then.
Everybody else did.</font>

782
01:11:05,508 --> 01:11:07,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they were right.</font>

783
01:11:08,277 --> 01:11:10,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was wicked.</font>

784
01:11:10,548 --> 01:11:12,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leta, I know how painful
the rumors about</font>

785
01:11:12,682 --> 01:11:14,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your brother Corvus
must be for you.</font>

786
01:11:14,651 --> 01:11:16,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you don't.</font>

787
01:11:17,387 --> 01:11:20,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not unless you had
a brother who died, too.</font>

788
01:11:20,089 --> 01:11:22,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my case, it was my sister.</font>

789
01:11:25,395 --> 01:11:27,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you love her?</font>

790
01:11:35,606 --> 01:11:37,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not as well as
I should have done.</font>

791
01:11:41,143 --> 01:11:43,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never too late
to free yourself.</font>

792
01:11:45,315 --> 01:11:50,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Confession is a relief, I'm
told. A great weight lifted.</font>

793
01:11:53,923 --> 01:11:56,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Regret is
my constant companion.</font>

794
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not let it become yours.</font>

795
01:12:09,807 --> 01:12:11,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! No, thank you.</font>

796
01:12:11,842 --> 01:12:15,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you've been really kind,</font>

797
01:12:15,277 --> 01:12:19,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but my sister Tina's probably
worried sick about me.</font>

798
01:12:19,549 --> 01:12:22,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, banging on
all the doors and things,</font>

799
01:12:24,187 --> 01:12:25,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I think
I'd better be going.</font>

800
01:12:25,556 --> 01:12:28,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you haven't met your host.</font>

801
01:12:28,357 --> 01:12:30,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, are you married?</font>

802
01:12:30,694 --> 01:12:32,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's say,</font>

803
01:12:33,297 --> 01:12:35,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">deeply committed.</font>

804
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, I can't tell if you're
making a joke or if you're just...</font>

805
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,473

806
01:12:49,478 --> 01:12:50,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

807
01:12:53,049 --> 01:12:56,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, knock it off.</font>

808
01:13:03,026 --> 01:13:04,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stay right there.</font>

809
01:13:04,928 --> 01:13:06,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you are.</font>

810
01:13:07,731 --> 01:13:09,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Queenie.</font>

811
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are not here to hurt you.</font>

812
01:13:12,901 --> 01:13:14,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We only want to help you.</font>

813
01:13:16,339 --> 01:13:19,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're so very,
very far away from home.</font>

814
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:21,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Far away from
everything you love.</font>

815
01:13:21,977 --> 01:13:24,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything
that is comfortable.</font>

816
01:13:26,549 --> 01:13:29,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would never see you harmed.</font>

817
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:31,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever.</font>

818
01:13:32,422 --> 01:13:36,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is not your fault
that your sister is an Auror.</font>

819
01:13:38,329 --> 01:13:41,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish you were working
with me now,</font>

820
01:13:41,164 --> 01:13:43,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">towards a world
where we wizards</font>

821
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">were free to live openly.</font>

822
01:13:47,971 --> 01:13:50,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To love freely.</font>

823
01:14:01,785 --> 01:14:03,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are an innocent.</font>

824
01:14:05,955 --> 01:14:07,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So go now.</font>

825
01:14:09,392 --> 01:14:11,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave this place.</font>

826
01:15:33,944 --> 01:15:38,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Newt, buddy.</font>

827
01:15:38,147 --> 01:15:40,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tina's up here.
She's all by her lonesome,</font>

828
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:43,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and maybe you want to come up
and keep her company?</font>

829
01:15:43,853 --> 01:15:47,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been looking for food
and I ain't found any,</font>

830
01:15:48,525 --> 01:15:50,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I guess I'm gonna
go upstairs and try my luck</font>

831
01:15:50,459 --> 01:15:53,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the, oh, I don't know,
the attic.</font>

832
01:15:54,298 --> 01:15:55,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're all right.</font>

833
01:15:55,898 --> 01:15:57,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Relashio.</i></font>

834
01:16:03,374 --> 01:16:04,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

835
01:16:17,053 --> 01:16:19,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's responded well
to the Dittany.</font>

836
01:16:20,156 --> 01:16:22,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was born to run, you see.</font>

837
01:16:22,325 --> 01:16:26,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I think she's just
lacking in confidence.</font>

838
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:28,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Scamander,
have you got anything</font>

839
01:16:28,097 --> 01:16:29,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in your case that might help
revive this man?</font>

840
01:16:30,334 --> 01:16:31,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to question him.</font>

841
01:16:31,602 --> 01:16:33,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think he knows
who Credence really is.</font>

842
01:16:33,169 --> 01:16:34,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the scars on his hand</font>

843
01:16:34,637 --> 01:16:36,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- suggest an Unbreakable Vow.
- An Unbreakable Vow.</font>

844
01:16:36,271 --> 01:16:38,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I noticed that, too.</font>

845
01:16:49,819 --> 01:16:51,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Lumos.</i></font>

846
01:16:58,027 --> 01:16:59,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>

847
01:16:59,428 --> 01:17:02,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There must be
a Water Dragon in that sewer.</font>

848
01:17:02,665 --> 01:17:06,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They carry these parasites,
you see. They, um...</font>

849
01:17:06,102 --> 01:17:09,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jacob.
- Yeah?</font>

850
01:17:09,373 --> 01:17:11,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my case,
in the pocket there,</font>

851
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:13,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'll find
a pair of tweezers.</font>

852
01:17:13,076 --> 01:17:14,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tweezers?</font>

853
01:17:14,611 --> 01:17:16,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're thin, pointy...
- Little pointy things.</font>

854
01:17:16,545 --> 01:17:18,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes,
I know what tweezers are.</font>

855
01:17:20,816 --> 01:17:22,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. You might not
want to watch this.</font>

856
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can handle it.</font>

857
01:17:29,825 --> 01:17:31,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come out.</font>

858
01:17:31,328 --> 01:17:33,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. You're all right.</font>

859
01:17:33,896 --> 01:17:37,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ew.
- Come on. I got you.</font>

860
01:17:37,532 --> 01:17:39,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob, will you
take that for me?</font>

861
01:17:39,136 --> 01:17:41,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh. Ugh!</font>

862
01:17:43,406 --> 01:17:44,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calamari.</font>

863
01:17:46,977 --> 01:17:48,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must kill him.</font>

864
01:17:48,977 --> 01:17:50,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who?</font>

865
01:17:50,146 --> 01:17:52,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Credence?</font>

866
01:17:52,781 --> 01:17:54,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It may take him
a few hours to recover.</font>

867
01:17:54,616 --> 01:17:58,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That parasite's poison
is quite strong.</font>

868
01:17:58,422 --> 01:18:00,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to go back to the
Ministry with what I've got.</font>

869
01:18:02,726 --> 01:18:04,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's nice to see you again,
Mr. Scamander.</font>

870
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:06,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Hey,
hold on a second, will ya?</font>

871
01:18:06,829 --> 01:18:08,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, hold on, hold on.</font>

872
01:18:08,499 --> 01:18:10,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! Tina.</font>

873
01:18:14,838 --> 01:18:16,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't mention
salamanders, did you?</font>

874
01:18:16,638 --> 01:18:19,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I didn't.
She just ran. I don't know...</font>

875
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:23,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you chase after her.</font>

876
01:18:23,312 --> 01:18:26,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tina. Please,
just listen to me.</font>

877
01:18:26,516 --> 01:18:29,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Scamander, I need to
go talk to the Ministry.</font>

878
01:18:29,785 --> 01:18:32,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how you feel
about Aurors.</font>

879
01:18:32,188 --> 01:18:33,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I may have been
a little strong in the way</font>

880
01:18:33,522 --> 01:18:34,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I expressed myself
in that letter.</font>

881
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:36,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was the exact phrase?</font>

882
01:18:36,226 --> 01:18:38,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"A bunch of
careerist hypocrites"?</font>

883
01:18:38,262 --> 01:18:39,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, but I can't
admire people</font>

884
01:18:39,596 --> 01:18:41,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whose answer to everything
that they fear</font>

885
01:18:41,264 --> 01:18:42,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or misunderstand
is "kill it."</font>

886
01:18:42,999 --> 01:18:44,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an Auror and I don't.</font>

887
01:18:44,468 --> 01:18:46,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I know. That's because
you've gone middle head.</font>

888
01:18:48,637 --> 01:18:50,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me?</font>

889
01:18:50,272 --> 01:18:51,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an expression
derived from</font>

890
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:52,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the three heads
of the Runespoor.</font>

891
01:18:52,575 --> 01:18:54,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So the middle one
is the visionary.</font>

892
01:18:54,343 --> 01:18:56,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, every Auror in Europe
wants Credence dead, except you.</font>

893
01:18:56,279 --> 01:18:57,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've gone middle head.</font>

894
01:18:59,215 --> 01:19:02,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who else uses that expression,
Mr. Scamander?</font>

895
01:19:03,419 --> 01:19:05,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it might just be me.</font>

896
01:19:23,505 --> 01:19:26,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Grindelwald.
He's calling his followers.</font>

897
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:58,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too late. Grindelwald
has come for Credence.</font>

898
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:02,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He might already have him.
- It's not too late.</font>

899
01:20:02,544 --> 01:20:04,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can still get to him first.</font>

900
01:20:06,782 --> 01:20:08,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going?</font>

901
01:20:08,218 --> 01:20:09,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The French Ministry of Magic.</font>

902
01:20:09,752 --> 01:20:11,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the last place
Credence would go.</font>

903
01:20:11,821 --> 01:20:14,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a box hidden
in the Ministry, Tina.</font>

904
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:16,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a box that can tell us
who Credence really is.</font>

905
01:20:16,825 --> 01:20:19,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A box?
What are you talking about?</font>

906
01:20:19,629 --> 01:20:20,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me.</font>

907
01:20:23,932 --> 01:20:26,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna come out,
just for a little while?</font>

908
01:20:26,736 --> 01:20:28,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can be free.</font>

909
01:20:36,713 --> 01:20:37,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Credence.</font>

910
01:20:46,255 --> 01:20:47,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

911
01:20:47,356 --> 01:20:48,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From you?</font>

912
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:50,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

913
01:20:53,695 --> 01:20:54,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you?</font>

914
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything I never had.</font>

915
01:20:59,669 --> 01:21:02,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what is it you want,
my boy?</font>

916
01:21:03,839 --> 01:21:05,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to know who I am.</font>

917
01:21:14,784 --> 01:21:20,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is where you will find
proof of your true identity.</font>

918
01:21:24,995 --> 01:21:27,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come to Pere Lachaise tonight,</font>

919
01:21:27,196 --> 01:21:29,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you will discover
the truth.</font>

920
01:21:46,715 --> 01:21:48,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father, why did you make me...</font>

921
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:52,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait...</font>

922
01:21:54,324 --> 01:21:55,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

923
01:22:17,045 --> 01:22:19,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid we keep
no food in the house.</font>

924
01:22:21,752 --> 01:22:23,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you a ghost?</font>

925
01:22:23,652 --> 01:22:24,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

926
01:22:25,355 --> 01:22:28,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I'm alive.</font>

927
01:22:28,657 --> 01:22:31,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm an alchemist
and therefore immortal.</font>

928
01:22:33,429 --> 01:22:36,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't look a day over 375.</font>

929
01:22:38,901 --> 01:22:40,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry that
we didn't knock.</font>

930
01:22:40,937 --> 01:22:42,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No matter.</font>

931
01:22:42,739 --> 01:22:45,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Albus told me some friends
might be dropping in.</font>

932
01:22:46,174 --> 01:22:47,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nicolas Flamel.</font>

933
01:22:49,312 --> 01:22:50,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

934
01:22:51,446 --> 01:22:52,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob Kowalski.</font>

935
01:22:52,615 --> 01:22:53,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

936
01:22:55,317 --> 01:22:57,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.</font>

937
01:22:57,419 --> 01:22:58,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I didn't...
- Oh...</font>

938
01:22:59,422 --> 01:23:00,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

939
01:23:11,366 --> 01:23:13,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At last, we see
some development.</font>

940
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:15,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I've seen
one of these before.</font>

941
01:23:15,905 --> 01:23:18,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was at the fair.</font>

942
01:23:18,107 --> 01:23:19,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was this dame there
and she had a veil,</font>

943
01:23:19,942 --> 01:23:21,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I gave her a nickel,</font>

944
01:23:21,377 --> 01:23:23,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she told me
about my future.</font>

945
01:23:23,846 --> 01:23:27,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she missed out
on quite a bit, actually.</font>

946
01:23:30,553 --> 01:23:32,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Hey, hey.</font>

947
01:23:33,188 --> 01:23:34,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute, I know him.</font>

948
01:23:34,322 --> 01:23:35,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the kid.
That's Credence.</font>

949
01:23:38,495 --> 01:23:39,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez.</font>

950
01:23:41,397 --> 01:23:43,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey... Hey!</font>

Hi, baby.</font>

952
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:49,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is this? Is this here?</font>

953
01:23:49,371 --> 01:23:51,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.
This is the Lestrange tomb.</font>

954
01:23:51,775 --> 01:23:54,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It lies in the cemetery
of Pere Lachaise.</font>

955
01:23:55,611 --> 01:23:57,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming, baby.
Stay right there.</font>

956
01:23:57,513 --> 01:23:58,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Flamel.</font>

957
01:23:58,847 --> 01:24:02,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ouch.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, look after Mr. Tentacles
for me. Oh, no.</font>

959
01:24:05,687 --> 01:24:07,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I gotta go.</font>

960
01:24:07,156 --> 01:24:08,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, you mustn't
go to the cemetery.</font>

961

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happening?</font>

962
01:24:33,048 --> 01:24:35,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly what
he said would happen.</font>

963
01:24:35,985 --> 01:24:38,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grindelwald rallies
at the cemetery tonight,</font>

964
01:24:38,387 --> 01:24:40,054

in 200 years.</font>

We believe in you.</font>

Records room, Tina.</font>

969
01:24:58,508 --> 01:25:00,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it's three floors down.</font>

01:25:00,142 --> 01:25:01,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that Polyjuice?</font>

971
01:25:01,311 --> 01:25:03,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just enough
to get me inside.</font>

01:25:11,887 --> 01:25:14,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who?
- It's my brother Theseus.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happening?</font>

975
01:25:20,696 --> 01:25:21,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grindelwald's rallying.
We don't know where,</font>

01:25:27,937 --> 01:25:29,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Be careful.
- Of course.</font>

978
01:25:29,771 --> 01:25:30,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Promise me you'll be careful.</font>

979
01:25:30,973 --> 01:25:33,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.
I'm gonna be careful.</font>

980
01:25:33,075 --> 01:25:35,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I want you to
hear this from me.</font>

981
01:25:35,111 --> 01:25:37,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They think that Credence boy
might be your missing brother.</font>

982
01:25:37,379 --> 01:25:39,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My brother is dead.
- I know.</font>

983
01:25:39,148 --> 01:25:40,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He died.
- I know.</font>

984
01:25:40,517 --> 01:25:43,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How many times, Theseus?
- And the records will prove that.</font>

985
01:25:43,785 --> 01:25:46,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? They can't lie.</font>

986
01:25:46,254 --> 01:25:47,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Theseus.</font>

987
01:25:52,895 --> 01:25:54,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want every person
at that rally arrested.</font>

988
01:25:54,763 --> 01:25:55,996

but if we go in too heavy</font>

of adding to the...</font>

01:26:16,753 --> 01:26:18,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't suppose
you can Disapparate</font>

in France, can you?</font>

994
01:26:20,089 --> 01:26:21,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope.</font>

1218
01:46:25,226 --> 01:46:29,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say the Muggles
are not lesser,</font>

1219
01:46:29,897 --> 01:46:31,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but other.</font>

1220
01:46:32,299 --> 01:46:33,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not worthless,</font>

1221
01:46:35,070 --> 01:46:37,938

1222
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:42,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not disposable, but of
a different disposition.</font>

who live for higher things.</font>

1226
01:46:57,458 --> 01:47:01,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and what a world we would
make for all of humanity,</font>

1227
01:47:01,062 --> 01:47:04,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we who live for freedom,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">for truth,</font>

1231
01:47:23,718 --> 01:47:25,420

<font face="Comic Sans MS">We mustn't be
what he says we are.</font>

1233
01:47:34,661 --> 01:47:36,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The moment has come</font>

1234
01:47:36,431 --> 01:47:39,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to share my vision

01:47:41,069 --> 01:47:44,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that awaits
if we do not rise up</font>

1236
01:47:46,107 --> 01:47:48,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and take our rightful place</font>

01:47:49,544 --> 01:47:51,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the world.</font>

1238
01:48:35,389 --> 01:48:37,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not another war.</font>

1239
01:48:42,163 --> 01:48:46,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is what we are fighting.</font>

1240
01:48:47,201 --> 01:48:48,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is the enemy.</font>

1241
01:48:50,672 --> 01:48:52,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their arrogance.</font>

1242
01:48:53,475 --> 01:48:55,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their power lust.</font>

1243
01:48:57,445 --> 01:48:58,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their barbarity.</font>

1244
01:49:00,548 --> 01:49:04,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long will it take before
they turn their weapons on us?</font>

1245
01:49:06,855 --> 01:49:09,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do nothing
when I speak of this.</font>

1246
01:49:10,191 --> 01:49:12,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must remain calm</font>

1247
01:49:14,195 --> 01:49:16,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and contain your emotions.</font>

1248
01:49:20,468 --> 01:49:22,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are Aurors
here among us.</font>

1249
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:35,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come closer, brother wizards.
Join us.</font>

1250
01:49:37,486 --> 01:49:38,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do nothing.</font>

1251
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:41,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And no force.</font>

1252
01:49:56,637 --> 01:50:00,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have killed
many of my followers.</font>

1253
01:50:00,776 --> 01:50:02,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is true.</font>

1254
01:50:03,145 --> 01:50:05,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They confined me</font>

1255
01:50:05,079 --> 01:50:08,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and tortured me in New York.</font>

1256
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:13,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They had struck down their
fellow witches and wizards.</font>

1257
01:50:14,321 --> 01:50:19,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the simple crime
of seeking the truth.</font>

1258
01:50:20,661 --> 01:50:22,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For wanting freedom.</font>

1259
01:50:26,868 --> 01:50:31,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your anger, your desire
for revenge is natural.</font>

1260
01:50:34,642 --> 01:50:35,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1261
01:51:06,473 --> 01:51:10,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take this young warrior
back to her family.</font>

1262
01:51:18,486 --> 01:51:19,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Disapparate.</font>

1263
01:51:20,121 --> 01:51:22,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave.</font>

1264
01:51:22,289 --> 01:51:25,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go forth from this place
and spread the word.</font>

1265
01:51:26,794 --> 01:51:30,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is not we who are violent.</font>

1266
01:51:48,048 --> 01:51:49,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's take him.</font>

1267
01:52:18,312 --> 01:52:22,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aurors, join me
in this circle.</font>

1268
01:52:24,018 --> 01:52:25,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pledge to me</font>

1269
01:52:26,754 --> 01:52:28,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your eternal allegiance</font>

1270
01:52:29,123 --> 01:52:30,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or die.</font>

1271
01:52:30,657 --> 01:52:33,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only here shall
you know freedom.</font>

1272

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only here shall
you know yourself.</font>

1273
01:52:43,271 --> 01:52:44,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Play by the rules!</font>

1274
01:52:44,972 --> 01:52:46,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No cheating, children.</font>

1275
01:52:52,780 --> 01:52:54,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knows who I am.</font>

1276
01:52:54,415 --> 01:52:56,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knows what you were born,</font>

1277

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Queenie, honey. Queenie.
You gotta wake up.</font>

1280

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob.</font>

1281
01:53:20,342 --> 01:53:21,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's the answer.</font>

1282

1283
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:24,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, no, no.
- Yeah.</font>

1284
01:53:34,489 --> 01:53:37,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This has all been for you,
Credence.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

1307
01:56:24,926 --> 01:56:26,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate Paris.</font>

1308
01:57:06,333 --> 01:57:07,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Together, in a circle.</font>

02:01:29,664 --> 02:01:32,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to be careful.</font>
