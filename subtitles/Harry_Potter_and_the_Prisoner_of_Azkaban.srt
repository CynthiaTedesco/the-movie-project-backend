Ig: @cevineo -Sesetan1StreetHacker-

2
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,700
Lumos Maxima.

3
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,750
Lumos Maxima.

4
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,480
Lumos Maxima.

5
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,650
Lumos Maxima.

6
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,530
TAEK LENTONG!!

7
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,520
Harry. Harry.

8
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,680
Harry, open the Taek.

9
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,900
Dane. How lovely to see...

10
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,490
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

11
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,990
What is it?

12
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,280
Nothing. School stuff.

13
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,120
Later perhaps, if you behave.

14
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,500
I will if she does.

15
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,790
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

16
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,840
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,960
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

18
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,470
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

19
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,020
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

20
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,980
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

21
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,440
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

22
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,560
Okay.

23
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,820
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

24
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,780
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

25
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,950
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

26
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,540
A bit more.

27
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,370
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

28
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,170
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

29
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,260
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

30
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,470
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

31
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,770
What are you smirking at?

32
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,770
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

33
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,270
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

34
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,440
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

35
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,240
Oh, yeah.

36
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,110
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

37
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,870
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

38
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,200
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

39
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,500
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

40
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,590
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

41
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,920
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

42
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,090
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

43
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,100
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

44
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,810
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

45
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,900
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

46
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,900
I think it's time you went to bed.

47
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,320
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

48
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,700
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

49
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,660
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

50
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,870
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

51
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,750
Shut up! Shut up!

52
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,510
Right.

53
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,800
Let me tell you...

54
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,370
Vernon!

55
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,200
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

56
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,670
Stop!

57
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,800
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.

58
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,220
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

59
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,300
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

60
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,350
Oh, Vernon.

61
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,270
Oh, God.

62
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,230
Marge!

63
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,490
Please!

64
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,320
Marge!

65
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,580
Come back!

66
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,980
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

67
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,400
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

68
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,990
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.

69
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,200
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

70
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,700
You've nowhere to go.

71
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,200
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

72
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,170
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

73
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,720
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

74
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,850
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."

75
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,020
What you doing down there?

76
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,940
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?

77
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,820
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

78
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,200
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

79
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,370
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

80
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,290
Well, come on, then. In.

81
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,300
No, no, no. I'll get this.
You get in.

82
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,470
Come on.

83
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,110
Come on. Move on, move on.

84
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,120
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

85
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,540
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

86
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,520
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.

87
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,190
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

88
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,320
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

89
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,820
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

90
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,780
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

91
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,830
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

92
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,750
They don't see nothing, do they?

93
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,460
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

94
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,250
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

95
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,560
Ten, nine, eight...

96
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,480
...seven, six, five...

97
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,940
...four, three, three and a half...

98
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,940
...two, one and three quarters.

99
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,110
Yes!

100
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,820
Who is that?

101
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,410
That man.

102
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,870
Who is that?

103
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,580
Who is...?

104
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,170
That is Sirius Black, that is.

105
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,000
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

106
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,590
He's a murderer.

107
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,380
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

108
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:23,470
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

109
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,600
He's the first one that done it.

110
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,190
He was a big supporter of...

111
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,190
...You-Know-Who.

112
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,770
I reckon you've heard of him.

113
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,520
Yeah.

114
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,030
Him I've heard of.

115
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,370
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

116
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,530
They're getting closer, Ernie.

117
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,580
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

118
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,380
Mind your head.

119
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,220
Hey, guys? Guys?

120
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,600
Why the long faces?

121
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,860
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

122
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,700
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

123
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,700
Mr. Potter, at last.

124
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,420
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

125
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,440
Room 11.

126
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,360
Hedwig.

127
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,360
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

128
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,240
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

129
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,790
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

130
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,170
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

131
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,300
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

132
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,220
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

133
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,180
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

134
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:36,060
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

135
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,810
So that's that...

136
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,860
...and no harm done.

137
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,860
Pea soup?

138
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,160
No, thank you.

139
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,530
- Minister?
- Yes?

140
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,450
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

141
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,210
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

142
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,420
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

143
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,130
...for blowing up their aunts.

144
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,640
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

145
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,260
...was very, very irresponsible.

146
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,270
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

147
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,270
Sirius Black, you mean?

148
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,190
But what's he got to do with me?

149
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,320
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

150
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,660
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

151
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,790
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

152
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,960
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

153
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,090
Hedwig.

154
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,340
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

155
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,100
...wander.

156
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,560
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

157
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,390
Housekeeping.

158
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,060
I'll come back later.

159
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,070
I'm warning you, Hermione.

160
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,950
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

161
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,200
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

162
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,370
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

163
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,080
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...

164
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,790
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

165
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,380
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

166
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,170
Harry.

167
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,680
Harry.

168
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,930
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

169
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,470
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

170
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,850
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.

171
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,190
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.

172
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,780
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

173
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,360
- The day maid.
- Night maid.

174
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,650
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.

175
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,240
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

176
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,580
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.

177
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,080
- Got everything?
- Yes.

178
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,410
- Yes? All your books?
- It's all upstairs.

179
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,000
- Your clothes?
- Everything.

180
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,580
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

181
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,630
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

182
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,300
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

183
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,130
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

184
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,930
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

185
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,850
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

186
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,690
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

187
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,190
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

188
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,940
You are in danger.

189
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,070
Grave danger.

190
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,200
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

191
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,410
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

192
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,290
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

193
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,790
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

194
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,800
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

195
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,300
Sorry.

196
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,380
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

197
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,180
...Black lost everything.

198
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,640
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

199
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,980
And in his mind...

200
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,150
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

201
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:32,070
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

202
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,400
And that is why...

203
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,110
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

204
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,160
To find you.

205
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,240
And kill me.

206
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,870
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

207
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,580
...you won't go looking for Black.

208
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,290
Mr. Weasley...

209
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,460
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

210
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,880
Quick. Quick.

211
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,010
Ron, Ron!

212
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,800
Oh, for goodness' sake!

213
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,470
Don't lose him!

214
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,600
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

215
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,230
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

216
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,980
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

217
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,900
I was lucky not to be arrested.

218
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,110
I still think it was brilliant.

219
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,030
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

220
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,240
Who do you think that is?

221
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,290
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

222
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,580
How is it she knows everything?

223
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,880
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

224
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,470
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

225
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,300
I gotta tell you something.

226
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,860
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

227
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,860
...to come after you?
- Yeah.

228
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,030
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

229
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,910
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

230
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,410
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

231
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,580
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

232
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,670
Why are we stopping?

233
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,460
We can't be there yet.

234
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,930
What's going on?

235
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,810
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

236
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,060
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

237
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,860
There's something moving out there.

238
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,500
I think someone's coming aboard.

239
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,570
Bloody hell! What's happening?

240
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,270
Harry.

241
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,190
Harry, are you all right?

242
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,030
Thank you.

243
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,660
Here, eat this. It'll help.

244
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,280
It's all right. It's chocolate.

245
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,670
What was that thing that came?

246
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,250
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

247
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,130
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

248
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,930
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

249
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,430
Eat. You'll feel better.

250
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,570
What happened to me?

251
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,480
Well, you sort of went rigid.

252
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,820
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

253
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,370
And did either of you two...

254
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,870
...you know...

255
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,120
...pass out?
- No.

256
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,000
I felt weird, though.

257
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,000
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

258
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,460
But someone was screaming.

259
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,010
A woman.

260
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,970
No one was screaming, Harry.

261
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,900
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

262
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,160
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

263
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,660
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

264
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,080
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

265
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,710
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

266
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,380
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

267
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,090
Good luck, professor.

268
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,010
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

269
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,850
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

270
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,690
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

271
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,860
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

272
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,400
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...

273
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,490
...has decided to retire...

274
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:35,410
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

275
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,330
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

276
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,330
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

277
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,830
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

278
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,890
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

279
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,600
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

280
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:07,980
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

281
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,110
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

282
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:16,740
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

283
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,570
Now whilst I've been assured...

284
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,410
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

285
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,910
...a word of caution.

286
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,290
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

287
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,880
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

288
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,670
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

289
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,470
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

290
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,350
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

291
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,770
But you know,
happiness can be found...

292
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,570
...even in the darkest of times...

293
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,660
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

294
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,670
Fortuna Major.

295
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,180
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

296
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,300
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no. Wait, wait.

297
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,310
Watch this.

298
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:39,030
- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.

299
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,780
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

300
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,790
Still doing that after three years.

301
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,120
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

302
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,500
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

303
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,920
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

304
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,050
Green. That's a monkey.

305
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,510
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

306
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,890
Do not give him one again.

307
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,680
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

308
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,530
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

309
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,820
I think we have a winner.

310
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,120
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

311
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,250
Look at him. His face.

312
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,130
Welcome, my children.

313
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:21,420
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

314
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:26,890
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

315
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:32,270
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

316
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,060
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

317
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:41,110
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

318
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,860
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

319
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,740
What do you see?

320
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:52,580
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

321
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,210
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

322
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:59,920
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

323
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,010
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

324
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,840
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

325
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,300
Is your grandmother quite well?

326
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,430
I think so.

327
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,390
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

328
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,770
Pity.

329
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,610
Broaden your minds.

330
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,530
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

331
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,620
- I think you are.
- Sure.

332
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,040
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

333
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,910
Yeah.

334
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:38,170
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

335
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,260
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

336
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,800
So...

337
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:48,010
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

338
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,550
Give me the cup.

339
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,020
Oh, my dear boy.

340
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,770
My dear...

341
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,530
...you have the Grim.

342
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,110
The Grin? What's the Grin?

343
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,160
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

344
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,490
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

345
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,160
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

346
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,370
It's an omen...

347
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,370
...of death."

348
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,720
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

349
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,840
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

350
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,680
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

351
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,980
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

352
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,810
A fair few.

353
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,060
Hang on. That's not possible.

354
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,030
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

355
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,190
You have to be in two
classes at once.

356
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,740
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

357
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:54,160
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."

358
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,290
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

359
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,290
I got a real treat for you today.

360
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,460
A great lesson. So follow me.

361
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,810
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

362
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,480
And open your books to page 49.

363
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,270
Exactly how do we do that?

364
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,360
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

365
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,540
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.

366
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,420
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

367
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,090
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

368
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,970
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

369
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,260
Shut up, Malfoy.

370
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,820
Dementor! Dementor!

371
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,920
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

372
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,540
Yeah.

373
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Isn't he beautiful?

374
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,560
Say hello to Buckbeak.

375
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,390
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

376
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,650
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

377
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,320
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

378
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:53,400
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

379
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,320
It may be the last thing you ever do.

380
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,870
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

381
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,500
Well done, Harry. Well done.

382
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,670
Come on now.

383
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,550
Now...

384
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,470
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

385
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,510
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

386
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,140
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

387
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,430
If he does, you can go and touch him.

388
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,810
If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.

389
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,520
Just make your bow.

390
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,780
Nice and low.

391
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,780
Back off, Harry. Back off.

392
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,160
Keep still.

393
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,830
Keep still.

394
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,430
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

395
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,480
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

396
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,520
Go on. Don't be shy.

397
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,410
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

398
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,160
Not so fast, Harry.

399
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,500
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

400
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,880
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

401
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,090
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

402
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,090
That's it...

403
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,050
Yes!

404
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,060
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

405
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,230
Does he get to fly?

406
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,810
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?

407
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,570
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

408
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,900
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

409
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:00,950
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

410
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:22,000
akumenang.com

411
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,390
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

412
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,510
That was wicked, Harry!

413
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,100
Oh, please.

414
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,230
Well done, well done.

415
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:56,110
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

416
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:03,740
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

417
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,320
Malfoy, no...

418
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,700
No!

419
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,040
Buckbeak!

420
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,370
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

421
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,330
Whoa! Buckbeak!

422
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,790
Away, you silly creature...

423
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,090
- It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

424
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,510
Hagrid!

425
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:28,890
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

426
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:34,810
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

427
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,270
You and your bloody chicken!

428
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,800
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

429
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,840
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

430
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,350
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

431
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,560
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

432
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:18,060
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

433
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,980
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

434
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,030
- He's been sighted!
- Who?

435
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,950
Sirius Black!

436
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,990
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

437
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:33,040
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

438
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,710
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

439
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:39,210
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

440
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,960
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

441
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,930
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

442
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,120
Intriguing, isn't it?

443
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,130
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

444
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,090
...as to what is inside?

445
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,300
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

446
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,970
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

447
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,220
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?

448
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,930
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

449
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,350
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

450
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,980
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

451
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:49,650
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

452
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,780
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

453
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,580
After me. Riddikulus!

454
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,910
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.

455
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,630
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

456
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,040
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!

457
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,340
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

458
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:11,550
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

459
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,470
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

460
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,100
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

461
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,400
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

462
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,940
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

463
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,610
Come on.

464
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,570
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

465
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,450
Professor Snape.

466
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,490
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

467
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,080
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

468
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:45,750
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.

469
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,840
No...

470
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,470
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

471
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,930
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

472
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,220
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.

473
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:02,270
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

474
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,770
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

475
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,150
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

476
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,070
Can you do that?

477
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:14,360
Yes. Wand at the ready.

478
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,200
One, two, three.

479
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,880
Think, Neville, think.

480
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,680
Riddikulus!

481
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,890
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

482
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,020
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

483
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,570
Form a line!

484
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,160
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

485
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,450
...and turn it into something funny.

486
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,370
Next! Ron!

487
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,130
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

488
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,140
Wand at the ready, Ron.

489
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,720
Riddikulus!

490
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,230
Yes!

491
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,730
You see? Very good, very good!

492
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:35,070
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

493
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,070
Show us what you see.

494
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:51,750
Keep your nerve. Steady.

495
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,880
Riddikulus!

496
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,880
And next! Step up, step up!

497
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,800
Wonderful, wonderful!

498
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,940
Here!

499
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,620
Riddikulus!

500
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,050
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

501
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,220
Collect your books from the back.

502
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,010
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

503
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,220
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

504
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:49,810
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

505
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,940
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

506
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:56,030
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

507
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,780
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

508
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,490
That's the rule, Potter.

509
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,910
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

510
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,580
I thought if you signed it,
then I could...

511
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,250
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

512
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,630
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

513
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,510
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

514
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,970
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

515
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,820
Professor, can I ask you something?

516
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,870
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

517
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,490
I thought it'd be obvious.

518
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,500
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

519
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:53,170
I did think of Voldemort at first.

520
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:56,000
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

521
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,710
...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.

522
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,760
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

523
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,430
This is very wise.

524
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,680
Before I fainted...

525
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,930
...I heard something.

526
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,100
A woman...

527
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,890
...screaming.

528
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,350
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

529
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,480
Our pain becomes their power.

530
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,530
I think it was my mother...

531
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,910
...the night she was murdered.

532
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:29,990
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

533
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,410
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

534
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:36,000
They're your mother, Lily's.

535
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,380
Yes.

536
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,710
Oh, yes. I knew her.

537
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:47,890
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

538
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,310
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

539
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:54,810
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

540
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:58,400
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

541
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:04,740
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

542
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,910
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

543
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,620
...he...

544
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,460
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

545
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:22,260
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

546
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,220
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

547
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:33,180
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

548
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,020
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

549
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,780
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

550
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,990
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.

551
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:50,870
What's going on?

552
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,490
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

553
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,080
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

554
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,540
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

555
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,840
Get back, all of you.

556
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:07,170
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

557
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,680
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

558
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,220
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

559
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,310
It's not funny, Ron.

560
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:21,400
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

561
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,780
- Be quiet.
- Make way.

562
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,950
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

563
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,030
You heard. Move!

564
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,130
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

565
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:54,560
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

566
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,850
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

567
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,810
The Fat Lady's there.

568
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,650
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

569
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:06,900
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

570
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,490
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

571
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:15,950
Dear lady, who did this to you?

572
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:22,920
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

573
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,840
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

574
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,470
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

575
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,880
Sirius Black!

576
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:37,220
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

577
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:10,210
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

578
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,970
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.

579
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:15,090
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.

580
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,930
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

581
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,640
I didn't really expect him to linger.

582
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:24,230
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

583
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,690
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

584
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,530
...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.

585
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,570
Any theories on how he managed it?

586
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,740
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

587
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,530
You may recall...

588
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,540
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

589
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,790
...about your appointment
of Professor...

590
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:46,040
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

591
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,630
I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...

592
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:52,420
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

593
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,930
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

594
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:57,760
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

595
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,350
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

596
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:10,150
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

597
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,820
Turn to page 394.

598
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,830
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

599
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:07,960
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

600
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:12,000
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

601
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:17,260
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

602
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,760
"Werewolves"?

603
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,850
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

604
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,230
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.

605
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,610
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

606
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:37,740
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

607
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:40,360
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

608
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,990
No one?

609
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:46,410
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.

610
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,790
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

611
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,500
A werewolf has no choice.

612
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,630
With each full moon...

613
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:57,670
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

614
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,470
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

615
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,390
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

616
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,890
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

617
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,060
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

618
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:13,560
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

619
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,280
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

620
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:22,070
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

621
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,990
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

622
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,750
...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.

623
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:33,170
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

624
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:37,420
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

625
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:41,380

626
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:44,850
The term "werewolf"...

627
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,270
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...

628
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:55,440
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

629
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:58,440
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

630
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,650
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

631
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,820
...being bitten by a werewolf...

632
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:26,260
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

633
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,890
Aresto momentum!

634
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:34,270
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

635
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:36,730
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

636
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:39,770
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

637
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,020
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

638
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,660
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

639
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,820
You gave us a right good scare.

640
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:55,580
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

641
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,210
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

642
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:04,340
No one blames you, Harry.

643
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:08,380
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

644
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:10,680
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

645
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,510
There's something else
you should know too.

646
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:21,400
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

647
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,400
Well...

648
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,940
I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.

649
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,900
Is there no chance of fixing it?

650
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:31,450
No.

651
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:34,950
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

652
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:38,450
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

653
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:41,790
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

654
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,250
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

655
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:51,380
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

656
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:55,810
You are not weak, Harry.

657
00:57:55,970 --> 00:58:00,060
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

658
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:03,350
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

659
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,110
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

660
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,360
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

661
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:14,030
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

662
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,200
You made the one
on the train go away.

663
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,160
There was only one that night.

664
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:23,040
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

665
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:28,340
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

666
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,170
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

667
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,260
For now, I need to rest.

668
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:04,000
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

669
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,600
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

670
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:24,690
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.

671
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:27,690
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.

672
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,070
We'll get you there.

673
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:31,940
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- Lf you pipe down.

674
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,700
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

675
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,910
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

676
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:42,450
What are you doing?!

677
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,540
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

678
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:49,040
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...

679
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:52,130
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

680
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,050
George, if you will.

681
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:57,510
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

682
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,730
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...

683
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:08,100
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

684
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:10,610
We owe them so much.

685
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:17,990
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...

686
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,620
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.

687
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,120
- In his study.
- Pacing.

688
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:24,250
Does that a lot.

689
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:26,290
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.

690
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,500
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.

691
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:29,790
- Every minute.
- Every day.

692
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,960
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.

693
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,880
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...

694
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,720
...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

695
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:42,050
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.

696
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,060
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

697
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,640
And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

698
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:52,150
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

699
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,690
Now, how much do you want?

700
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,900
Delicious.

701
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:51,000
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

702
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:52,830
Twice.

703
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,880
Do you want to move a bit closer?

704
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:57,800
To the Shrieking Shack?

705
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:00,970
Actually, I'm fine here.

706
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,970
Well, well. Look who's here.

707
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,640
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

708
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:10,140
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

709
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:13,560
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

710
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:18,990
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

711
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:22,610
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

712
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,780
You filthy little mudblood!

713
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,540
Who is that?

714
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:39,130
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

715
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,240
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

716
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,620
Get out of the way!

717
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,410
Move!

718
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,870
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

719
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:17,590
Harry!

720
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:21,800
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

721
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:26,220
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

722
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:29,850
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

723
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:34,060
- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

724
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:36,730
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

725
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,230
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

726
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,280
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

727
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,820
Allow me, minister.

728
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:44,860
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

729
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:47,990
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

730
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:52,080
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

731
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:56,290
...into my pub every other night!
- We have...

732
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:59,920
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

733
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,710
And what would bring him here?

734
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,050
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?

735
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,970
Come.

736
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:13,520
Harry!

737
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:25,700
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

738
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,910
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

739
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,740
- Thick heads?!
- How dare they!

740
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:33,120
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!

741
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:37,790
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

742
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,880
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

743
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:46,470
Tell me what this is all about.

744
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:51,100
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...

745
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:53,930
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

746
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,980
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

747
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:01,400
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

748
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,940
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

749
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:07,360
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

750
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:09,780
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.

751
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:11,780
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

752
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,700
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters...

753
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:19,040
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

754
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:23,090
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

755
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,460
He destroyed him!

756
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:30,840
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

757
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:34,060
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

758
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:37,430
...but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.

759
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,480
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.

760
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:44,440
- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...

761
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,780
...and remains to this day...

762
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,860
...Harry Potter's godfather!

763
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,790
Ron, look!

764
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,090
- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.

765
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,380
Harry, what happened?

766
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,010
He was their friend...

767
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,760
...and he betrayed them.

768
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:58,510
He was their friend!

769
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:02,730
I hope he finds me.

770
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:05,690
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

771
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:08,770
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

772
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,670
Harry.

773
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:26,830
There you are. You came.

774
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:31,090
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...

775
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,720
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

776
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,430
I'm sure.

777
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,470
Well, everything's prepared.

778
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,100
The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

779
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:43,770
Did you ever hear of it?

780
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:45,600
No? Well...

781
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:49,360
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

782
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:54,200
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

783
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:58,200
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

784
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:02,330
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

785
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:06,330
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

786
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:09,750
Close your eyes.

787
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:13,420
Concentrate.

788
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:16,760
Explore your past.

789
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,140
Do you have a memory?

790
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,930
Allow it to fill you up.

791
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,730
Lose yourself within it.

792
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:31,400
Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.

793
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:34,650
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.

794
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:41,780
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

795
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:02,220
Expecto Patronum!

796
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:06,350
Expecto... Expecto...

797
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,310
Expect...

798
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:14,400
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

799
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:18,490
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

800
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:24,040
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

801
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:27,750
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

802
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,710
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

803
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,050
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

804
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:36,840
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

805
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:40,720
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

806
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:45,260
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

807
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:57,400
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

808
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,450
Well, it is.

809
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:04,200
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

810
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:08,330
...but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?

akumenang.com

812
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:15,550
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

814

Just do it.

01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:22,000
akumenang.com

816
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:32,400
Expecto Patronum!

817
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:37,610
Expecto Patronum!

818
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:00,300
Yes!

819
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:05,680
Well done, Harry. Well done!

820
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:10,350
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.

821
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,940
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

822
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,900
And just so you know, Harry...

823
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:19,070
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

824
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:21,280
...is saying something.

825
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:25,450
I was thinking of him.

826
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,780
And Mum.

827
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,200
Seeing their faces.

828
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:33,540
They were talking to me.

829
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:35,960
Just talking.

830
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:38,460
That's the memory I chose.

831
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:42,550
I don't even know if it's real.

832
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:45,220
But it's the best I have.

833
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,770
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

834
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:58,940
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

835
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:01,530
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

836
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:04,860
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!

837
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:07,160
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

838
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:10,660
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

839
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:14,750
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

840
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:17,790
Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

841
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,040
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.

842
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,710
- Did.
- Didn't.

843
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,380
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

844
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:29,850
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

845
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:32,680
...talking about why we were there.

846
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,230
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

847
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,360
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

848
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:43,610
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

849
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:46,990
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

850
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:50,200
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

851
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:52,200
And then?

852
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,620
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

853
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:59,920
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.

854
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,010
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

855
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:37,410
Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

856
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:40,170
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.

857
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:44,340
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...

858
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,650
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

859
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:07,940
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.

860
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:10,610
He didn 't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!

861
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:22,170
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

862
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:09,550
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

863
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,350
Mischief managed. Nox.

864
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,900
Potter.

865
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:27,570
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

866
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,900
I was sleepwalking.

867
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:31,610
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

868
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:36,530
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

869
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:41,080
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

870
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:44,920
If you don't mind, I would appreciate
it if you could lower your wand.

871
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,340
Turn out your pockets.

872
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:54,630
Turn out your pockets!

873
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:59,180
What's this?

874
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:02,600
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

875
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:12,860
Reveal your secrets.

876
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,120
Read it.

877
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:26,080
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

878
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:30,380
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."

879
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:32,170
Go on.

880
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:37,220
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."

881
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:39,970
- You insolent little...
- Professor!

882
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,310
Well, well. Lupin.

883
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:49,190
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?

884
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:52,980
Harry, are you all right?

885
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:55,650
That remains to be seen.

886
01:16:56,490 --> 01:17:00,240
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

887
01:17:00,410 --> 01:17:03,950
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

888
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:08,920
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.

889
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,590
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

890
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:16,630
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

891
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:21,050
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

892
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:24,350
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

893
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,850
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

894
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:36,610
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

895
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,160
Come in.

896
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:50,170
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...

897
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:54,840
...but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

898
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,670
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

899
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,840
...is a map to you?

900
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:04,140
- No.
- No, sir.

901
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:09,190
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

902
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:13,690
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

903
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:18,400
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...

904
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:23,030
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

905
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,410
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

906
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:28,040
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

907
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,870
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

908
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:36,800
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

909
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:45,890
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

910
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:51,730
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

911
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,900
Oh, really? And who might that be?

912
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:56,610
Peter Pettigrew.

913
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,320
That's not possible.

914
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:04,200
It's just what I saw.

915
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:08,740
Good night, professor.

916
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:16,420
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

917
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:22,010
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

918
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:25,510
Only then can you see. Try again.

919
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:28,140
Now, what do we have here?

920
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:32,690
Do you mind me trying?

921
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:38,070
The Grim, possibly.

922
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:44,320
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

923
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:48,280
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

924
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:52,370
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

925
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:56,210
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

926
01:19:56,380 --> 01:20:00,380
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

927
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:03,670
...to which you so desperately cleave.

928
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:21,190
Have I said something?

929
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:30,870
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...

930
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,620
...but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.

931
01:20:33,790 --> 01:20:35,960
Hang on.

932
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:39,040
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.

933
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:42,800
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

934
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:25,840
Harry Potter...

935
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:36,980
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.

936
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,770
Sorry?

937
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:43,610
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

938
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:45,820
...shall break free.

939
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:48,240
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

940
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:54,410
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

941
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:04,000
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

942
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,590
No.

943
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:08,590
Nothing.

944
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:05,230
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

945
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,150
- It just got worse.
- What did I say? Father said...

946
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:12,490
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

947
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:15,120
This is going to be rich.

948
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,490
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?

949
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:20,790
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

950
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,710
Hermione, no!

951
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:25,540
He's not worth it.

952
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,680
Malfoy, are you okay?

953
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:46,110
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

954
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:50,690
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

955
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:14,430
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

956
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:16,890
Why don't we just set him free?

957
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:19,470
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

958
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,640
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.

959
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:25,190
Says he wants to be with me
when they...

960
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:28,230
When it happens.

961
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,730
Great man, Dumbledore.

962
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:32,280
A great man.

963
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:37,740
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!

964
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:41,080
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

965
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:44,910
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

966
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:54,720
Scabbers! You're alive!

967
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,590
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.

968
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:02,520
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

969
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,770
I meant me!

970
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,690
Blimey. What was that?

971
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,570
Hagrid!

972
01:25:16,490 --> 01:25:17,820
Oh, crikey.

973
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,030
No, minister. Over this way.

974
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:26,330
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

975
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:30,290
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

976
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:34,050
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

977
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,880
Quick. Quick!

978
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:39,800
Hagrid.

979
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:43,890
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!

980
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:48,520
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.

981
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:51,360
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

982
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,230
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.

983
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:58,280
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.

984
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,950
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

985
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:06,500
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

986
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:11,250
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

987
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:14,590
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

988
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:20,260
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

989
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:23,970
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

990
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:28,560
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...

991
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:30,480
What?

992
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:32,730
I thought I just saw...

993
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:35,020
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

994
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:42,450
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

995
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:30,410
Oh, no.

996
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,550
He bit me. Scabbers.

997
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:46,100
Ron. Ron!

998
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:50,600
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

999
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,850
Wait!

1000
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:04,070
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

1001
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,530
That's not good. Ron, run!

1002
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:12,200
Harry, Hermione, run!

1003
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:14,420
It's the Grim!

1004
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:24,470
- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

1005
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,680
Harry!

1006
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:30,640
- Help!
- Ron!

1007
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:36,020
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

1008
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:52,870
Come on!

1009
01:28:54,790 --> 01:28:56,210
Move!

1010
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:02,000
Duck!

1011
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:40,170
Harry!

1012
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:59,060
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

1013
01:29:59,230 --> 01:30:03,150
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.

1014
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:05,190
I just hope I'm wrong.

1015
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:28,050
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1016
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:30,760
Come on.

1017
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:42,520
Ron.

1018
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:45,690
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

1019
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:49,110
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1020
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,800
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1021
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,760
No. Only one will die tonight.

1022
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,880
Then it'll be you!

1023
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:18,270
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1024
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,310
Expelliarmus!

1025
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:29,190
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1026
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,450
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1027
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:36,660
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?

1028
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:48,130
- I found him.
- I know.

1029
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,590
- It's him.
- I understand.

1030
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,970
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

1031
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:57,140
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1032
01:31:57,850 --> 01:32:00,890
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1033
01:32:03,690 --> 01:32:05,400
How long have you known?

1034
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:09,110
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.

1035
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:12,240
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

1036
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,820
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1037
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:17,660
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!

1038
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:20,240
Twelve years of it!

1039
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:23,250
In Azkaban!

1040
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,470
Very well. Kill him.

1041
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:38,800
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1042
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,560
I know why.

1043
01:32:40,770 --> 01:32:43,020
You betrayed my parents.

1044
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:46,100
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.

1045
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:48,190
Somebody did betray your parents...

1046
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:51,860
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

1047
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:55,530
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

1048
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:58,820
And he's in this room! Right now!

1049
01:32:59,330 --> 01:33:02,290
Come out, come out, Peter!

1050
01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:05,460
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!

1051
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:10,920
Vengeance is sweet.

1052
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:13,340
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

1053
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:14,840
Severus...

1054
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:19,760
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

1055
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:21,260
Brilliant, Snape.

1056
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:25,810
You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

1057
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:28,690
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...

1058
01:33:28,850 --> 01:33:33,860
...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!

1059
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:36,610
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.

1060
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:38,410
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!

1061
01:33:38,570 --> 01:33:40,990
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1062
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,700
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!

1063
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:46,750
I could do it, you know.

1064
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:52,840
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1065
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,720
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1066
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:59,390
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

1067
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:04,970
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.

1068
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:07,440
Severus, please.

1069
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,480
After you.

1070
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:16,650
Expelliarmus!

1071
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,990
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

1072
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:24,790
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.

1073
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:26,620
We thought he was our friend!

1074
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:29,790
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

1075
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:33,170
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!

1076
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:36,170
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

1077
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:40,340
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

1078
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:45,390
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!

1079
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:48,810
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?

1080
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:51,480
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1081
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:54,230
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?

1082
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,360
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!

1083
01:34:57,570 --> 01:35:00,820
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1084
01:35:00,990 --> 01:35:04,030
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

1085
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:09,710
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

1086
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:10,960
Scabbers!

1087
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:14,210
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1088
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:38,530
Remus?

1089
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,780
Sirius.

1090
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:42,860
My old friends!

1091
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:52,330
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1092
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:56,170
- James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!

1093
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,630
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1094
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:05,050
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!

1095
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:08,060
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1096
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:10,890
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1097
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:16,860
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!

1098
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:21,400
James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

1099
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:27,280
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1100
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:31,950
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!

1101
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:34,210
No!

1102
01:36:35,710 --> 01:36:39,670
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.

1103
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,760
But we'll take him to the castle.

1104
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:46,970
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!

1105
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:50,510
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1106
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:53,100
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1107
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:00,780
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1108
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:04,490
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1109
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:06,200
I was going for the rat.

1110
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:10,200
Normally, I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.

1111
01:37:10,370 --> 01:37:15,620
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1112
01:37:15,790 --> 01:37:20,670
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

1113
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:34,730
Okay.

1114
01:37:39,730 --> 01:37:42,280
- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?

1115
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,860
It's fine. I'll stay.

1116
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:46,610
You go, I'll stay.

1117
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:50,030
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

1118
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:54,620
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.

1119
01:37:54,790 --> 01:37:57,370
They might chop it.

1120
01:37:57,830 --> 01:38:00,500
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1121
01:38:00,670 --> 01:38:04,880
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1122
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:07,970
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1123
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,560
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1124
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:16,430
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1125
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,400
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1126
01:38:22,190 --> 01:38:24,360
He doesn't deserve it.

1127
01:38:24,530 --> 01:38:27,700
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...

1128
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,410
...to become killers.

1129
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:33,280
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1130
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:35,830
Alive, you're free.

1131
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,080
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1132
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:42,630
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1133
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:45,300
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

1134
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:49,510
- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!

1135
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:53,890
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1136
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:58,140
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1137
01:38:58,310 --> 01:39:00,270
I know.

1138
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:05,480
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1139
01:39:05,650 --> 01:39:08,150
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...

1140
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,820
What? Come and live with you?

1141
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:15,280
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1142
01:39:15,490 --> 01:39:17,040
Harry!

1143
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:36,140
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1144
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:42,810
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

1145
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:46,150
This flesh is only flesh!

1146
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:49,400
Expelliarmus!

1147
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,040
Harry!

1148
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:05,080
Remus! Remus!

1149
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:13,630
Run! Run!

1150
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:25,690
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

1151
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:30,940
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1152
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:33,360
Professor?

1153
01:40:37,450 --> 01:40:38,990
Professor Lupin?

1154
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:50,000
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1155
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:52,970
There you are, Potter!

1156
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:27,790
Sirius!

1157
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:31,050
Come back here, Potter!

1158
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:38,280
Sirius!

1159
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:42,030
No. Sirius!

1160
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:26,790
Expecto Patronum!

1161
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:41,960
Harry?

1162
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,260
I saw my dad.

1163
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:47,010
What?

1164
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:48,760
He sent the dementors away.

1165
01:45:48,930 --> 01:45:50,350
I saw him across the lake.

1166
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:52,180
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1167
01:45:52,390 --> 01:45:55,230
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1168
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:57,900
- They're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

1169
01:45:58,100 --> 01:45:59,940
Much worse.

1170
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:02,480
They're going to suck out his soul.

1171
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:05,570
Headmaster, stop them.

1172
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:09,120
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true. Sirius is innocent.

1173
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,490
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

1174
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:13,040
He's my rat, sir.

1175
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:17,250
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1176
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:21,130
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.

1177
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:23,840
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.

1178
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:29,470
But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1179
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,350
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

1180
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:39,270
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1181
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:47,030
Mysterious thing, time.

1182
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:49,530
Powerful...

1183
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:52,580
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1184
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:57,790
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

1185
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:00,710
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1186
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,670
You must not be seen.

1187
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:06,510
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

1188
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:10,220
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1189
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:12,550
If you succeed tonight...

1190
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:15,560
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1191
01:47:17,390 --> 01:47:19,600
Three turns should do it, I think.

1192
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,320
Oh, and by the way.

1193
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:32,320
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1194
01:47:32,490 --> 01:47:34,580
Good luck.

1195
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:37,540
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1196
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,540
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...

1197
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:11,150
What just happened?

1198
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:13,610
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

1199
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:15,660
Where were we at 7:30?

1200
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:17,620
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1201
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:20,160
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1202
01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:23,080
Hermione!

1203
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:43,940
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1204
01:48:45,730 --> 01:48:49,320
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1205
01:48:49,530 --> 01:48:52,360
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1206
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:53,860
That's us.

1207
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:56,990
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1208
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:58,660
This is not normal.

1209
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:03,330
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1210
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:05,710
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1211
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:09,210
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1212
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:12,630
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

1213
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:16,180
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1214
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:21,640
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1215
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:26,100
Good punch.

1216
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:27,770
Thanks.

1217
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:30,440
Malfoy's coming.

1218
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:33,690
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

1219
01:49:34,150 --> 01:49:37,240
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1220
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:41,330
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

1221
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:45,290
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1222
01:50:04,430 --> 01:50:06,980
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1223
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:10,310
Of course.

1224
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,480
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1225
01:50:12,650 --> 01:50:16,700
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1226
01:50:17,070 --> 01:50:18,410
Let's go.

1227
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:41,800
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1228
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:44,470
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1229
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:47,100
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1230
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:50,520
Scabbers, you're alive!

1231
01:50:50,690 --> 01:50:53,480
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

1232
01:50:53,690 --> 01:50:56,610
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.

1233
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:59,780
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

1234
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:06,370
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1235
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:09,370
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1236
01:51:09,540 --> 01:51:12,420
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

1237
01:51:12,590 --> 01:51:14,840
We can't be seen.

1238
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:19,840
Fudge is coming.

1239
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:22,850
And we aren't leaving?

1240
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:26,600
Why aren't we leaving?

1241
01:51:37,530 --> 01:51:39,070
Are you mad?

1242
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:46,450
That hurt.

1243
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:48,000
Sorry.

1244
01:52:08,850 --> 01:52:11,520
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1245
01:52:28,910 --> 01:52:31,750
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1246
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:35,130
What?

1247
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,840
I thought I just saw...

1248
01:52:38,050 --> 01:52:40,720
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

1249
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:57,320
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1250
01:53:03,570 --> 01:53:05,530
Get away. Get off.

1251
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:31,140
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

1252
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:35,140
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

1253
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:39,150
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1254
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:46,320
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1255
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:52,500
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1256
01:53:53,330 --> 01:53:56,620
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...

1257
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,710
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1258
01:54:01,420 --> 01:54:04,380
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1259
01:54:04,590 --> 01:54:06,880
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1260
01:54:09,510 --> 01:54:14,020
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1261
01:54:14,230 --> 01:54:15,890
- Now, look there.
- Where?

1262
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:19,480
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?

1263
01:54:19,650 --> 01:54:23,150
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1264
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:26,150
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.

1265
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:29,990
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.

1266
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:31,330
- Over there.
- Where?

1267
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:33,240
- Over there.
- This way.

1268
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:36,120
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.

1269
01:54:37,790 --> 01:54:39,500
But where is it?

1270
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:42,630
I saw the beast, just now.

1271
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:45,460
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.

1272
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:46,970
Buckbeak.

1273
01:54:47,170 --> 01:54:51,260
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1274
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:52,760
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

1275
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:57,230
I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this.

1276
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:00,270
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1277
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:02,320
- Right.
- Well, well.

1278
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,030
We must search the grounds.

1279
01:55:04,190 --> 01:55:07,240
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1280
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:12,830
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1281
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:17,000
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1282
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:19,040
Thank you.

1283
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:22,540
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1284
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:34,810
- Come on.
- This way.

1285
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:43,400
This way, now.

1286
01:55:45,820 --> 01:55:47,570
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

1287
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:50,280
- How?
- No idea.

1288
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:01,960
- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!

1289
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:10,380
And Snape's coming.

1290
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:18,270
And now we wait.

1291
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:21,270
And now we wait.

1292
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:52,090
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.

1293
01:56:54,890 --> 01:56:56,680
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

1294
01:56:56,850 --> 01:57:01,180
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

1295
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:03,480
...I did see someone.

1296
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:07,060
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1297
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:08,570
With a Patronus.

1298
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:10,650
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1299
01:57:10,820 --> 01:57:12,280
According to him...

1300
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:15,870
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1301
01:57:16,030 --> 01:57:17,910
It was my dad.

1302
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:20,830
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1303
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,250
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead. I know.

1304
01:57:24,670 --> 01:57:27,000
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1305
01:57:31,130 --> 01:57:32,760
Here we come.

1306
01:57:38,430 --> 01:57:40,810
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1307
01:57:40,970 --> 01:57:43,810
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.

1308
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:47,310
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1309
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:49,110
It'll just be me and him.

1310
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:51,730
We could live in the country...

1311
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:54,530
...someplace you can see the sky.

1312
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:57,530
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1313
01:57:58,570 --> 01:58:00,120
Harry!

1314
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:03,370
Run!

1315
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:11,800
Let's go.

1316
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:33,690
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

1317
01:58:37,950 --> 01:58:39,320
Thanks.

1318
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:45,200
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1319
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:02,070
That was so scary.

1320
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:05,200
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1321
02:00:16,630 --> 02:00:19,760
Sirius. Come on!

1322
02:00:35,770 --> 02:00:37,900
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

1323
02:00:38,070 --> 02:00:41,280
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1324
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,830
Any minute now.

1325
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:54,080
Right there. You'll see.

1326
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:57,960
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

1327
02:00:58,130 --> 02:01:00,670
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1328
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:07,260
- Sirius.
- You're dying...

1329
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:11,180
...both of you.

1330
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:14,980
Harry!

1331
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:20,780
Expecto Patronum!

1332
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:20,960
You were right, Hermione.

1333
02:02:21,130 --> 02:02:24,470
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1334
02:02:24,630 --> 02:02:27,390
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1335
02:02:27,550 --> 02:02:29,930
I knew I could do it
this time because...

1336
02:02:30,100 --> 02:02:31,810
...well, I had already done it.

1337
02:02:31,970 --> 02:02:34,430
- Does that make sense?
- No.

1338
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:37,440
But I don't like flying...!

1339
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:51,910
Bombarda!

1340
02:03:25,230 --> 02:03:28,030
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1341
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:29,530
...to both of you.

1342
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:32,620
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

1343
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:35,700
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

1344
02:03:35,870 --> 02:03:37,620
And besides...

1345
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:41,830
...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.

1346
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,130
And you know it.

1347
02:03:45,210 --> 02:03:47,090
And for now, that will do.

1348
02:03:49,430 --> 02:03:51,970
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1349
02:03:52,970 --> 02:03:55,510
...but you look so like your father.

1350
02:03:57,270 --> 02:03:59,230
Except your eyes.

1351
02:04:00,190 --> 02:04:02,480
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.

1352
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:09,530
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1353
02:04:10,110 --> 02:04:11,610
But know this:

1354
02:04:12,740 --> 02:04:15,910
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1355
02:04:17,290 --> 02:04:19,250
And you can always find them...

1356
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:23,500
...in here.

1357
02:04:33,890 --> 02:04:36,430
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

1358
02:05:03,250 --> 02:05:04,880
We have to go.

1359
02:05:33,150 --> 02:05:35,820
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

1360
02:05:35,990 --> 02:05:37,530
Did what?

1361
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:39,660
Good night.

1362
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:49,750
How did you get there?

1363
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:52,590
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1364
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:55,550
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.

1365
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:59,260
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1366
02:06:25,750 --> 02:06:27,250
Hello, Harry.

1367
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:32,710
I saw you coming.

1368
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:39,970
I've looked worse, believe me.

1369
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:45,850
- You've been sacked.
- No.

1370
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:48,980
No. I resigned, actually.

1371
02:06:49,150 --> 02:06:50,940
Resigned? Why?

1372
02:06:51,110 --> 02:06:56,400
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1373
02:06:56,570 --> 02:07:02,080
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

1374
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:05,620
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1375
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:07,750
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already...

1376
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:09,790
...risked enough on my behalf.

1377
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:13,210
Besides, people like me are...

1378
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:17,170
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1379
02:07:26,730 --> 02:07:29,310
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1380
02:07:29,480 --> 02:07:31,650
None of it made any difference.

1381
02:07:31,810 --> 02:07:35,360
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?

1382
02:07:35,530 --> 02:07:39,030
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

1383
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:41,700
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1384
02:07:42,070 --> 02:07:44,580
It made a great deal of difference.

1385
02:07:49,210 --> 02:07:51,420
If I am proud of anything...

1386
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:54,250
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1387
02:07:54,420 --> 02:07:57,170
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

1388
02:07:57,340 --> 02:08:01,590
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1389
02:08:02,510 --> 02:08:05,010
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1390
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:07,770
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1391
02:08:08,310 --> 02:08:09,640
Until then...

1392
02:08:10,980 --> 02:08:12,690
...mischief managed.

1393
02:08:46,930 --> 02:08:51,140
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1394
02:08:51,310 --> 02:08:52,730
Harry.

1395
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:54,940
Wherever did you get it?

1396
02:08:55,110 --> 02:08:57,530
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1397
02:08:57,690 --> 02:08:59,860
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

1398
02:09:00,030 --> 02:09:03,320
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1399
02:09:03,490 --> 02:09:05,990
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1400
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:07,660
Did not.

1401
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:12,540
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.

1402
02:09:12,710 --> 02:09:14,250
For me?

1403
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:16,960
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

1404
02:09:17,130 --> 02:09:19,050
This came with it.

1405
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:25,550
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.

1406
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:27,560
How fast is it, Harry?

1407
02:09:46,910 --> 02:09:48,530
Lumos.

1408
02:09:48,700 --> 02:09:51,120
I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.

1409
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:12,090
Mischief managed.

1410
02:21:17,850 --> 02:21:19,310
Nox.
